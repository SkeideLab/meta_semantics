# data/

Contains the raw data that went into the meta-analysis: spreadsheets that document our literature search and the peak coordinates for all semantic fMRI experiments with children (as individual `.csv` files). The additional peak coordinate file for the adult meta-analysis was kindly provided to us by Rebecca L. Jackson, author of the [original paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117444).
