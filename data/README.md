Contains the raw data that went into the meta-analysis: Spreadsheets with information about our literature search and about the included experiments as well as, for the latter, their peak coordinates as individual `.csv` files. The additional peak coordinate file for the adult meta-analysis was kindly provided to us by Rebecca L. Jackson, author of the [original paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117444).
