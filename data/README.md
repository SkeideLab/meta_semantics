# data/

This directory contains the raw data that went into the meta-analysis. These consist of (a) two spreadsheets in `.csv` format that document the literature search and selection process, to be found under [`literature_search/`](https://github.com/alexenge/meta_semantics/tree/main/data/literature_search), (b) the peak coordinates (also in `.csv` format) of all included experiments, to be found under [`peaks/`](https://github.com/alexenge/meta_semantics/tree/main/data/peaks), and (c) the data which we have (re-)used to perform the meta-analysis of semantic cognition in *adults* (rather than children), to be found under [`adults/`](https://github.com/alexenge/meta_semantics/tree/main/data/adults). The latter was kindly provided to us by Rebecca L. Jackson, author of the [original paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117444).
