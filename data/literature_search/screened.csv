The suite of neuroimaging studies described in this dissertation share an underlying theme of how the brain supports reading fluency and expertise. The first experiment explored a basic component of reading, letter identification. Participants matched a target letter with two alternatives. Conditions included same-case (a-a), mixed-case (a-A), and Korean letter matching across two levels of difficulty. Across the ventral visual stream, Korean letters produced the greatest signal activation. The mixed and same-case conditions activated the ventral stream to a lesser extent and were indistinguishable from one another. Additional activation (mixed>same>Korean and hard>easy) was observed in left perisylvian area reflecting phonological processing. Thus letter categorization depends on phonological information in letter names, rather than a ventral visual area dedicated to abstract representations of letters. The second set of experiments gathered function snapshots of early word-processing that occur within the first few hundred milliseconds of processing. Words with varying frequencies were presented for short durations via gated masking to leverage brain activation information about the time course of word processing. This method failed to distinguish between factors of interest. The long mask presentation may have generated extra-strong visual activity, obscuring subtle differences between conditions. Moreover, it was assumed that the mask limited processing, however, it may not have completely extinguished processing. In the third experiment, children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) participated in a combined behavioral and neuroimaging study to explore the disorder's consequences on reading organization. Two control groups were used: the standard age-matched group and a group of younger typically developing children with comparable language and reading skills. The results suggest that when equated for language skills, children with SLI still employ differential neural processing strategies to overcome their severe phonological weakness. Together, these three experiments yield a more detailed picture of the neural computations that support reading and literacy.

Functional MRI scans were obtained while children viewed faces and houses. A developmental change was observed: Older children, but not younger children, showed significantly more activation in bilateral fusiform gyri for faces than for houses. Activation in the fusiform gyrus correlated significantly with age and with a behavioral measure of configural face processing. Regions believed to be involved in processing basic facial features were activated in both younger and older children. Some evidence was also observed for greater activation for houses versus faces for the older children than for the younger children, suggesting that processing of these two stimulus types becomes more differentiated as children age.

We examined the relationship between the strength of language lateralization and neuropsychological measures and task performance. The fundamental language network is established by four with ongoing maturation of language functions as evidenced by strengthening of lateralization in the traditional frontotemporal language regions; temporal regions were strongly and consistently lateralized by age seven, while frontal regions had greater variability and were less strongly lateralized through age 10.

The goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to determine whether these regions are systematically related to semantic processing in children (9- to 15-year-old) diagnosed with reading disorders (RD). Semantic judgments required participants to indicate whether two words were related in meaning. The strength of semantic association varied continuously from higher association pairs (e.g., king-queen) to lower association pairs (e.g. net-ship). We found that the correlation between association strength and activation was significantly weaker for RD children compared to controls in left middle temporal gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule for both the auditory and the visual modalities and in left inferior frontal gyrus for the visual modality.

Objective: To identify, using fMRI, brain regions involved in processing written text in children. Methods: The authors studied nine normal right-handed native English-speaking children, aged 10.2 years (range 7.9 to 13.3 years), with two paradigms: reading Aesop’s Fables and “Read Response Naming” (reading a description of an object that was then silently named). Data were acquired using blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI. Group data were analyzed with statistical parametric mapping; individual data sets were analyzed with a region-of-interest approach from individual study t maps. The number of activated pixels was determined in brain regions and an asymmetry index (AI = [L − R]/[L + R]) calculated for each region. Results: The authors found strong activation in the left middle temporal gyrus and left midfrontal gyrus and variable activation in left inferior frontal gyrus for both reading tasks in the group analysis (z > 5.5 to 9.1). All subjects had strong left-sided lateralization for both tasks in middle/superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus (AI = 0.76 to 1.0 for t = 4). Reading Fables activated twice as many pixels in temporal cortex as the Read Response Naming task; activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was similar for both tasks. Small homologous right middle temporal region activation was seen with reading a fable.

The goal of the current study was to examine the structural and functional connectivity in networks supporting reading comprehension and their relationship with language comprehension within 7-9 year old children using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and fMRI during a Sentence Picture Matching task. Fractional Anisotropy (FA) values in the left and right Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus (ILF) and Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF), known language-related tracts, were correlated from DTI data with scores from the Woodcock-Johnson III (WJ-III) Passage Comprehension sub-test. Brodmann areas most proximal to white-matter regions with significant correlation to Passage Comprehension scores were chosen as Regions-of-Interest (ROIs) and used as seeds in a functional connectivity analysis using the Sentence Picture Matching task. The correlation between percentile scores for the WJ-III Passage Comprehension subtest and the FA values in the right and left ILF and SLF indicated positive correlation in language-related ROIs, with greater distribution in the right hemisphere, which in turn showed strong connectivity in the fMRI data from the Sentence Picture Matching task. These results support the participation of the right hemisphere in reading comprehension and may provide physiologic support for a distinction between different types of reading comprehension deficits vs difficulties in technical reading.

To test this issue, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the neural amplitude, peak location, and the dispersion of tool-related neural responses in the youngest sample of children tested to date in this domain (ages 4-8 years).We showthat children recruit overlapping regions of the adult tool-processing network and also exhibit similar patterns of co-activation across the network to adults. The amplitude and co-activation data showthat the core components of the toolprocessing network are established by age 4.

These language difficulties occur in 7% of children and are known to limit future academic and social achievement. Our understanding of the brain abnormalities associated with DLD is limited. Here, we used a simple four-minute verb generation task (children saw a picture of an object and were instructed to say an action that goes with that object) to test children between the ages of 10–15 years (DLD N = 50, typically developing N = 67). We also tested 26 children with poor language ability who did not meet our criteria for DLD. Contrary to our registered predictions, we found that children with DLD did not have (i) reduced activity in language relevant regions such as the left inferior frontal cortex; (ii) dysfunctional striatal activity during overt production; or (iii) a reduction in left-lateralised activity in frontal cortex. Indeed, performance of this simple language task evoked activity in children with DLD in the same regions and to a similar level as in typically developing children. Consistent with previous reports, we found sub-threshold group differences in the left inferior frontal gyrus and caudate nuclei, but only when analysis was limited to a subsample of the DLD group (N = 14) who had the poorest performance on the task. Additionally, we used a two-factor model to capture variation in all children studied (N = 143) on a range of neuropsychological tests and found that these language and verbal memory factors correlated with activity in different brain regions. Our findings indicate a lack of support for some neurological models of atypical language learning, such as the procedural deficit hypothesis or the atypical lateralization hypothesis, at least when using simple language tasks that children can perform.

Two semantic tasks were used: visual-visual versus visual-auditory presentation. The first word was visually presented (i.e. character) and the second word was either visually or auditorily presented, and the participant had to determine if these two words were related in meaning. Different from English, Chinese has many homophones in which each spoken word corresponds to many characters. The visual-auditory task, therefore, required greater engagement of cognitive control for the participants to select a semantically appropriate answer for the second homophonic word. Weaker association pairs produced greater activation in the mid-ventral region of left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45) for both tasks. However, this effect was stronger for the visual-auditory task than for the visual-visual task and this difference was stronger for older compared to younger children.

However, it is not known how functional connectivity with this region changes developmentally, and whether functional connectivity is related to future gains in reading. We conducted a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 30 typically developing children (aged 8–15) to examine whether initial brain measures, including activation and connectivity, can predict future behavioral improvement in a semantic judgment task. Participants were scanned on entering the study (time 1, T1) and a follow-up period of 2 years (time 2, T2). Character pairs were arranged in a continuous variable according to association strength (i.e. strong versus weak), and participants were asked to determine if these visually presented pairs were related in meaning. Our results demonstrated greater developmental changes from time 1 to time 2 for weaker association pairs in the left pMTG for the children (aged 8–11) as compared to the adolescents (aged 12–15). Moreover, the results showed greater developmental changes from time 1 to time 2 for weaker association pairs in connectivity between the pMTG and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) for the children as compared to the adolescents. Furthermore, a hierarchical stepwise regression model revealed that connectivity between the pMTG and IPL in weak association pairs was uniquely predictive of behavioral improvement from time 1 to time 2 for the children, but not the adolescents. Taken together, the activation results suggest relatively rapid development before adolescence of semantic representations in the pMTG. Moreover, the connectivity results of pMTG with IPL tentatively suggest that early development of semantic representations may be facilitated by enhanced engagement of phonological short-term memory. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,include,10.1,11,both age groups are in the range -> use conjunction across groups,visual word–word relatedness judgment,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

However, previous studies have also reported category-specific dissociations of activation within this network. In this study, we investigated the development of category-specific activation in a WM task with digits, letters, and faces. Eight-year-old children and adults performed a 2-back WM task while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Overall, children were significantly slower and less accurate than adults on all three WM conditions (digits, letters, and faces); however, within each age group, behavioral performance across the three conditions was very similar. FMRI results revealed category-specific activation in adults but not children in the intraparietal sulcus for the digit condition. Likewise, during the letter condition, category-specific activation was observed in adults but not children in the left occipital-temporal cortex. In contrast, children and adults showed highly similar brain-activity patterns in the lateral fusiform gyri when solving the 2-back WM task with face stimuli. Our results suggest that 8-year-old children do not yet engage the typical brain regions that have been associated with abstract or semantic processing of numerical symbols and letters when these processes are task-irrelevant and the primary task is demanding. Nevertheless, brain activity in letter-responsive areas predicted children's spelling performance underscoring the relationship between abstract processing of letters and linguistic abilities.

Nineteen typically developing children between the age of five and seven performed visual word-level phonological (rhyming) and semantic (related meaning) judgment tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Our multivariate analysis showed that young children with good reading ability have already recruited the left hemispheric regions in the brain for phonological processing, including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), superior and middle temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. In addition, our multivariate results suggested that different sub-regions of the left IFG were recruited for the two tasks.

Changes in brain activation were also measured among 5th grade good readers at the same time points for comparison. The central finding was that prior to instruction, the poor readers had significantly less activation than good readers bilaterally in the parietal cortex. Immediately after instruction, poor readers made substantial gains in reading ability, and demonstrated significantly increased activation in the left angular gyrus and the left superior parietal lobule. Activation in these regions continued to increase among poor readers 1 year post-remediation, resulting in a normalization of the activation.

Most previous lexical-semantic functional MRI (fMRI) studies have been limited to single-word or word-pair tasks, outside a sentence context. Our objective was to investigate the development of lexical-semantic language networks in typically developing children using a more 'ecological' sentence-embedded semantic task that permitted performance monitoring while minimizing head movement by avoiding overt speech. Sixteen adults and 23 children completed two fMRI runs of an auditory lexical-semantic decision task with a button-press response, using reverse speech as control condition.

Greater activation in adults than in children was seen in left inferior parietal, premotor, and inferior frontal regions, and in bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA). Specifically for semantically incongruous sentences, adults also showed greater activation than children in left inferior frontal cortex, possibly related to enhanced 'top-down' control.

In-magnet task accuracy and response times were calculated, and fMRI data were evaluated for the effect of group on blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation, the correlation between task accuracy and activation and the functional connectivity between regions activating to task. Although there were differences in verbal IQ and CELF scores between the preterm (PT) and term control groups, there were no significant differences for either accuracy or response time for the in-magnet task. Both groups activated classic semantic processing areas including the left superior and middle temporal gyri and inferior frontal gyrus, and there was no significant difference in activation patterns between groups. Clear differences between the groups were observed in the correlation between task accuracy and activation to task at P < 0.01, corrected for multiple comparisons. Left inferior frontal gyrus correlated with accuracy only for term controls and left sensory motor areas correlated with accuracy only for PT subjects. Left middle temporal gyri correlated with task accuracy for both groups. Connectivity analyses at P < 0.001 revealed the importance of a circuit between left middle temporal gyri and inferior frontal gyrus for both groups.

We conclude that at 12 years of age, children born prematurely and children born at term had no difference in performance on a simple lexical semantic processing task and activated similar areas.

We investigated a crucial, previously unaddressed, question about how this organization emerges developmentally. We contrasted the developmental trajectories for face-, object-, and place-selective activation in the ventral visual cortex in children, adolescents, and adults. Although children demonstrated adult-like organization in object- and place-related cortex, as a group they failed to show consistent face-selective activation in classical face regions. The lack of a consistent neural signature for faces was attributable to (1) reduced face-selectivity and extent of activation within the regions that will become the FFA, OFA, and STS in adults, and (2) smaller volumes and considerable variability in the locus of face-selective activation in individual children. In contrast, adolescents showed an adult-like pattern of face-selective activation, although it was more right-lateralized. These findings reveal critical age-related differences in the emergence of category-specific functional organization in the visual cortex and support a model of brain development in which specialization emerges from interactions between experience-dependent learning and the maturing brain. © 2007 The Authors.

These regions perform phonemic analysis and conversion of written symbols to phonological units of speech (grapheme–to–phoneme conversion); two central cognitive processes that mediate reading acquisition. Furthermore, it has been assumed that, in contrast to cultural diversities, dyslexia in different languages has a universal biological origin. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging with reading-impaired Chinese children and associated controls, that functional disruption of the left middle frontal gyrus is associated with impaired reading of the Chinese language (a logographic rather than alphabetic writing system). Reading impairment in Chinese is manifested by two deficits: one relating to the conversion of graphic form (orthography) to syllable, and the other concerning orthography–to–semantics mapping. Both of these processes are critically mediated by the left middle frontal gyrus, which functions as a centre for fluent Chinese reading that coordinates and integrates various information about written characters in verbal and spatial working memory. This finding provides an insight into the fundamental pathophysiology of dyslexia by suggesting that rather than having a universal origin, the biological abnormality of impaired reading is dependent on culture. © 2004 Nature publishing group.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,include,11.1,12,NaN,visual lexical judgment on chinese characters (words vs. non-words),NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

However, the organization of semantic knowledge in youths with ASD remains unclear compared to typically developing (TD) youths. The present study addresses this issue by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the distinction between association strength and categorical relatedness of semantic knowledge. A sample of 31 male youths with ASD (mean age = 12.1 years, SD = 1.2) and 38 TD youths (mean age = 11.9 years, SD = 1.0) was recruited with matched age, gender, and handedness. Participants decided if two visually presented Chinese characters were semantically related during fMRI scanning. For weaker association strength, the ASD group showed greater left cuneus activation, which was positively correlated with the picture completion for visual perception, whereas the TD group showed greater middle temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus activation. For higher categorical relatedness, the TD group showed greater activation than the ASD group in the occipitotemporal cortex and left precuneus, which was positively correlated with the similarities for concept formulation. Findings imply that the ASD group may use lower-level visual information for both association strength and categorical relatedness.

We found that readers who are responsive to intervention have more typical pre-intervention functional interactions between executive and reading systems compared to nonresponsive readers.

Comparison of activation patterns between dyslexic and control subjects revealed distinct and significant differences in cerebral and cerebellar activation. Control subjects showed bilaterally well-defined and focal activation patterns in the frontal and parietal lobes and the posterior regions of the cerebellar hemispheres.

All literate adults possess a region specialized for letter strings, the visual word form area (VWFA), within the mosaic of ventral regions involved in processing other visual categories such as objects, places, faces, or body parts. Therefore, the acquisition of literacy may induce a reorientation of cortical maps towards letters at the expense of other categories such as faces. To test this cortical recycling hypothesis, we studied how the visual cortex of individual children changes during the first months of reading acquisition. Ten 6-year-old children were scanned longitudinally 6 or 7 times with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and throughout the first year of school. Subjects were exposed to a variety of pictures (words, numbers, tools, houses, faces, and bodies) while performing an unrelated target-detection task. Behavioral assessment indicated a sharp rise in grapheme–phoneme knowledge and reading speed in the first trimester of school. Concurrently, voxels specific to written words and digits emerged at the VWFA location. The responses to other categories remained largely stable, although right-hemispheric face-related activity increased in proportion to reading scores. Retrospective examination of the VWFA voxels prior to reading acquisition showed that reading encroaches on voxels that are initially weakly specialized for tools and close to but distinct from those responsive to faces. Remarkably, those voxels appear to keep their initial category selectivity while acquiring an additional and stronger responsivity to words.

In addition, we related a cognitive skill that improved substantially from age 6 to 10, namely the ability to recognize tools from unusual viewpoints, to the development of cortical object processing. In multiple complementary analyses we showed that those children who were better at recognizing tools from unusual viewpoints outside the scanner showed a reduced cortical response to tools and animals when viewed inside the scanner, bilaterally in intraparietal and inferotemporal cortex. In contrast, the cortical preference for tools in the dorsal and ventral visual stream did not predict object recognition performance, and was organized in an adult-like manner at six. While cortical tool preference did not change with age, the findings suggest that animal-preferring regions in the ventral visual stream may develop later, concordant with previous reports of a protracted development in similar regions for faces. We thus conclude that intraparietal and inferotemporal cortical networks that support aspects of object processing irrespective of tool or animal category, continue to develop during the school-age years and contribute to the development of object recognition skills during this period. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,contacted,6.9,7,NaN,viewing tools + objects vs. scrambled images and tools vs. animals,Dr Tessa Dekker,t.dekker@ucl.ac.uk ,31/08/2020,received

Experience with subordinate- and individual-level classification of faces is thought, by some, to be foundational in the development of the specialization of face recognition. Studying children with extremely intense interests (EII) provides an opportunity to examine experience-related changes in non-face object recognition in a population where face expertise is not fully developed. Here, two groups of school-aged children -one group with an EII with Pokémon cards and another group of age-matched controls - underwent fMRI while viewing faces, Pokémon characters, Pokémon objects, and Digimon characters. Pokémon objects were non-character Pokémon cards that experts do not typically individuate during game play and trading. Neither experts nor controls had previous experience with Digimon characters. As expected, experts and controls showed equivalent activation in the fusiform face area (FFA) with face stimuli. As predicted by the expertise hypothesis, experts showed greater activation than controls with Pokémon characters, and showed greater activation with Pokémon characters than Pokémon objects. Experts and controls showed equivalent activation with Digimon characters. However, heightened activation with Digimon characters in both groups suggested that there are other strong influences on the activation of the FFA beyond stimulus characteristics, experience, and classification level. By demonstrating the important role of expertise, the findings are inconsistent with a purely face-specific account of FFA function.

Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and tasks that required attention to scene (or face) images and suppression of face (or scene) images, respectively, to investigate task-dependent modulation of activity in the RSC and whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) of this area in 7–11-year-old children and young adults. We compared responsiveness of the RSC with that of the PPA. The RSC was selectively activated by scene images in both groups, albeit less than the PPA. Children modulated activity between the tasks similarly in the RSC and PPA, and to the same extent as adults in PPA, whereas adults modulated activity in the RSC less than in PPA. In children, the whole brain FC of the RSC was stronger in the Sf than Fs task between the left RSC and right fusiform gyrus. The between groups comparison suggested stronger FC in children than adults in the Sf task between the right RSC and the left inferior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus.

The present study examined developmental changes in face network functional connectivity in children (5-12. years) and adults (18-43. years) during face-viewing using a graph-theory approach. A face-specific developmental change involved connectivity of the right occipital face area. During childhood, this node increased in strength and within-module clustering based on positive connectivity. These changes reflect an important role of the ROFA in segregation of function during childhood. In addition, strength and diversity of connections within a module that included primary visual areas (left and right calcarine) and limbic regions (left hippocampus and right inferior orbitofrontal cortex) increased from childhood to adulthood, reflecting increased visuo-limbic integration. This integration was pronounced for faces but also emerged for natural objects. Taken together, the primary face-specific developmental changes involved segregation of a posterior visual module during childhood, possibly implicated in early stage perceptual face processing, and greater integration of visuo-limbic connections from childhood to adulthood, which may reflect processing related to development of perceptual expertise for individuation of faces and other visually homogenous categories. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,contacted,ask,12,NaN,viewing faces vs. objects,"Jane E.

We manipulated association strength (i.e. a global reading unit) and semantic radical (i.e. a local reading unit) to explore the interaction of lexical and sublexical semantic information in making semantic judgments. In the semantic judgment task, two types of stimuli were used: visually-similar (i.e. shared a semantic radical) versus visually-dissimilar (i.e. did not share a semantic radical) character pairs. Participants were asked to indicate if two Chinese characters, arranged according to association strength, were related in meaning. The results showed greater developmental increases in activation in left angular gyrus (BA 39) in the visually-similar compared to the visually-dissimilar pairs for the strong association. There were also greater age-related increases in angular gyrus for the strong compared to weak association in the visually-similar pairs.

Compared to those of adults, children's semantic networks are less accessible and less established, a difference that is also thought to contribute to children's relative resistance to semantically related false alarms. Using the "" congruency effect"" - the memory advantage of congruity, we manipulated the encoded stimuli in the present experiment such that the use of the knowledge base at encoding was more - or less - accessible in both children and adults. While being scanned, 15 children (ages 8-11) and 18 young adults saw printed noun/color combinations and were asked to indicate whether each combination existed in nature. A subsequent recognition test was administered outside of the scanner. Behaviorally, although overall memory was higher in the adult group compared to the children, both age groups showed the congruency effect to the same extent. A comparison of the neural substrates supporting the congruency effect between adults and children revealed that whereas adults recruited regions primarily associated with semantic-conceptual processing (e.g., the left PFC and parietal and occipito-temporal cortices), children recruited regions earlier in the processing stream (e.g., the right occipital cortex). This evidence supports the hypothesis that early in development, episodic encoding depends more on perceptual systems, whereas top-down frontal control and parietal structures become more prominent in the encoding process with age.

We find that children have a smaller PPA and OPA than adults, while the size of RSC does not differ. Furthermore, selectivity for scenes in the PPA and the OPA, but not in the RSC, increases with age. This increase seems to be driven by both increasing responses to preferred stimuli and decreasing responses to non-preferred stimuli.

Its reproducible location across scripts suggests important anatomical constraints, such as specific patterns of connectivity, notably to spoken language areas. Here, we explored the structural connectivity of the emerging VWFA in terms of its specificity relative to other ventral visual regions and its stability throughout the process of reading instruction in ten children studied longitudinally over 2 years. Category-specific regions for words, houses, faces, and tools were identified in the left vOTC of each subject with functional MRI. With diffusion MRI and tractography, we reconstructed the connections of these regions at two time points (mean age ± standard deviation: 6.2 ± 0.3, 7.2 ± 0.4 years). We first showed that the regions for each visual category harbor their own specific connectivity, all of which precede reading instruction and remain stable throughout development. The most specific connections of the VWFA were to the dorsal posterior parietal cortex. We then showed that microstructural changes in these connections correlated with improvements in reading scores over the first year of instruction but not 1 year later in a subsample of eight children (age: 8.4 ± 0.3 years). These results suggest that the VWFA location depends on its connectivity to distant regions, in particular, the left inferior parietal region which may play a crucial role in visual field maps and eye movement dynamics in addition to attentional control in letter-by-letter reading and disambiguation of mirror-letters during the first stages of learning to read. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,contacted,6.2,7,NaN,viewing houses vs. faces vs. words vs. tools,Prof Eric Moulton,eric.moulton.jr@gmail.com,31/08/2020,sent

Sentence reading is also impaired in dyslexic readers, but whether semantic processing deficits contribute is unclear. Combining spatially and temporally sensitive neuroimaging techniques to focus on semantic processing can provide a more comprehensive characterization of sentence reading in dyslexia. We recorded brain activity from 52 children (16 with dyslexia, 31 controls) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERP) in two separate counterbalanced sessions. The children silently read and occasionally judged simple sentences with semantically congruous or incongruous endings. fMRI and ERP activation during sentence reading and semantic processing was analyzed across all children and also by comparing children with dyslexia to controls. For sentence reading, we analyzed the response to all words in a sentence; for semantic processing, we contrasted responses to incongruous and congruous endings. Sentence reading was characterized by activation in a left-lateralized language network. Semantic processing was characterized by activation in left-hemispheric regions of the inferior frontal and superior temporal cortex and by an electrophysiological N400 effect after 240 ms with consistent left anterior source localization. Children with dyslexia showed decreased activation for sentence reading in inferior parietal and frontal regions, and for semantic processing in inferior parietal regions, and during the N400 effect. Together, this suggests that semantic impairment during sentence reading reduces dyslexic children's response in left anterior brain regions underlying the more phasic N400 effect and subsequently modulates the more sustained BOLD response in left inferior parietal regions. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Adding a younger control group at a similar reading level (RL) as the dyslexic group, we examined here which of these markers would be specific for dyslexia despite matched performance, and which would resemble a developmental delay. Both the RL group and the DYS group showed a similar reversal of incongruency effects in the inferior parietal region (fMRI data) and similarly reduced incongruency effects around 400 ms (ERP data) compared to the CA group, suggesting that the semantic impairment in dyslexia resembles a developmental delay. Furthermore, the DYS group showed reduced sentence reading-related activation in the inferior parietal cortex in the fMRI data, and at around 100 ms (trend) and 400 ms in the ERP data when compared to both CA and RL groups, suggesting dyslexia-specific deficits in basic word processing during sentence reading.

During the acquisition of event-related fMRI data, children aged 6-13 (N = 16) and young adults (N = 17) performed a task in which they were asked to identify semantic relationships between drawings of common objects. On semantic problems, participants indicated which of five objects was most closely semantically related to a cued object. On analogy problems, participants solved a visual propositional analogy (e.g., shoe is to foot as glove is to...?) by indicating which of four objects would complete the problem; these problems required integration of two semantic relations, or relational integration. Our prior research on analogical reasoning in adults implicated left anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in the controlled retrieval of individual semantic relationships, and rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) in relational integration. In this study, age-related changes in the recruitment of VLPFC, temporal cortex, and other cortical regions were observed during the retrieval of individual semantic relations. In contrast, age-related changes in RLPFC function were observed during relational integration. Children aged 6-13 engage RLPFC too late in the analogy trials to influence their behavioral responses, suggesting that important changes in RLPFC function take place during adolescence.

This discrepancy has been supported by recent neuroimaging studies showing abnormal activity in RD during semantic processing in the visual but not in the auditory modality. Whether effective connectivity between brain regions in RD could also show this pattern of discrepancy has not been investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings: Children (8- to 14-year-olds) were given a semantic task in the visual and auditory modality that required an association judgment as to whether two sequentially presented words were associated. Effective connectivity was investigated using Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) was used separately for each modality to find a winning family of DCM models separately for typically developing (TD) and RD children. BMS yielded the same winning family with modulatory effects on bottom-up connections from the input regions to middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) with inconclusive evidence regarding top-down modulations. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was thus conducted across models in this winning family and compared across groups. The bottom-up effect from the fusiform gyrus (FG) to MTG rather than the top-down effect from IFG to MTG was stronger in TD compared to RD for the visual modality. The stronger bottom-up influence in TD was only evident for related word pairs but not for unrelated pairs. No group differences were noted in the auditory modality. Conclusions/Significance: This study revealed a modality-specific deficit for children with RD in bottom-up effective connectivity from orthographic to semantic processing regions. There were no group differences in connectivity from frontal regions, suggesting that the core deficit in RD is not in top-down modulation. © 2010 Liu et al.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,duplicate,10.6,14,re-analysis of booth2007,auditory and visual word–word relatedness judgment,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Revealing differences between children's large-scale functional brain networks for reading tasks and those of adults helps us to understand how the functional network changes over reading development. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 17 adults (19–28 years old) and 16 children (11–13 years old), and graph theoretical analyses to investigate age-related changes in large-scale functional networks during rhyming and meaning judgment tasks on pairs of visually presented Chinese characters. We found that: (1) adults had stronger inter-regional connectivity and nodal degree in occipital regions, while children had stronger inter-regional connectivity in temporal regions, suggesting that adults rely more on visual orthographic processing whereas children rely more on auditory phonological processing during reading. (2) Only adults showed between-task differences in inter-regional connectivity and nodal degree, whereas children showed no task differences, suggesting the topological organization of adults’ reading network is more specialized. (3) Children showed greater inter-regional connectivity and nodal degree than adults in multiple subcortical regions; the hubs in children were more distributed in subcortical regions while the hubs in adults were more distributed in cortical regions. These findings suggest that reading development is manifested by a shift from reliance on subcortical to cortical regions. Taken together, our study suggests that Chinese reading development is supported by developmental changes in brain connectivity properties, and some of these changes may be domain-general while others may be specific to the reading domain. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,duplicate,11.7,13,re-analysis of liu2012,visual word–word relatedness judgment,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

FMRI has revealed consistent overlapping networks in word and passage reading, as well as unique regions for DL processing; however, less is known about how WL and DL processes interact. Here we examined functional connectivity from seed regions derived from where BOLD signal overlapped during word and passage reading in 38 adolescents ranging in reading ability, hypothesizing that even though certain regions support word‐ and higher‐level language, connectivity patterns from overlapping regions would be task modulated. Results indeed revealed that the left‐lateralized semantic and working memory (WM) seed regions showed task‐dependent functional connectivity patterns: during DL processes, semantic and WM nodes all correlated with the left angular gyrus, a region implicated in semantic memory/coherence building. In contrast, during WL, these nodes coordinated with a traditional WL area (left occipitotemporal region). In addition, these WL and DL findings were modulated by decoding and comprehension abilities, respectively, with poorer abilities correlating with decreased connectivity. Findings indicate that key regions may uniquely contribute to multiple levels of reading; we speculate that these connectivity patterns may be especially salient for reading outcomes and intervention response.

Only 52 patients with AG have been reported so far, making it one of the rarest neuropathological entities. Hereby we present two new cases of AG in young subjects with detailed neuropathological investigations and a neuroradiological picture along with a brief summary of all already published literature reports of this tumor. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue from both cases revealed similar changes characteristic of AG. The tumors were composed of spindle-like, elongated cells, forming characteristic pseudorosettes around vessels and diffusively infiltrating surrounding tissue, trapping neurons between tumor cells. Noticeably, some neoplastic cells encrusting vessels extended far beyond the main tumor mass. Hypothetically, this may be responsible for the recurrence of the tumor even in the case of apparently total excision. In immunohistochemistry, AG cells were glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin positive, also exhibiting a strikingly significant epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) dot-like staining pattern. In one of the cases, electron microscopy revealed ependymal differentiation features such as microvilli and cilia. Taken together, all these data strongly confirm a dual astroglial-ependymal nature of the tumor. Follow up corroborates benign character of this neoplasm. Both AGs reported here were immunonegative for the product of the mutated IDH-1 gene what, according to our best knowledge, has never been reported so far. It may suggest that in their pathogenesis AGs differ from grade II astrocytomas, which in most cases harbor a mutation of IDH-1. Noteworthy, neuroimaging in our cases was relatively characteristic but not conclusive, therefore biopsy (at least) is mandatory.

This makes it truly interdisciplinary, involving, for example, neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, speech pathology and biology. It also involves the use of a multitude of research methods, such as experimental research, neuroimaging, simulation of brain processes and video recording of spoken interaction. Traditionally, the study of people with brain damage, especially acquired brain damage, which causes a language disorder, has dominated the field. Neurolinguistics can, however, also be about how the brain and human language and communication developed during evolution and how they develop in children and adults; it can also be about making computer simulations of linguistic processing by the brain; and it can be about localizing activity in parts of the brain involved in language processing by using neuroimaging methods. Neurolinguists can be focused on any of these aspects or on combinations of them. This overview will begin with some of the historical developments of neurolinguistics; it will then give examples of how research in different areas of neurolinguistics is pursued. Methods in neurolinguistics will be described and research dealing with different aspects of linguistics - phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, multilingualism and reading and writing processes - will be presented.

Methods: Subjects were 38 epileptic patients with seizure onset before 3 months of age. We investigated the age of seizure onset, seizure types, myoclonus, EEG features, neuroimaging studies, outcome of seizures and development. We performed multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to reveal associations among these characteristics and to find important characteristics to divide this epilepsy group into subgroups. Results: Very early onset epilepsies were characterized by partial seizures and epileptic spasms, especially occurring in combination as a single ictal event (combined seizures), and poor outcome. Suppression-burst (SB), hypsarrhythmia, EEG asymmetry and structural brain abnormalities were common. MCA demonstrated that presence or absence of SB was the most meaningful factor to separate this group into subgroups. MCA on the subgroup with SB revealed a subset with early-onset spasms, partial seizures with single focus, no myoclonus, SB during wakefulness and sleep, no EEG asynchrony, hypsarrhythmia and combined seizures, and another subset with late-onset spasms, partial seizures with multiple foci, myoclonus, EEG asynchrony, no combined seizures, SB during sleep only, no EEG asymmetry, no structural abnormality and no hypsarrhythmia. These corresponded to Ohtahara syndrome and early myoclonic encephalopathy, respectively.

Methods: Retrospective review of clinical features, course, and outcome. Neuroimaging was analyzed for infarct pattern, cerebrovascular diagnosis (anatomic/Childhood Arterial Ischemic Stroke Standardized Classification and Diagnostic Evaluation [CASCADE] criteria), and disease progression. Results: In the 31 children (median age, 18 months), presentations included acute hemiparesis (n 23) and focal seizures (n 12). Seven had systemic arterial disease; 13 had cardiac abnormalities. Twenty had recurrent AIS or transient ischemic attack (after median of 3 months); 16 had >1 recurrence. Median modified Rankin Scale score was 3, with motor impairments in 20, cognitive impairments in 11, and seizures in 7. At presentation, 17 had old and acute infarcts. Twenty-five had high signal in white matter. A total of 13/23 reimaged patients accrued further infarcts over a median of 39 months. Arteriopathy involved the carotid circulation bilaterally in all; 6 had posterior circulation and 11 had extracranial involvement. Arteriopathy distribution was symmetric in 24/31.

Conclusion: Young children with bilateral cerebral arteriopathies (particularly meeting criteria for CASCADE 3A) have a malignant course, with frequent recurrent events, progressive disease, and poor outcomes.

Improvements in preterm birth and survival rates translate to increasing numbers of preterm survivors, and many develop motor, cognitive and sensory impairments. RECENT FINDINGS: The review discusses the recently reported prevalence of neurodevelopmental disabilities in preterm survivors, in addition to studies of factors associated with neurodevelopmental outcome. SUMMARY: A 2007 report from the Institute of Medicine emphasizes preterm birth as an increasingly common complex condition with multiple risk factors resulting from multiple gene-environmental interactions, leading to birth before 37 weeks gestation, neonatal complications and a disproportionately high contribution to neurodevelopmental disability rates. The increased risk of cerebral palsy with decreasing gestational age categories is well documented, but recent studies highlight the range and severity of cognitive, sensory, language, visual-perceptual, attention and learning deficits in very preterm children. Combined with increasingly sophisticated neuroimaging studies to identify perinatal risk factors, neurodevelopmental follow-up of neonatal intensive care unit trials offers the potential to really improve our understanding of how the preterm brain develops, is injured and recovers from injuries.

These crosslinguistic differences raise important questions for language development in terms of how this variation is learned by children. We investigated how Turkish-, English-, and Japanese-speaking children (mean age 3;8) package the semantic elements of Manner and Path onto syntactic units when both the Manner and the Path of the moving Figure occur simultaneously and are salient in the event depicted. Both universal and language-specific patterns were evident in our data. Children used the semantic-syntactic mappings preferred by adult speakers of their own languages, and even expressed subtle syntactic differences that encode different relations between Manner and Path in the same way as their adult counterparts (i.e., Manner causing vs. incidental to Path). However, not all types of semantics-syntax mappings were easy for children to learn (e.g., expressing Manner and Path elements in two verbal clauses). In such cases, Turkish- and Japanese-speaking children frequently used syntactic patterns that were not typical in the target language but were similar to patterns used by English-speaking children, suggesting some universal influence. Thus, both language-specific and universal tendencies guide the development of complex spatial expressions.

Methods A total of 1,085 children born at <28 weeks' gestation had clinically indicated retinal examinations and had a developmental assessment at 2 years corrected age. Relationships between ROP categories and brain abnormalities were explored using logistic regression models with adjustment for potential confounders. Results The 173 children who had severe ROP, defined as prethreshold ROP (n = 146) or worse (n = 27) were somewhat more likely than their peers without ROP to have brain ultrasound lesions or cerebral palsy. They were approximately twice as likely to have very low Bayley Scales scores. After adjusting for risk factors common to both ROP and brain disorders, infants who developed severe ROP were at increased risk of low Bayley Scales only. Among children with prethreshold ROP, exposure to anesthesia was not associated with low Bayley Scales. Conclusions Some but not all of the association of ROP with brain disorders can be explained by common risk factors. Most of the increased risks of very low Bayley Scales associated with ROP are probably not a consequence of exposure to anesthetic agents.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the hypothesis that brain dysconnectivity is a transdiagnostic phenotype in adolescence with increased susceptibility and symptoms of psychiatric disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We investigated clinical symptoms aswell as cognitive function in 6487 individuals aged 8 to 21 years from November 1, 2009, to November 30, 2011, in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and analyzed diffusion magnetic resonance imaging brain scans for 748 of the participants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Independent component analysiswas used to derive dimensional psychopathology scores, and genome-wide complex trait analysis was used to estimate its heritability. Multimodal fusion simultaneously modeled contributions of the diffusion magnetic resonance imagingmetrics fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, L1 (the principal diffusion tensor imaging eigen value), mode of anisotropy, as well as dominant and secondary fiber orientations, and structural connectivity density, and their association with general psychopathology and cognition.RESULTS Machine learning with 10-fold cross-validation and permutation testing in 729 individuals (aged 8 to 22 years; mean [SD] age, 15.1 [3.3] years; 343 females [46%]) revealed significant association with general psychopathology levels (r = 0.24, P < .001) and cognition (r = 0.39, P < .001). A brain white matter pattern reflecting frontotemporal connectivity and crossing fibers in the uncinate fasciculus was the most associated feature for both traits.

Across the domains of (1) word meanings, (2) morphologically inflected words, (3) n-grams, (4) sentence-level constructions and (5) phonetics and phonology, accounts based on independently-represented abstractions (whether formal rules or prototype categories) fail for two reasons. First, it is not possible to posit abstractions that delineate possible and impossible form; e.g. that (1) rule in pool tables and data tables, but rule out chairs, (2) rule in the past-tense forms netted and bet but rule out *setted and *jet, (3) rule in the bigram f+t but rule out (probabilistically) v+t, (4) rule in both John feared Bill and John frightened Bill but rule out *John laughed Bill, (5) rule in Speaker A but rule out Speaker B as the person who produced a particular word (e.g. Sa’urday). Second, for each domain, empirical data provide evidence of exemplar storage that cannot be captured by putative abstractions: e.g. speakers prefer and/or show an advantage for (1) exemplar variation even within word-meaning ‘category boundaries’, (2) novel inflected forms that are similar to existing exemplars, (3) n-grams that have occurred frequently in the input, (4) SVO sentences with he as SUBJECT and it as OBJECT and (5) repeated productions of ‘the same’ word that are phonologically similar or, better still, identical. An exemplar account avoids an intractable lumping-or-splitting dilemma facing abstraction-based accounts and provides a unitary explanation of language acquisition across all domains; one that is consistent with models and empirical findings from the computational modelling and neuroimaging literature. © The Author(s) 2019.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Previous research has revealed distinctive cognitive deficits, including impaired face processing. However, the neuro-functional substrates underlying these deficits have not been explored. Our aim was to investigate facial and emotional processing in 22q11DS. Methods: During event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, 15 individuals with 22q11DS were compared with age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects on a simple visual categorization task (faces or houses). Each stimulus was presented twice, and faces had either neutral or emotional (fearful) expressions. Results: Abnormal responses to faces were observed in 22q11DS, including a lack of normal face-selectivity in fusiform gyrus. By contrast, responses to houses were comparable across groups, with preserved selectivity in parahippocampal gyrus. Results also revealed a repetition-suppression effect for fearful faces in the right amygdala, which arose in healthy control subjects only, suggesting a lack of amygdala modulation by fear expression in 22q11DS. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate selective anomalies in several brain regions critically implicated in visual and social function in 22q11DS. These findings suggest important new avenues for studying emotional processing and social deficits frequently observed in psychotic patients and establishing their relation to specific phenotypic manifestations in 22q11DS. © 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,15,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In particular, we focus on a moderate formulation of this viewpoint, the sensory/motor model of semantic representations of objects (e.g., Gainotti 2007; Martin 2007), which has been examined utilizing behavioral, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological evidence.

Preoperatively, 36 of the 99 were diagnosed as being neurologically intact while the remainder had various neurological sequelae including reflex change, sensory disturbance, muscle weakness, and sphincter disorder. Preoperative neuroimaging permitted classifying lumbosacral lipomas into 5 categories: (1) dorsal, (2) caudal, (3) combined, (4) filar types, and (5) lipomyelomeningocele. Although all 99 patients underwent untethering of the spinal cord, some lipomas remained untouched upon completion of surgery to avoid risks of injury to nervous tissues with respect to combined type lipomas and lipomyelomeningoceles. The lipoma could, on the other hand, be removed either subtotally or completely to untether the spinal cord in cases of caudal and filar type lipomas, and most dorsal type lipomas. In a mean postoperative follow-up period of 8.49 years, there was no significant deterioration among most patients, and some patients even demonstrated improved function. Four patients, however, developed bladder function deterioration postoperatively, 3 of them in a late-onset manner although unethering surgery successfully had been accomplished at between 3 and 4 months after birth. Our results indicated untethering surgery possibly could prevent neurological function deteriorating with advancing age in most patients with lumbosacral lipomas, but not for some patients even though the spinal cord was untethered during the early post-birth period.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Electroencephalography (EEG) shows characteristic generalized epileptic activity  that is similar in those with lesional, genetic, or unknown causes, suggesting a  common underlying mechanism. The condition typically begins in young children,  leaving many severely disabled with recurring seizures throughout their adult life.  Scalp EEG of the tonic seizures of LGS is characterized by a diffuse high-voltage  slow transient evolving into generalized low-voltage fast activity, likely  reflecting sustained fast neuronal firing over a wide cortical area. The typical  interictal discharges (runs of slow spike-and-wave and bursts of generalized  paroxysmal fast activity) also have a ""generalized"" electrical field, suggesting  widespread cortical involvement. Recent brain mapping studies have begun to reveal  which cortical and subcortical regions are active during these ""generalized""  discharges. In this critical review, we examine findings from neuroimaging studies  of LGS and place these in the context of the electrical and clinical features of the  syndrome. We suggest that LGS can be conceptualized as ""secondary network epilepsy,""  where the epileptic activity is expressed through large-scale brain networks,  particularly the attention and default-mode networks. Cortical lesions, when  present, appear to chronically interact with these networks to produce network  instability rather than triggering each individual epileptic discharge. LGS can be  considered as ""secondary"" network epilepsy because the epileptic manifestations of  the disorder reflect the networks being driven, rather than the specific initiating  process. In this review, we begin with a summation of the clinical manifestations of  LGS and what this has revealed about the underlying etiology of the condition. We  then undertake a systematic review of the functional neuroimaging literature in LGS,  which leads us to conclude that LGS can best be conceptualized as ""secondary network  epilepsy.""",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

It still remains to be adequately answered whether these increases are true or an artefact of changes in diagnostic and registration practices. Using high-quality national cancer registration data, we have analysed incidence trends for each major histological subgroup of CNS tumour (2000 World Health Organisation (WHO) classification) registered in those aged 0-84 years for the whole of England during the period 1979 through 2003. 134,509 primary CNS tumours of malignant, benign and uncertain behaviour located in the brain, meninges, spinal cord, cranial nerves, other parts of the central nervous system and in the pituitary and pineal glands were registered. In summary, we present the single largest nationwide study on the longitudinal incidence trends of CNS tumours. The increase in incidence observed in the 1970s and 1980s was mainly in the young and the elderly and has now plateaued and may even be decreasing. There is however variation in trends by histology. The incidence of some histological sub-groups has continued to increase until the most recent period of analysis. Much of the initial increase can be attributed to the emergence of much more widely available neuroimaging, while the most recent incidence changes for specific sub-groups of CNS tumours appear to be due to greater diagnostic specificity leading to a shift in registered categories. However, the trends for high-grade astrocytomas and other gliomas need further observation and investigation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Our purpose is to provide an outline of the investigative modalities that support the clinical suspicion and have been found to be useful in the diagnosis. Five clinical groups were studied including 5 exercise intolerances (2 with inflammatory myopathy), 3 with myopathies (1 with dilated cardiomyopathy), 2 with progressive external oftalmoplegia (1 associated with cerebellar ataxia + epilepsy + hypertrophic cardiomyopathy + pes cavus), 4 with encephalopathies (3 with myoclonic encephalopathies with ataxia and dementia and 1 with epilepsy and tremor), and 1 with metabolic acidosis and cardiomyopathy. We used the following categories of investigative procedures: clinical phenotype analysis including pedigree study, neurophysiological tests, bicycle ergometric evaluation, neuroimaging, microscopic study of skeletal muscle biopsy, post-mortem examination, biochemical assays and molecular genetic studies. EMG showed myopathic changes in 5 cases, features of neuropathy in 2, mixed myopathic and neuropathic pattern in 1 and nonspecific changes in 3. EMG was normal in 3 patients. The most common skeletal muscle abnormalities were variation in fiber size (60%), lipid inclusions (33.3%), oxidative subsarcolemmal aggregates (26.7%) and ragged-red fibers (26,7%). Electron microscopy revealed mitochondrial abnormalities in 8 out of 14 patients' muscle biopsies, and in myocardic and hepatic tissues of another.

Complex 1 defect in 6, complexes I + IV deficiencies in 3, complex II defect in 1, complex IV deficiency in 1, complexes II + IV deficiencies in 1, and complex III defect in 1. In 2 patients the biochemical defect was not located. Mitochondrial DNA alterations were not found in 7 investigated patients. The clinical spectrum of MD has become increasingly wider.

"Asakawa, S.",2014,databases,Semantics with or without categorization,Horizons in Neurosci. Res.,NaN,"In spite of drastically increasing neuroimaging data, how semantic memory is organized has been a topic of controversy for decades. There still are contradictions shown by children in conceptual development and among symptoms shown by patients with category-specific semantic memory disorders. Several hypotheses have been proposed by cognitive- and neuro-psychologists based on empirical data and their models for semantic memory derived from this evidence. Therefore, it might be worth clarifying disagreements among them. We compared the differences between two major contentions about semantic categorization. One is WITH and the other is WITHOUT categorization hypotheses (Rogers and McClelland, 2011). Two hypotheses, marginalization operation and tree structures expressed in the anterior temporal lobes, were proposed as alternatives. Furthermore, essential problems in modeling semantic memory and categorization were discussed. They were (1) dimensionality of representation, (2) roles of intermediate layers, and (3) computational limitations of error-driven learning algorithms. According to these frameworks, considering that bothWITH and WITHOUT categorization hypotheses could be similar might be possible. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The authors investigated WM development in healthy adolescent males through age-associated changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), radial (λ⊥) and axial (λ||) diffusivity. Methods: Twenty-four healthy adolescent males (mean age = 16.6, SD = 2.5 years) were divided into two groups with an age split of 16.9 years and underwent a whole-brain voxelwise analysis. Results: At a threshold of p &lt; 0.001 and extent threshold of 100 contiguous voxels, several clusters with increased FA and axial diffusivity and no differences in radial diffusivity were observed in older adolescents compared to the younger adolescents in the left arcuate fasciculus, bilateral posterior internal capsule/thalamic radiation, bilateral prefrontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, and posterior corpus callosum. Increased FA and λ|| of several clusters along the arcuate fasciculus significantly correlated with a test of language and semantic memory. Conclusions: These results suggest ongoing maturational changes especially in the arcuate fasiculus during late adolescence. Increased FA and λ|| with no changes in radial diffusivity may reflect a developmental pattern of reduced tortuousity toward more straightened fibers and/or increased axonal fiber organization during late adolescence. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

CT was initially used to determine whether a child had an intracranial injury (ICI) that required neurosurgical management. Subsequently, CT helped determine whether a child could safely be discharged from the emergency department or required hospitalization for continued observation as well as to assess a risk of long-term deficits. This application of CT technology led to an increasing number of scans, questions about their cost effectiveness,and development of decision rules (i.e., tools designed to help clinicians make bedside diagnostic and therapeutic decisions) to increase the diagnostic yield for ICI, although no consensus has been reached as to which set(s) of rules is optimal. In this chapter, we review recent data regarding the yield of CT, particularly related to clinical decision rules for ordering a scan. We also review the limited data regarding the use of MRI in cases of pediatric mTBI, in particular, advanced imaging sequences such as diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), MR spectroscopy,and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). We conclude the chapter with a discussion of the roles of CT and MRI in helping to define subcategories of mTBI within the context of a proposed imaging algorithm.

Presently, there are no existing guidelines for management of these children in Scandinavia. The purpose of this study was to produce new evidence-based guidelines for the initial management of head trauma in the paediatric population in Scandinavia. The primary aim was to detect all children in need of neurosurgical intervention. Detection of any traumatic intracranial injury on CT scan was an important secondary aim. Methods: General methodology according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used. Systematic evidence-based review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology and based upon relevant clinical questions with respect to patient-important outcomes. Quality ratings of the included studies were performed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 and Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM)-2 tools. Based upon the results, GRADE recommendations, a guideline, discharge instructions and in-hospital observation instructions were drafted. For elements with low evidence, a modified Delphi process was used for consensus, which included relevant clinical stakeholders. Results: The guidelines include criteria for selecting children for CT scans, in-hospital observation or early discharge, and suggestions for monitoring routines and discharge advice for children and guardians. The guidelines separate mild head trauma patients into high-, medium- and low-risk categories, favouring observation for mild, low-risk patients as an attempt to reduce CT scans in children. Conclusions: We present new evidence and consensus based Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children.

Ten children with dyslexia and 11 normal readers performed these tasks during fMRI scanning. Children with dyslexia then completed 28 hours of comprehensive reading instruction. Scans were repeated on both dyslexic and control subjects using the same tasks. Results indicate that before treatment, children with dyslexia showed less activation than controls in left middle and inferior frontal gyri, right superior frontal gyrus, left middle and inferior temporal gyri, and bilateral superior parietal regions for phoneme mapping. Activation was significantly reduced for children with dyslexia on the initial morpheme mapping scan in left middle frontal gyrus, right superior parietal, and fusiform/occipital region. Treatment was associated with improved reading scores and increased brain activation during both tasks. These results suggest that behavioral gains from comprehensive reading instruction are associated with changes in brain function during performance of language tasks.

Currently, BIG have been successfully applied to adult populations, but the value of implementing these guidelines among pediatric patients remains unassessed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the established BIG (BIG-1 category) for managing pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) without NC (no-NC). METHODS We prospectively implemented the BIG-1 category (normal neurologic examination, ICH ≤ 4 mm limited to one location, no skull fracture) to identify pediatric TBI patients (age, ≤ 21 years) that were to be managed no-NC. Propensity score matching was performed to match these no-NC patients to a similar cohort of patients managed with NC before the implementation of BIG in a 1:1 ratio for demographics, severity of injury, and type as well as size of ICH. Our primary outcome measure was need for neurosurgical intervention. RESULTS A total of 405 pediatric TBI patients were enrolled, of which 160 (NC, 80; no-NC, 80) were propensity score matched. The mean age was 9.03 ± 7.47 years, 62.1% (n = 85) were male, the median Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 (13-15), and the median head Abbreviated Injury Scale score was 2 (2-3). A subanalysis based on stratifying patients by age groups showed a decreased in the use of repeat head CT (p = 0.02) in the no-NC group, with no difference in progression (p = 0.34) and the need for neurosurgical intervention (p = 0.9) compared with the NC group. CONCLUSION The BIG can be safely and effectively implemented in pediatric TBI patients. Reducing repeat head CT in pediatric patients has long-term sequelae. Likewise, adhering to the guidelines helps in reducing radiation exposure across all age groups. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic/care management, level III. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods: A planned secondary analysis of a prospective multicentre cohort study was conducted in 10 EDs in Australia and New Zealand, including children aged <18 years with HIs. Epidemiology codes were used to prospectively code the injuries. Demographic and clinical information including the rate of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI: HI leading to death, neurosurgery, intubation >1 day or admission ≥2 days with abnormal computed tomography [CT]) was descriptively analysed. Results: Intentional injuries were identified in 372 of 20 137 (1.8%) head-injured children.

About 75.7% of victims of assault by caregivers were <2 years, whereas in other categories, only 4.9% were <2 years. Overall, 66.9% of victims were male. Rates of CT performance and abnormal CT varied: assault by caregivers 68.9%/47.6%, by peers 18.6%/27.8%, by strangers 37.1%/5.7%. ciTBI rate was 22.3% in assault by caregivers, 3.1% when caused by peers and 0.0% with other perpetrators.

This study investigates whether the neurological examination can predict the presence of PVWD on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). No prior studies have assessed whether the neurological examination can predict the presence of PVWD on MRI. Methods: A focused neurological examination was performed on a random selection of patients referred for a MRI of the brain. Staff neuroradiologists who were blinded to the results of the physical examination independently read the MRI scans. The MRI interpretations were divided into four categories based on the degree of PVWD: none, mild, moderate, severe. Results: Twenty-three subjects had some degree of PVWD, while 25 subjects had none. The total number of neurologic signs correlated significantly with the severity of PVWD even when adjusting for the effect of age (rho=0.67, p<.001). Ninety-one percent of subjects with PVWD had three or more abnormal signs, while 76% of subjects without PVWD had fewer than three. Abnormalities with the three step motor sequencing and horizontal visual tracking tests were maximally predictive of PVWD. One or both of these tests were abnormal in 96% of subjects with PVWD, while 64% of subjects without PVWD had no problems with either test.

METHODS: Thirty children with and without ADHD performed a visual cued Go/Nogo task  in two conditions (white noise or no-noise exposure), in which behavioral and P300  (mean amplitudes) data were analyzed. Spontaneous eye-blink rates were also recorded  and participants went through neuropsychological assessment. Two separate analyses  were conducted with each child separately assigned into two groups (1) ADHD or  typically developing children (TDC), and (2) noise beneficiaries or  non-beneficiaries according to the observed performance during the experiment. This  latest categorization, based on a new index we called ""Noise Benefits Index"" (NBI),  was proposed to determine a neuropsychological profile positively sensitive to  noise. RESULTS: Noise exposure reduced omission rate in children with ADHD, who were  no longer different from TDC. Eye-blink rate was higher in children with ADHD but  was not modulated by white noise. NBI indicated a significant relationship between  ADHD and noise benefit. Strong correlations were observed between noise benefit and  neuropsychological weaknesses in vigilance and inhibition. Participants who  benefited from noise had an increased Go P300 in the noise condition. CONCLUSION:  The improvement of children with ADHD with white noise supports both optimal  stimulation theory and MBA model. However, eye-blink rate results question the  dopaminergic hypothesis in the latter. The NBI evidenced a profile positively  sensitive to noise, related with ADHD, and associated with weaker cognitive control.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,9.2,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

A modified emotional Stroop task was used to investigate temporal characteristics of the threat response by assessing response latencies to interpersonally threatening words (immediate interference) and two directly subsequent neutral filler words (delayed interference). Greater immediate and delayed interference to threatening words was observed (n = 125), with higher levels of attachment anxiety associated with immediate interference to threatening cues, and lower levels with delayed interference. Thus, attachment anxiety was related to the speed at which moderate perceived threat disrupted ongoing processes under top-down attentional control. Furthermore, top-down attentional control moderated the extent to which immediate or delayed interference was observed. Among participants who demonstrated relatively stronger top-down attentional control, immediate and delayed interference to threatening cues was minimal, suggesting that results involving emotional Stroop interference were primarily attributable to participants with relatively weaker top-down attentional control. The implications of these findings are considered within the broader context of performance-based and neuroimaging research, with suggestions for future applied research.

SRCD is distinct from dyslexia (DYS) in that individuals with SRCD show poor comprehension despite adequate decoding skills. Despite its prevalence and considerable behavioral research, there is not yet a unified cognitive profile of SRCD. While its neuroanatomical basis is unknown, SRCD could be anomalous in regions subserving their commonly reported cognitive weaknesses in semantic processing or executive function. Here we investigated, for the first time, patterns of gray matter volume difference in SRCD as compared to DYS and typical developing (TD) adolescent readers (N = 41). A linear support vector machine algorithm was applied to whole brain gray matter volumes generated through voxel-based morphometry. As expected, DYS differed significantly from TD in a pattern that included features from left fusiform and supramarginal gyri (DYS vs. TD: 80.0 %, p < 0.01). SRCD was well differentiated not only from TD (92.5 %, p < 0.001) but also from DYS (88.0 %, p < 0.001). Of particular interest were findings of reduced gray matter volume in right frontal areas that were also supported by univariate analysis. These areas are thought to subserve executive processes relevant for reading, such as monitoring and manipulating mental representations. Thus, preliminary analyses suggest that SRCD readers possess a distinct neural profile compared to both TD and DYS readers and that these differences might be linked to domain-general abilities.

Recent findings Individuals carrying the 22q11.2 microdeletion are at risk for diverse psychiatric diagnoses across the lifespan, including schizophrenia in a significant minority, and anxiety or mood disorder in the majority. Symptoms and cognitive disruptions can be grouped into domains: attention-executive deficits, social- cognitive deficits, anxiety-affective dysregulation, and psychotic phenomena. These domains do not respect the boundaries of traditional diagnostic categories, and can be consistently recognized in children, adolescents and adults. There is early evidence that some symptom-domain disruptions may predict adult psychiatric morbidity. Summary If a core neuropsychiatric phenotype does exist in 22q11DS, its detection is likely to require dimensional assessment of subtle aspects of cognitive and emotional processing, not encompassed by current diagnostic systems. A core phenotype would account for disruptions across multiple symptom domains, directly reflecting genetic and neurobiological mechanisms. Relative severity of a core phenotype would predict risk for multiple psychiatric disorders, and could, therefore, be an important target for therapeutic and preventive interventions. A core phenotype meeting these criteria has not yet been defined for 22q11DS. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Heterozygous PAX6 mutation is associated with aniridia and abnormalities of the interhemispheric pathway in humans. We present the case of a 12 year old boy with a known mutation of the PAX6 gene. There were parental concerns regarding his hearing, but repeated pure-tone audiograms were normal. He had a battery of standard central auditory tests, which gave abnormal results in tests which required auditory interhemispheric transfer (dichotic digits and pattern tests). A speech and language assessment, which yielded age-appropriate scores for speech, receptive and expressive language, revealed impaired verbal working memory. These test results were interpreted as indicating impaired auditory sensory and higher order interhemispheric transfer, consistent with reported findings in adults with mutations in PAX6, and correlated with his parent-reported hearing difficulties.

Clinical findings in children with autism and a functional neuroimaging study of normal adults,British Journal of Psychiatry,NaN,"Background. The mind's ability to think about the mind has attracted substantial research interest in cognitive science in recent decades, as 'theory of mind'. No research has attempted to identify the brain basis of this ability, probably because it involves several separate processes. As a first step, we investigated one component process - the ability to recognise mental state terms. Method. In Experiment 1, we tested a group of children with autism (known to have theory of mind deficits) and a control group of children with mental handicap, for their ability to recognise mental state terms in a word list. This was to test if the mental state recognition task was related to traditional theory of mind tests. In Experiment 2, we investigated if in the normal brain, recognition of mental state terms might be localised. The procedure employed single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) in normal adult volunteers. We tested the prediction (based on available neurological and animal lesion studies) that there would be increased activation in the orbito-frontal cortex during this task, relative to a control condition, and relative to an adjacent frontal area (frontal-polar cortex). Results. In Experiment 1, the group with autism performed significantly worse than the group without autism. In Experiment 2, there was increased cerebral blood flow during the mental state recognition task in the right orbito-frontal cortex relative to the left frontal-polar region. Conclusions. This simple mental state recognition task appears to relate to theory of mind, in that both are impaired in autism.

The anterior temporal lobes appear to be important for the process of conceptual combination. In a previous study (Baron et al., 2010) we showed that the neural representation of complex concepts (e.g., young man) in the left anterior temporal lobe is additive. Specifically, in that region, the representation of a complex concept can be predicted by the superimposition of the voxel-wise neural representations of its constituent concepts (e.g., young+. man). However, this finding could be the result of phonological similarity or the simple co-activation of constituent concepts. Here we use concepts that are only related semantically: boy, girl, woman, man, female, male, child, and adult. The neural representation for each concept was evoked through a visual categorization task. Subsequent brain maps were then analyzed using a searchlight analysis meant to show areas of the cortex where multiplicative (as well as additive) conceptual combination occurred (e.g., areas in which activations for boy correlated with the product of the activations for male and child). Across all participants, the left anterior temporal lobe showed such an effect. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,28,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
"Baron, Sean G.",2013,databases,The neural basis of compositionality: Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of conceptual combination,NaN,NaN,"The use of concepts underlies the most basic cognitive processes. Consequently, psychologists have long been interested in understanding the behavioral and neural correlates of conceptual knowledge and its manipulation. This has led to a rich set of research results that have expanded our understanding of concepts. However, upon reviewing this literature it is clear that little of it expressly addresses the neural basis of conceptual combination. Conceptual combination is the mental construction of complex concepts (e.g.,  GRADUATE STUDENT) from simpler constituents (e.g., GRADUATE and STUDENT). The process of conceptual combination serves as the foundation for human conceptual creativity—our ability to create an infinite number of new ideas from a limited set. Across three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, I explore the neural basis of basic conceptual combination. In the first I prove the feasibility of using fMRI to examine modifier-substantive combinations, and provide evidence for multiplicative combination (e.g., YOUNG ×  MAN → YOUNG MAN) in the left anterior temporal lobe. Studies two and three utilize non-phonologically dependent concepts (e.g., MALE × CHILD →  BOY and WILD × BIRD →  EAGLE) and also point to the left anterior temporal lobe as a likely site of conceptual combination. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of the left anterior temporal lobe in conceptual combination, and also reveal a way for the cortex to store and process complex concepts in a non-redundant fashion.

The separate adult and child components were compared using the Congruence Coefficient. Brain sources of each assessed component were examined using eLORETA. Results: Corresponding adult/child components were tentatively identified: two N1 subcomponents (N1-1, PN) and P2, followed by N2, P3 (separate P3a/P3b in children), the classic Slow Wave (SW), and a diffuse Late Positivity (LP). While early and late components showed similarities, the intermediate P2 and N2 differed substantially in their stimulus effects.

Methods: We investigated 35 right-handed children and adolescents aged 7–16 years with a functional magnetic resonance imaging language paradigm and a comprehensive language and verbal memory examination. Results: We found that less lateralized language was significantly correlated with better language performance across areas of the brain and across different language tasks. Less lateralized language in the overall brain was associated with better in-scanner task accuracy on a semantic language decision task and out-of-scanner vocabulary and verbal fluency. Specifically, less lateralized frontal lobe language dominance was associated with better in-scanner task accuracy and out-of-scanner verbal fluency. Furthermore, less lateralized parietal language was associated with better out-of-scanner verbal memory across learning, short- and long-delay trials. In contrast, we did not find any relationship between temporal lobe language laterality and verbal performance.

Semantic clustering is an effective strategy to enhance encoding of verbal episodic memory (VEM) when word lists are semantically related. Self-initiated mobilization of this strategy has been associated with increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex, a key region in the pathophysiology of OCD. We therefore studied children and adolescents with OCD during uncued semantic clustering strategy application in a VEM functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-encoding paradigm. Method A total of 25 pediatric patients with OCD (aged 8.1-17.5 years) and 25 healthy controls (HC, aged 8.1-16.9) matched for age, gender, handedness, and IQ were evaluated using a block design VEM paradigm that manipulated semantically related and unrelated words. Results The semantic clustering strategy score (SCS) predicted VEM performance in HC (p &lt;.001, R2 = 0.635), but not in patients (p =.099). Children with OCD also presented hypoactivation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (cluster-corrected p &lt;.001). Within-group analysis revealed a negative correlation between Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and activation of orbitofrontal cortex in the group with OCD. Finally, a positive correlation between age and SCS was found in HC (p =.001, r = 0.635), but not in patients with OCD (p =.936, r = 0.017). Conclusion Children with OCD presented altered brain activation during the VEM paradigm and absence of expected correlation between SCS and age, and between SCS and total words recalled. These results suggest that different neural mechanisms underlie self-initiated semantic clustering in OCD. © 2015 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,12.2,16,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Region of interest analyses examined relationships among resting state connectivity, symptom dimensions (behavioral and emotional dysregulation measured with the Parent General Behavior Inventory-10 Item Mania Scale [PGBI-10M]; dimensional severity measures of mania, depression, anxiety), and diagnostic categories (Bipolar Spectrum Disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, and Disruptive Behavior Disorders). After adjusting for demographic variables, two dimensional measures showed significant inverse relationships with resting state connectivity, regardless of diagnosis: 1) PGBI-10M with amygdala-left posterior insula/bilateral putamen; and 2) depressive symptoms with amygdala-right posterior insula connectivity. Diagnostic categories showed no significant relationships with resting state connectivity.

Identifying neuroimaging measures associated with behavioral and emotional dysregulation in youth may inform understanding of underlying dimensional vs disorder-specific pathophysiologic features. Objective: To identify, in a large cohort of behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth, neuroimaging measures that (1) are associated with behavioral and emotional dysregulation pathologic dimensions (behavioral and emotional dysregulation measured with the Parent General Behavior Inventory 10-Item Mania Scale [PGBI-10M], mania, depression, and anxiety) or (2) differentiate diagnostic categories (bipolar spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders). Design, setting, and participants: A multisite neuroimaging studywas conducted from February 1, 2011, to April 15, 2012, at 3 academic medical centers: University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Participants included a referred sample of behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study (n = 85) and healthy youth (n = 20). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Region-of-interest analyses examined relationships among prefrontal-ventral striatal reward circuitry during a reward paradigm (win, loss, and control conditions), symptom dimensions, and diagnostic categories. Results: Regardless of diagnosis, higher PGBI-10M scores were associated with greater left middle prefrontal cortical activity (r = 0.28) and anxiety with greater right dorsal anterior cingulate cortical (r = 0.27) activity to win. The 20 highest (t = 2.75) and 20 lowest (t = 2.42) PGBI-10M-scoring youth showed significantly greater left middle prefrontal cortical activity to win compared with 20 healthy youth. Disruptive behavior disorders were associated with lower left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity to win (t = 2.68) (all P < .05, corrected). Conclusions and relevance: Greater PGBI-10M-related left middle prefrontal cortical activity and anxiety-related right dorsal anterior cingulate cortical activity to win may reflect heightened reward sensitivity and greater attention to reward in behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth regardless of diagnosis. Reduced left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity to win may reflect reward insensitivity in youth with disruptive behavior disorders. Despite a distinct reward-related neurophysiologic feature in disruptive behavior disorders, findings generally support a dimensional approach to studying neural mechanisms in behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth. © 2014 American Medical Association.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,13.65,17,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Emerging evidence indicates that children with cleft lip and/or cleft palate have higher rates of learning disabilities than the general population and differences in brain morphology. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging of 12 individuals with isolated unilateral complete clefts of the lip and palate produced functional images during three lexical processing tasks: generation of verbs, opposites, and rhymes. Direct statistical comparisons were made between subjects with cleft lip and palate and controls (matched for age and performance) from an extant data set, both as a group and individually. RESULTS: Two types of differences were found. Compared with unaffected controls, subjects with clefts showed a delayed and elongated blood oxygen level-dependent response in regions found throughout the cerebrum, including in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, right precuneus, and right temporal gyrus. A right middle frontal gyrus region was activated by these tasks in controls but not in subjects with clefts. Developmental analysis showed that subjects 14.5 years and older (n = 5) had a larger number of age-related regions differing in blood oxygen level-dependent response from controls than did younger subjects (n = 7). Single-patient analysis demonstrated substantial individual variability. CONCLUSIONS: Children with cleft lip and palate, performing lexical processing tasks at a comparable level of proficiency, use a similar but nonidentical functional neuroanatomy than peers without clefts. Differing neural circuitry for language tasks and differing developmental trajectories could help explain the predisposition to velopharyngeal dysfunction and learning disabilities in this population.

Studies of plasticity in blindness suggest that this mind–brain mapping is highly flexible during development. In blindness, ‘visual’ cortices take on higher-cognitive functions, including language and mathematics, becoming sensitive to the grammatical structure of spoken sentences and the difficulty of math equations. Visual cortex activity at rest becomes synchronized with higher-cognitive networks. Such repurposing is striking in light of the cognitive and evolutionary differences between vision, language, and mathematics. We propose that human cortices are cognitively pluripotent, that is, capable of assuming a wide range of cognitive functions. Specialization is driven by input during development, which is itself constrained by connectivity and experience. ‘The child who methodically adds two numbers from right to left, carrying a digit when necessary, may be using the same algorithm that is implemented by the wires and transistors of the cash register in the neighborhood supermarket…’ ▓▓Vision, 1982, David Marr © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

A fundamental question in cognitive science is how nature and nurture contribute to the development of such conceptual categories. What innate mechanisms do children bring to the learning problem? How does experience contribute to development? In this article we discuss insights into these longstanding questions from cognitive neuroscience studies of blindness. Despite drastically different sensory experiences, behavioural and neuroscientific work suggests that blind children acquire typical concepts of objects, actions, and mental states. Blind people think and talk about these categories in ways that are similar to sighted people. Neuroimaging reveals that blind people make such judgements relying on the same neural mechanisms as sighted people. One way to interpret these findings is that neurocognitive development is largely hardwired, and so differences in experience have little consequence. Contrary to this interpretation, neuroimaging studies also show that blindness profoundly reorganizes the visual system. Most strikingly, developmental blindness enables ""visual"" circuits to participate in high-level cognitive functions, including language processing. Thus, blindness qualitatively changes sensory representations, but leaves conceptual representations largely unchanged. The effect of sensory experience on concepts is modest, despite the brain's potential for neuroplasticity. © 2012 Copyright Psychology Press.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Pre-ECMO, 20 (20%) had a pre-existing neurologic diagnosis, 40 (40%) had cardiac arrest, and 10 of 47 (21%) children with neuroimaging had acute abnormal findings. Of 50 children eligible for follow-up at 6 or 12 months, 40 (80%) returned for at least one visit. At the follow-up visit of longest interval from ECMO, the median Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II) score was 91 (interquartile range [IQR], 81-98), the median Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) score was 1 (IQR, 0-2), and the median Mullen Scales of Early Learning composite score was 85 (IQR, 72-96).

The Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category at hospital discharge showed a strong relationship with unfavorable VABS-II and PSOM scores at 6 or 12 months after ECMO. In this study, we report a higher prevalence of pre-ECMO neurologic conditions than previously described.

Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Single tertiary-care academic center. Participants: Eighty children who underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between June 2010 and December 2013. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We measured six brain injury biomarkers (glial fibrillary acidic protein, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1/chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, neuron-specific enolase, S100b, intercellular adhesion molecule-5, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor) daily during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, using an electrochemiluminescent multiplex assay. We recorded clinical, neuroimaging, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation course data. We analyzed the association of biomarker concentrations with favorable versus unfavorable outcome at hospital discharge. Favorable outcome was defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category 1, 2, or no change from baseline. Patients had a median age of 3 days (interquartile range, 1 d-10 mo), and 56% were male. Thirty-three of 80 (41%) had unfavorable outcome, and 22 of 70 (31%) had abnormal neuroimaging findings during or after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Peak concentrations were significantly higher in patients with unfavorable outcome than in those with favorable outcome for glial fibrillary acidic protein (p = 0.002), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1/chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (p = 0.030), neuron-specific enolase (p = 0.006), and S100b (p = 0.015) and in patients with versus without abnormal neuroimaging findings for glial fibrillary acidic protein (p = 0.001) and intercellular adhesion molecule-5 (p = 0.001). The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for unfavorable outcome was 0.73 for a noncollinear biomarker combination. After removing collinear biomarkers, the adjusted odds ratios for unfavorable outcome were 2.89 (95% CI, 1.09-7.73) for neuron-specific enolase, using a cutoff of 62.0 ng/mL, and 2.15 (95% CI, 1.06-4.38) for glial fibrillary acidic protein, using a cutoff of 0.46 ng/mL. Conclusions: Elevated plasma brain injury biomarker concentrations during the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation course are associated with unfavorable outcome and/or the presence of neuroimaging abnormalities.

Here we comprehensively documented its execution in surgical planning in epilepsy. A questionnaire focusing on cognitive design, image acquisition, analysis and interpretation, and practical considerations was developed. Individuals responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting clinical language fMRI data at 63 epilepsy surgical programs responded. The central finding was of marked heterogeneity in all aspects of fMRI. Most programs use multiple tasks, with a fifth routinely using 2, 3, 4, or 5 tasks with a modal run duration of 5 min. Variants of over 15 protocols are in routine use with forms of noun–verb generation, verbal fluency, and semantic decision-making used most often. Nearly all aspects of data acquisition and analysis vary markedly. Neither of the two best-validated protocols was used by more than 10% of respondents. Preprocessing steps are broadly consistent across sites, language-related blood flow is most often identified using general linear modeling (76% of respondents), and statistical thresholding typically varies by patient (79%). The software SPM is most often used. fMRI programs inconsistently include input from experts with all required skills (imaging, cognitive assessment, MR physics, statistical analysis, and brain–behavior relationships).

Using ecologically relevant language stimuli that were matched for difficulty according to developmental level, we analyze the effects of task, age, neuropsychological skills, and post-task performance on fMRI activation and hemispheric laterality. Areas of supramodal language processing are identified, with the most robust region being left-lateralized activation along the superior temporal sulcus. Functionally, this conjunction has a role in semantic and syntactic processing, leading us to refer to this conjunction as "" comprehension cortex."" Different from adults, supramodal areas for children include less extensive inferior frontal gyrus but more extensive right cerebellum and right temporal pole. Broader neuroanatomical pathways are recruited for reading, reflecting the more active processing and larger set of cognitive demands needed for reading compared to listening to stories. ROI analyses reveal that reading is a less lateralized language task than listening in inferior frontal and superior temporal areas, which likely reflects the difficulty of the task as children in this study are still developing their reading skills. For listening to stories, temporal activation is stable by age four with no correlations with age, neuropsychological skills or post-task performance. In contrast, frontal activation during listening to stories occurs more often in older children, and frontal activation is positively correlated with better performance on comprehension questions, suggesting that the activation of frontal networks may reflect greater integration and depth of story processing. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,8.7,12,NaN,story listening/reading vs. dots,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In 3-D structure-from-motion (SFM) perception, motion and depth information are first extracted in this visual stream to allow object categorization, which is in turn mediated by the ventral visual stream. Such interplay justifies the use of SFM paradigms to understand dorsal–ventral integration of visual information. The nature of such processing is particularly interesting to be investigated in a neurological model of cognitive dissociation between dorsal (impaired) and ventral stream (relatively preserved) processing, Williams syndrome (WS). In the current fMRI study, we assessed dorsal versus ventral stream processing by using a performance-matched 3-D SFM object categorization task. We found evidence for substantial reorganization of the dorsal stream in WS as assessed by whole-brain ANOVA random effects analysis, with subtle differences in ventral activation. Dorsal reorganization was expressed by larger medial recruitment in WS (cuneus, precuneus, and retrosplenial cortex) in contrast with controls, which showed the expected dorsolateral pattern (caudal intraparietal sulcus and lateral occipital cortex). In summary, we found a substantial reorganization of dorsal stream regions in WS in response to simple visual categories and 3-D SFM perception, with less affected ventral stream. Our results corroborate the existence of a medial dorsal pathway that provides the substrate for information rerouting and reorganization in the presence of lateral dorsal stream vulnerability. This interpretation is consistent with recent findings suggesting parallel routing of information in medial and lateral parts of dorsal stream.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with social influence with regard to a common consumer good: music. Our study population was adolescents, age 12-17. Music is a common purchase in this age group, and it is widely believed that adolescent behavior is influenced by perceptions of popularity in their reference group. Using 15-s clips of songs from MySpace.com, we obtained behavioral measures of preferences and neurobiological responses to the songs. The data were gathered with, and without, the overall popularity of the song revealed. Song popularity had a significant effect on the participants' likability ratings of the songs. fMRI results showed a strong correlation between the participants' rating and activity in the caudate nucleus, a region previously implicated in reward-driven actions. The tendency to change one's evaluation of a song was positively correlated with activation in the anterior insula and anterior cingulate, two regions that are associated with physiological arousal and negative affective states. Sensitivity to popularity was linked to lower activation levels in the middle temporal gyrus, suggesting a lower depth of musical semantic processing. Our results suggest that a principal mechanism whereby popularity ratings affect consumer choice is through the anxiety generated by the mismatch between one's own preferences and others'. This mismatch anxiety motivates people to switch their choices in the direction of the consensus. Our data suggest that this is a major force behind the conformity observed in music tastes in some teenagers. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We describe, for the first time, a case of developmental dynamic dysphasia (DDD) in a right-handed adolescent boy (subject D) with cortical malformations involving language-eloquent regions (inferior frontal gyrus) in both the left and the right hemispheres. Language evaluation revealed a markedly reduced verbal output affecting phonemic and semantic fluency, phrase and sentence generation and verbal communication in everyday life. Auditory comprehension, repetition, naming, reading and spelling were relatively preserved, but executive function was impaired. Multimodal neuroimaging showed a malformed cerebral cortex with atypical configuration and placement of white matter tracts bilaterally and abnormal callosal fibers. Dichotic listening showed right hemisphere dominance for language, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) additionally revealed dissociated hemispheric language representation with right frontal activation for phonology and bilateral dominance for semantic processing. Moreover, subject D also had congenital mirror movements (CMM), defined as involuntary movements of one side of the body that mirror intentional movements of the other side. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and fMRI during voluntary unimanual (left and right) hand movements showed bilateral motor cortex recruitment and tractography revealed a lack of decussation of bilateral corticospinal tracts. Genetic testing aimed to detect mutations that disrupt the development of commissural tracts correlating with CMM (e.g., Germline DCC mutations) was negative. Overall, our findings suggest that DDD in subject D resulted from the underdevelopment of the left inferior frontal gyrus with limited capacity for plastic reorganization by its homologous counterpart in the right hemisphere. Corpus callosum anomalies probably contributed to hinder interhemispheric connectivity necessary to compensate language and communication deficits after left frontal involvement. © Copyright © 2020 Berthier, Dávila, Torres-Prioris, Moreno-Torres, Clarimón, Dols-Icardo, Postigo, Fernández, Edelkraut, Moreno-Campos, Molina-Sánchez, de Zaldivar and López-Barroso.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The behavioural/psychiatric outcome of a selection of the large number of childhood epilepsy syndromes is presented. The rate of autism in West syndrome, particularly in children who have tuberous sclerosis with temporal tubers, is high. In Dravet syndrome there is a loss of skills, with an associated increase in behavioural problems. The frequency of both subtle and overt seizures in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome almost certainly accounts for the apparent poor motivation; however, a marked improvement in seizure control with treatment can also result in behavioural problems, probably as a result of the ""release phenomenon"".

However, at the  label fusion stage, a majority of algorithms focus primarily on optimizing  weight-maps associated with the atlas library based on a theoretical objective  function that approximates the segmentation error. In contrast, we propose a novel  method-Autocorrecting Walks over Localized Markov Random Fields (AWoL-MRF)-that aims  at mimicking the sequential process of manual segmentation, which is the  gold-standard for virtually all the segmentation methods. AWoL-MRF begins with a set  of candidate labels generated by a multi-atlas segmentation pipeline as an initial  label distribution and refines low confidence regions based on a localized Markov  random field (L-MRF) model using a novel sequential inference process (walks). We  show that AWoL-MRF produces state-of-the-art results with superior accuracy and  robustness with a small atlas library compared to existing methods. We validate the  proposed approach by performing hippocampal segmentations on three independent  datasets: (1) Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Database (ADNI); (2) First Episode  Psychosis patient cohort; and (3) A cohort of preterm neonates scanned early in life  and at term-equivalent age. We assess the improvement in the performance  qualitatively as well as quantitatively by comparing AWoL-MRF with majority vote,  STAPLE, and Joint Label Fusion methods.

In this monograph, we consider four aspects of this influence. In the first section, we examine differences between monolinguals and bilinguals in children's acquisition of language and adults' linguistic processing, particularly in terms of lexical retrieval. Children learning two languages from birth follow the same milestones for language acquisition as monolinguals do (first words, first use of grammar) but may use different strategies for language acquisition, and they generally have a smaller vocabulary in each language than do monolingual children learning only a single language. Adult bilinguals typically take longer to retrieve individual words than monolinguals do, and they generate fewer words when asked to satisfy a constraint such as category membership or initial letter. In the second section, we consider the impact of bilingualism on nonverbal cognitive processing in both children and adults. The primary effect in this case is the enhancement of executive control functions in bilinguals. On tasks that require inhibition of distracting information, switching between tasks, or holding information in mind while performing a task, bilinguals of all ages outperform comparable monolinguals. A plausible reason is that bilinguals recruit control processes to manage their ongoing linguistic performance and that these control processes become enhanced for other unrelated aspects of cognitive processing. Preliminary evidence also suggests that the executive control advantage may even mitigate cognitive decline in older age and contribute to cognitive reserve, which in turn may postpone Alzheimer's disease. In the third section, we describe the brain networks that are responsible for language processing in bilinguals and demonstrate their involvement in nonverbal executive control for bilinguals. We begin by reviewing neuroimaging research that identifies the networks used for various nonverbal executive control tasks in the literature. These networks are used as a reference point to interpret the way in which bilinguals perform both verbal and nonverbal control tasks. The results show that bilinguals manage attention to their two language systems using the same networks that are used by monolinguals performing nonverbal tasks. In the fourth section, we discuss the special circumstances that surround the referral of bilingual children (e.g., language delays) and adults (e.g., stroke) for clinical intervention. These referrals are typically based on standardized assessments that use normative data from monolingual populations, such as vocabulary size and lexical retrieval. As we have seen, however, these measures are often different for bilinguals, both for children and adults. We discuss the implications of these linguistic differences for standardized test performance and clinical approaches. We conclude by considering some questions that have important public policy implications. What are the pros and cons of French or Spanish immersion educational programs, for example? Also, if bilingualism confers advantages in certain respects, how about three languages-do the benefitsincrease? In the healthcare field, how can current knowledge help in the treatment of bilingual aphasia patients following stroke? Given the recent increase in bilingualism as a research topic, answers to these and other related questions should be available in the near future. © The Author(s) 2009.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Some authors put forward a modular account according to which episodic memory and recollection-based processes are crucially dependent on the hippocampal formation whereas semantic acquisition and familiarity-based processes rely on the adjacent parahippocampal gyri. Others defend a unitary view.We report the case of VJ, a boy with developmental amnesia of most likely perinatal onset diagnosed at the age of 8. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including quantitative volumetric measurements of the hippocampal formation and of the entorhinal, perirhinal, and temporopolar cortices, showed severe, bilateral atrophy of the hippocampal formation, fornix and mammillary bodies; by contrast, the perirhinal cortex was within normal range and the entorhinal and temporopolar cortex remained within two standard deviations (SDs) from controls' mean. We examined the development of his semantic knowledge from childhood to teenage as well as his recognition and cued recall memory abilities. On tasks tapping semantic memory, VJ increased his raw scores across years at the same rate as children from large standardisation samples, except for one task; he achieved average performance, consistent with his socio-educational background. He performed within normal range on 74% of recognition tests and achieved average to above average scores on 42% of them despite very severe impairment on 82% of episodic recall tasks. Both faces and landscapes-scenes gave rise to above average scores when tested with coloured stimuli. Cued recall, although impaired, was largely superior to free recall.This case supports a modular account of the MTL with episodic, but not semantic memory depending on the hippocampal formation. Furthermore, the overall pattern of findings is consistent with evidence from both brain-damaged and neuroimaging studies indicating that recollection requires intact hippocampal formation and familiarity relies, at least partly, on the adjacent temporal lobe cortex. © 2011 Elsevier Srl.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Participants, aged 9-15, were scanned while performing rhyming and spelling judgments on pairs of visually presented words. The orthographic and phonological similarity between words in the pair was independently manipulated, resulting in four conditions. In the nonconflicting conditions, both orthography and phonology of the words were either (1) similar (lime-dime) or (2) different (staff-gain); in conflicting conditions, words had (3) similar phonology and different orthography (jazz-has) or (4) different phonology and similar orthography (pint-mint). The comparison between tasks resulted in greater activation for the rhyming task in bilateral inferior frontal gyri (BA 45/47), and greater activation for the spelling task in bilateral inferior/superior parietal lobules (BA 40/7), suggesting greater involvement of phonological and semantic processing in the rhyming task, and nonlinguistic spatial processing in the spelling task. Conflicting conditions were more difficult in both tasks and resulted in greater activation in the above regions. The results suggest that when children encounter inconsistency between orthographic and phonological information they show greater engagement of both orthographic and phonological processing. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,11.5,15,NaN,visual spelling/rhyming judgment vs. symbols,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Reward processing has been indexed by recruitment of incentive-motivational neurocircuitry of the ventral striatum (VS), including nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an incentive task to determine whether externalizing symptomatology in adolescence is correlated with an enhanced VS recruitment by cues for rewards, or by deliveries of rewards. Twelve community-recruited adolescents with externalizing disorders (AED) and 12 age/gender-matched controls responded to targets to win or avoid losing $0, $0.20, $1, $5, or an unknown amount (ranging from $0.20 to $5). Results: Cues to respond for rewards activated the NAcc (relative to cues for no incentive), in both subject groups similarly, with greatest NAcc recruitment by cues for the largest reward. Loss-anticipatory NAcc signal increase was detected in a volume-of-interest analysis - but this increase occurred only in trials when subjects hit the target. Relative to controls, AED showed significantly elevated NAcc activation by a linear contrast between reward notification versus notification of failure to win reward. In a post hoc reanalysis, VS and pregenual anterior cingulate activation by the reward versus non-reward outcome contrast also directly correlated with Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Externalizing total scores (across all subjects) in lieu of a binary diagnosis. Finally, both groups showed right insula activation by loss notifications (contrasted with avoided losses). Conclusions: Externalizing behavior, whether assessed dimensionally with a questionnaire, or in the form of a diagnostic categorization, is associated with an exaggerated limbic response to outcomes of reward-directed behavior. This could be a neurobiological signature of the behavioral sensitivity to laboratory reward delivery that is characteristic of children with externalizing symptomatology. Of interest is future research on incentive-motivational processing in more severe, clinically referred AED. © 2009 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,15.3,17,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

MATERIALS AND METHODS: With institutional review board approval, 125 fMRI time series from 50 different clinical language cases were retrospectively reviewed by three blinded readers who selected 3-dimensional points representing the perceived center of Wernicke's and Broca's areas using three language tasks (semantic decision, SD; sentence comprehension, SC; and silent word generation, WG). Point dispersion values were then calculated using the perimeter of the 3-dimensional triangle defined by the three readers' selections. RESULTS: After resolving interobserver laterality disagreements, there was no difference in spatial variability between the three tasks (P = .069). The SD task had the fewest interobserver laterality disagreements (P = .028) and the SC task had fewer failed localizations for Broca's area (P = .050) and Wernicke's area (P = .013). CONCLUSION: While there were no differences between interobserver spatial variability in language area localization between the three tasks, language task choice impacts the accuracy of fMRI language area identification because tasks vary in their rates of interobserver laterality disagreements and failed localizations. A combination of tasks including one with low laterality disagreements (eg, SD) and one with few failed localizations (eg, SC) may offer the best combination. © 2014 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,38.3,66,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

This heterogeneity has the potential to reduce power in genetic, neuroimaging, and clinical trials. Despite a mounting number of studies, there remains debate regarding the exact factor structure of OCD symptoms. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to determine the factor structure of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist. Method: Studies were included if they involved subjects with OCD and included an exploratory factor analysis of the 13 Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist categories or the items therein. A varimax-rotation was conducted in SAS 9.1 using the PROC FACTOR CORR to extract factors from samplesize weighted co-occurrence matrices. Stratified meta-analysis was conducted to determine the factor structure of OCD in studies involving children and adults separately. Results: Twenty-one studies involving 5,124 participants were included. The four factors generated were 1) symmetry: symmetry obsessions and repeating, ordering, and counting compulsions; 2) forbidden thoughts: aggression, sexual, religious, and somatic obsessions and checking compulsions, 3) cleaning: cleaning and contamination, and 4) hoarding: hoarding obsessions and compulsions. Factor analysis of studies including adults yielded an identical factor structure compared to the overall meta-analysis. Factor analysis of child-only studies differed in that checking loaded highest on the symmetry factor and somatic obsessions, on the cleaning factor. Conclusions: A four-factor structure explained a large proportion of the heterogeneity in the clinical symptoms of OCD.

Patients and methods: Cerebral MRI of 158 patients with cerebellar ataxia and no supratentorial abnormality were examined according to a new categorization system based on posterior fossa imaging. The clinical and radiological findings were confronted to biochemical and/or genetic results using the MR cerebellar algorithm. Seven groups of cerebellar MRI pattern were described: vermian dysgenesis (n=27), cerebellar hypoplasia (n=15), hemispheric cerebellar dysgenesis (n=6), unilateral hemispheric atrophy (n=5), global cerebellar atrophy (n=84), signal abnormalities (n=11) and normal MRI (n=10). Cerebellar hypoplasia, vermian dysgenesis and hemispheric cerebellar dysgenesis groups were classified as malformative disorders. Global atrophy and signal abnormality groups were classified as metabolic disorders. Results: In the vermian dysgenesis group, a specific genetic diagnosis was obtained in eight children (8/27) and all of the mutated genes (AHI1 (JBS3), CEP290 (JBS5), TMEM67 (JBS6), and RPGRIP1L (JBS7)) are involved in primary cilia function. In the group of pontocerebellar hypoplasia specific genetic diagnosis was obtained in one patient (PCH2) (1/15). Thus, nine of 42 children classified as malformative disorder had a molecular diagnosis. Global atrophy and signal abnormality groups were classified as metabolic disorders, specific biochemical was obtained in 46/95 children. In global atrophy group, respiratory chain deficiency was diagnosed in 18 children (18/84). In 21 children a congenital disorders of glycosylation type 1a (CDG Ia) was diagnosed (21/84) and infantile neuroaxonale dystrophy (INAD) was diagnosed in one child. In signal abnormalities group, specific biochemical diagnosis was obtained in six out of 11 children, five children with respiratory chain deficiency and one child with sulphite oxidase deficiency. In hemispheric cerebellar dysgenesis and normal MRI groups, no biological diagnosis was found for any of the patients. In the group of unilateral hemispheric atrophy, we hypothesized a clastic prenatal injury.

Two explanations have been proposed: (1) psychosocial factors related to differences in facial appearance may lead to low self-concept and subsequent shyness, or (2) abnormal development of brain structures involved in social function, such as the ventral frontal cortex (VFC), may underlie the difference. To investigate these two possibilities this study was designed to evaluate measures of social function in relation to measures of self-concept and VFC morphology. Subjects included 30 boys (age 7-12) with ICLP and a comparison group of 43 boys without cleft in the same age category. Social function and self-concept were assessed using questionnaires with standardized scoring filled out by subjects and one of their parents. The cortical volume and surface area of the VFC, composed of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and straight gyrus (SG), were evaluated using structural magnetic resonance imaging. The ICLP subjects had significantly impaired social function relative to the comparison group. No difference in self-concept was identified. VFC morphology revealed significant differences between groups, particularly decreased volume and surface area in the left SG of the ICLP group. Moreover, abnormal VFC measures were correlated with social dysfunction but measures of self-concept were not. These results are consistent with the possibility that aberrant VFC development may partially underlie social dysfunction in boys with ICLP. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The first, basing on a theory of explicit (declarative, conscious) and implicit (procedural, subconscious) memory aims at reinterpretation of the mechanisms of psychotherapy. This method is useful in analysing effects of cognitive psychotherapy but also psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy which is based on interpretations and insight. The second current in such research is connected with the possibility of neuroimaging, which allows to evaluate changes occurring in the course of therapy. This method enables to show biological mechanisms of therapeutic alliance or reduction of basic anxiety. In the third category of studies, changes in cerebral metabolism that occur due to psychotropic medication and psychotherapy are observed with the aid of neuroimaging. Here, the findings are extremely interesting, for instance, in treatment of depression psychotherapy brings about more specific changes than anti-depression drugs. Most of the investigation is focused on the effects of psychotherapy for patients suffering from depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder because of high homogeneity of these disorders. Schizophrenia-related disorders are less homogeneous, and owing to that drafting a research plan is a much more complicated task.

Furthermore, STC responses to voices change from being less selective and more spatially diffuse in children to highly selective and focal in adults. Interestingly, the analysis of morphological landmarks reveals that inter-subject variability increases during development in the right - but not in the left - STC. Similarly, inter-subject variability of cortically-realigned functional responses to voices, other categories and tones increases with age in the right STC.

It enables the formation of different perceptual representations of the same acoustic input and is at the basis of flexible and goal-dependent behavior. Here, we investigated the role of the human auditory cortex in forming behavior-dependent representations of sounds. We used single-trial fMRI and analyzed cortical responses collected while subjects listened to the same speech sounds (vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/) spoken by different speakers (boy, girl, male) and performed a delayed-match-to-sample task on either speech sound or speaker identity. Univariate analyses showed a task-specific activation increase in the right superior temporal gyrus/sulcus (STG/STS) during speaker categorization and in the right posterior temporal cortex during vowel categorization. Beyond regional differences in activation levels, multivariate classification of single trial responses demonstrated that the success with which single speakers and vowels can be decoded from auditory cortical activation patterns depends on task demands and subject's behavioral performance. Speaker/vowel classification relied on distinct but overlapping regions across the (right) mid-anterior STG/STS (speakers) and bilateral mid-posterior STG/STS (vowels), as well as the superior temporal plane including Heschl's gyrus/sulcus. The task dependency of speaker/vowel classification demonstrates that the informative fMRI response patterns reflect the top-down enhancement of behaviorally relevant sound representations.

Static ultrasound images from 50 patients with periocular haemangiomas were reviewed as identified from a computerised database. Each haemangioma ultrasound image was classified into three categories: (1) preseptal only; (2) preseptal + extraconal; (3) preseptal + extraconal + intraconal. These were compared with the categories given to each patient at first presentation after dynamic scanning. Results: Classification was possible from the static images in 44 (88%) cases. Of those classified 20 (45%) were preseptal only; 17 (39%) were preseptal + extraconal, and seven (16%) had an additional intraconal component. The classification in all 44 cases was the same as that given at the time of presentation. In the small number of cases which went to surgery or had neuroimaging, the ultrasound classification was confirmed. Conclusions: Ultrasound classification was not difficult to perform and no child needed sedation or general anaesthesia for this exam. Ultrasound anatomical classification is an important first step in determining appropriate treatment of periocular haemangiomas. The authors present what they believe to be the first such classification.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Although multiple studies have shown a low likelihood of intracranial infections and abnormal neuroimaging findings among those who present with CFS, the absence of a consensus recommendation and the diversity of CFS presentations (ie, multiple seizures, prolonged seizure, focal seizure) often drive physicians to do a more extensive workup than needed. Few studies examine the factors that influence providers to pursue invasive testing and emergent neuroimaging. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the clinical factors associated with a more extensive workup in a cohort of patients who present to the PED with CFSs. METHODS: Patient visits to a tertiary care PED with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis of CFS were reviewed from April 2009 to November 2011. Patients included were 6 months to 6 years of age. Complex febrile seizures were defined as febrile seizures lasting 15 minutes or longer, more than 1 seizure in 24 hours, and/or a focal seizure. Charts were reviewed for demographics, clinical parameters (duration of fever, history of febrile seizure, focality of seizure, antibiotic use before PED, and immunization status), PED management (antiepileptic drugs given in the PED or by Emergency Medical Services, empiric antibiotics given in the PED, laboratory testing, lumbar puncture, or computed tomography [CT] scan), and results (cultures, laboratories, or imaging). A logistic regression model was created to determine which clinical parameters were associated with diagnostic testing. RESULTS: One hundred ninety patients were diagnosed with CFS and met study criteria. Clinical management in the PED included a lumbar puncture in 37%, blood cultures in 88%, urine cultures in 47%, and a head CT scan in 28%. There were no positive cerebral spinal fluid or blood cultures in this cohort. Of the 90 patients, 4 (4.4%) with urine cultures had a urinary tract infection. Of the 53 patients who had head CT imaging, there were no significant findings that guided therapy. The only factor associated with having a lumbar puncture performed was whether empiric antibiotics were used (odds ratio [OR], 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-6.8). History of a febrile seizure was associated with lower odds of a lumbar puncture (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69). In addition, higher age category was also associated with lower odds of a lumbar puncture (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31-0.91). Those who received an antiepileptic drug had a higher odds of getting a head CT (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5-8.6). Furthermore, patients presenting with a focal seizure also had higher odds of getting a head CT (OR, 4.89; 95% CI, 1.41-16.9). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low utility of associated findings, there are important clinical parameters that are associated with obtaining a lumbar puncture or a head CT as part of the diagnostic workup. National practice parameters to guide evaluation for CFSs in the acute setting are warranted to reduce the amount of invasive testing and imaging.© Copyright 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,2,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In addition, the aim was to develop a method of analysing local scan parameters to enable identification of areas for optimisation. Methods: A retrospective audit of patient records for paediatric CT brain, chest and abdomen/pelvis examinations was undertaken. Demographic information, examination parameters and dose indicators-volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose-length product (DLP)-were collected for 220 patients. LDRLs were derived from mean survey values and the effective dose was estimated from DLP values. The normalised CTDIvol values, mAs values and scan length were analysed to better identify parameters that could be optimised. Results: The LDRLs across all age categories were 18-45 mGy (CTDIvol) and 250-700 mGy cm (DLP) for brain examinations; 3-23 mGy (CTDIvol) and 100-800mGy cm (DLP) for chest examinations; and 4-15mGy (CTDIvol) and 150-750 mGy cm (DLP) for abdomen/pelvis examinations. Effective dose estimates were 1.0-1.6mSv, 1.8-13.0mSv and 2.5-10.0mSv for brain, chest and abdomen/pelvis examinations, respectively. Conclusion: The RCH mean CTDIvol and DLP values are similar to or lower than international DRLs. Use of low-kilovoltage protocols for body imaging in younger patients reduced the dose considerably. There exists potential for optimisation in reducing body scan lengths and justifying the selection of reference mAs values. The assessment method used here proved useful for identifying specific parameters for optimisation. Advances in knowledge: Assessment of individual CT parameters in addition to comparison with DRLs enables identification of specific areas for CT optimisation. © 2012 The British Institute of Radiology.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Other  problematic behaviors may be considered as ""other specified disorders due to  addictive behaviors (6C5Y)."" METHODS: Narrative review, experts' opinions. RESULTS:  We suggest the following meta-level criteria for considering potential addictive  behaviors as fulfilling the category of ""other specified disorders due to addictive  behaviors"":1. Clinical relevance: Empirical evidence from multiple scientific  studies demonstrates that the specific potential addictive behavior is clinically  relevant and individuals experience negative consequences and functional impairments  in daily life due to the problematic and potentially addictive behavior.2.  Theoretical embedding: Current theories and theoretical models belonging to the  field of research on addictive behaviors describe and explain most appropriately the  candidate phenomenon of a potential addictive behavior.3. Empirical evidence: Data  based on self-reports, clinical interviews, surveys, behavioral experiments, and, if  available, biological investigations (neural, physiological, genetic) suggest that  psychological (and neurobiological) mechanisms involved in other addictive behaviors  are also valid for the candidate phenomenon. Varying degrees of support for  problematic forms of pornography use, buying and shopping, and use of social  networks are available. These conditions may fit the category of ""other specified  disorders due to addictive behaviors"". CONCLUSION: It is important not to  over-pathologize everyday-life behavior while concurrently not trivializing  conditions that are of clinical importance and that deserve public health  considerations.

This report describes a newly discovered HSAM case who has extraordinary memory for a wider range of material than has heretofore been described. Method: Subject MM was interviewed about his personal life and administered standard clinical tests of cognition and personality, as well as experimental tasks assessing personal and generic episodic and semantic memory. Finally, he was studied with high resolution structural MRI of the medial temporal lobes, as well as brain connectivity analysis using resting-state functional MRI. Results: MM's ability to recall general factual information, historical facts and dates, sports statistics, and popular culture, as well as personal life experiences, is exceptional, even though he performs in only the average range on tests of intellect and new learning ability. Unlike most mnemonists, he denies using any specific mnemonic strategy and, unlike many other HSAM cases, is unable to recall highly specific details of days in his adult life. Structural brain imaging in MM reveals atypical anatomy in his left temporal lobe, and functional neuroimaging suggests greater than usual connectivity of the left hippocampus with premotor, prefrontal and retrosplenial cingulate cortex. Conclusions: These observations are discussed in the context of previous studies of mnemonists and HSAM cases, some of which implicate hyperconnectivity among components of an expanded memory network in extraordinary memory retrieval. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

They increase the risk of having psychiatric diseases in adulthood and have been considered risk factors for suicidal behavior in all diagnostic categories. Early, prolonged, and severe trauma is also known to increase impulsivity, diminishing the capacity of the brain to inhibit negative actions and to control and modulate emotions. Many neurobiological studies hold that childhood maltreatment may lead to a persistent failure of the inhibitory processes ruled mainly by the frontal cortex over a fear-motivated hyperresponsive limbic system. Multiple neurotransmitters and hormones are involved in the stress response, but, to our knowledge, the two major biological consequences of the chronic exposure to trauma are the hypofunction of the serotonergic system and changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. Some of these findings overlap with the neurobiological features of impulsivity and of suicidal behavior. Impulsivity has also been said to be both a consequence of trauma and a risk factor for the development of a pathological response to trauma. Thus, we suggest that impulsivity could be one of the links between childhood trauma and suicidal behavior. Prevention of childhood abuse could significantly reduce suicidal behavior in adolescents and adults, in part, through a decrease in the frequency of impulsive behaviors in the future. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The present study extends these findings into the domain of second-language (L2) literacy, through brain imaging data of English and Hebrew L2 learners. Participants received an fMRI brain scan, while performing a semantic judgement task on spoken and written words and pseudowords in both their L1 and L2, alongside a battery of L1 and L2 behavioural measures. Imaging results show, overall, a similar network of activation for reading across the two languages, alongside significant convergence of print and speech processing across a network of left-hemisphere regions in both L1 and L2 and in both cohorts. Importantly, convergence is greater for L1 in occipito-temporal regions tied to automatic skilled reading processes including the visual word-form area, but greater for L2 in frontal regions of the reading network, tied to more effortful, active processing. The main groupwise brain effects tell a similar story, with greater L2 than L1 activation across frontal, temporal and parietal regions, but greater L1 than L2 activation in parieto-occipital regions tied to automatic mapping processes in skilled reading. These results provide evidence for the shifting of the reading networks towards more automatic processing as reading proficiency rises and the mappings and statistics of the new orthography are learned and incorporated into the reading system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,23,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

For the identification of endophenotypes across diagnostic categories, further investigations of phenotypic overlap between ADHD and autism at the behavioural, neurocognitive, and brain levels are needed. Methods: We examined regional grey matter differences and similarities in children and adolescents with ASD and ADHD in comparison to healthy controls using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxel-based morphometry. Results: With regard to clinical criteria, the clinical groups did not differ with respect to ADHD symptoms; however, only patients with ASD showed deficits in social communication and interaction, according to parental rating. Structural abnormalities across both clinical groups compared to controls became evident as grey matter reductions in the left medial temporal lobe and as higher grey matter volumes in the left inferior parietal cortex. In addition, autism-specific brain abnormalities were found as increased grey matter volume in the right supramarginal gyrus. Conclusions: While the shared structural deviations in the medial temporal lobe might be attributed to an unspecific delay in brain development and might be associated with memory deficits, the structural abnormalities in the inferior parietal lobe may correspond to attentional deficits observed in both ASD and ADHD. By contrast, the autism-specific grey matter abnormalities near the right temporo-parietal junction may be associated with impaired 'theory of mind' abilities. These findings shed some light on both similarities and differences in the neurocognitive profiles of ADHD and ASD patients. © 2007 The Authors.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,13.3,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of language and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were acquired, For the fMRI, a noun-verb generation task was performed, all images were motion corrected, and activated pixels in classic language areas were counted. The DTI images were acquired in six standard directions with an initial non-diffusion-weighted scan. The ""average anisotropy"" was determined in a region of interest in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and parietal lobe white matter. An asymmetry index (AI) was calculated for language and DTI.

An object decision task, which assessed reaction time facilitation following a semantic or identical prime in comparison to an unrelated prime, was used to investigate whether semantic processing abnormalities could be responsible, in part, for these deficits. Thirty children with vertically acquired HIV infection (M age 9.0 years; range 6-13) participated. Either a picture of the same object (repetition prime), a semantically related object (semantic prime), a semantically unrelated object, or a nonsense object preceded a target picture, which in 50% of the cases was a real object. Brain scans of children were rated and used together with neurobehavioral functioning to classify children as having HIV-related CNS abnormalities (n = 13) or not (n = 17). Increased semantic priming but not repetition priming was associated with a greater degree of cortical atrophy. Furthermore, CNS compromised children had significantly faster reaction times following a semantic prime compared to an unrelated prime than non-compromised patients. This facilitation following semantic priming for the CNS compromised patients (13.3%) almost equaled the facilitation following repetition priming (15.3%) while for the non-compromised patients facilitation following semantic priming (7.9%) was clearly smaller than following repetition priming (14.6%).

We report a follow-up ECoG study in which we contrast forward and reverse speech with a signal-correlated noise (SCN) control task that cannot be perceived as a human voice. Methods: Ten patients were presented 90 audible stimuli, including 30 each of corresponding forward speech, reverse speech, and SCN trials, during ECoG recording with evaluation of gamma activity between 50 and 150.

We participated in the 2011 ADHD-200 Global Competition which involved analyzing a large dataset of 973 participants including Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and healthy controls. Each participant's data included a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan as well as personal characteristic and diagnostic data. The goal was to learn a machine learning classifier that used a participant's resting state fMRI scan to diagnose (classify) that individual into one of three categories: healthy control, ADHD combined (ADHD-C) type, or ADHD inattentive (ADHD-I) type. We used participants' personal characteristic data (site of data collection, age, gender, handedness, performance IQ, verbal IQ, and full scale IQ), without any fMRI data, as input to a logistic classifier to generate diagnostic predictions. Surprisingly, this approach achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (62.52%) as well as the highest score (124 of 195) of any of the 21 teams participating in the competition.

P1 strongly distinguished vowels from tones, revealing larger amplitudes for the more difficult to discriminate but phonetically richer vowel stimuli. Prototypical language phoneme status did not reliably affect AERPs; however P1 amplitudes elicited by the prototypical-vowel correlated robustly with the ability to correctly identify two prototypical-vowels presented in succession as ""same"" (r = -0.70) and word reading fluency (r = -0.63). These negative correlations suggest that smaller P1 amplitudes elicited by the prototypical-vowel predict enhanced accuracy when judging prototypical-vowel ""sameness"" and increased word reading speed. N250 and MMN did not differentiate between vowels and tones and showed no correlations to behavioural measures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,9.2,9,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Methods: All available brain MRIs done for clinical indications on individuals enrolled in a DG natural history study (NCT00313677) were reviewed. Reports were reviewed when MRI was not available. MRIs were categorized as follows: (1) cortical, brainstem, and cerebellar malformations; (2) cortical and cerebellar malformations; or (3) normal. Language development was assigned to 1 of 3 categories by a speech pathologist. Maximal motor function and presence of epilepsy were determined by history or examination. Results: Twenty-five MRIs and 9 reports were reviewed. The most common MRI abnormalities were cobblestone cortex or dysgyria with an anterior-posterior gradient and cerebellar hypoplasia. Seven individuals had MRIs in group 1, 8 in group 2, and 19 in group 3. Language was impaired in 100% of those in MRI groups 1 and 2, and degree of language impairment correlated with severity of imaging. Eighty-five percent of the whole group achieved independent walking, but only 33% did in group 1. Epilepsy was present in 8% of the cohort and rose to 37% of those with an abnormal MRI. Conclusions: Developmental abnormalities of the brain such as cobblestone lissencephaly, cerebellar cysts, pontine hypoplasia, and brainstem bowing are hallmarks of DG and should prompt consideration of these diagnoses. Brain imaging in individuals with DG helps to predict outcomes, especially language development, aiding clinicians in prognostic counseling. © 2017 American Academy of Neurology.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,45,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

How this unique, productive power of human language unfolds over the course of language development is still hotly debated. When they listen to sentences comprising newly-learned words, do children generalize from their knowledge of the legal combinations of word categories or do they instead rely on strings of words stored in memory to detect syntactic errors? Using novel words taught in the lab, we recorded Evoked Response Potentials (ERPs) in two-year-olds and adults listening to grammatical and ungrammatical sentences containing syntactic contexts that had not been used during training. In toddlers, the ungrammatical use of words, even when they have been just learned, induced an early left anterior negativity (surfacing 100-400 ms after target word onset) followed by a late posterior positivity (surfacing 700-900 ms after target word onset) that was not observed in grammatical sentences. This late effect was remarkably similar to the P600 displayed by adults, suggesting that toddlers and adults perform similar syntactic computations. Our results thus show that toddlers build on-line expectations regarding the syntactic category of upcoming words in a sentence. © 2016 The Authors.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,2,2,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

This entails categorizing words into their appropriate word classes. Function words, consistently preceding words from specific categories (e.g., the ballNOUN, I speakVERB), provide invaluable information for this task, and children's sensitivity to such adjacent relationships develops early on in life. However, neighboring words are not the sole source of information regarding an item's word class. Here we examine whether young children also take into account preceding sentence context online during syntactic categorization. To address this question, we use the ambiguous French function word la which, depending on sentence context, can either be used as determiner (the, preceding nouns) or as object clitic (it, preceding verbs). French-learning 18-month-olds’ evoked potentials (ERPs) were recorded while they listened to sentences featuring this ambiguous function word followed by either a noun or a verb (thus yielding a locally felicitous co-occurrence of la + noun or la + verb). Crucially, preceding sentence context rendered the sentence either grammatical or ungrammatical. Ungrammatical sentences elicited a late positivity (resembling a P600) that was not observed for grammatical sentences. Toddlers’ analysis of the unfolding sentence was thus not limited to local co-occurrences, but rather took into account non-adjacent sentence context. These findings suggest that by 18 months of age, online word categorization is already surprisingly robust. This could be greatly beneficial for the acquisition of novel words. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,1,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Maturational changes in brain and social development make adolescence an ideal time to reexamine associations. The objective was to conduct a systematic review of published studies examining associations between PCE and adolescent development (behavior, cognition/school outcomes, physiologic responses, and brain morphology/functioning). METHODS: Articles were obtained from PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases through July 2012 with search terms: prenatal drug, substance, or cocaine exposure; adolescence/adolescent; and in utero substance/drug exposure. Criteria for inclusion were nonexposed comparison group, human adolescents aged 11 to 19, peer-reviewed, English-language, and adolescent outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies representing 9 cohorts met the criteria. Four outcome categories were identified: behavior, cognition/school performance, brain structure/function, and physiologic responses. Eleven examined behavior; 7 found small but significant differences favoring nonexposed adolescents, with small effect sizes. Eight examined cognition/school performance; 6 reported significantly lower scores on language and memory tasks among adolescents with PCE, with varying effect sizes varied. Eight examined brain structure/function and reported morphologic differences with few functional differences. Three examined physiologic responses with discordant findings. Most studies controlled for other prenatal exposures, caregiving environment, and violence exposure; few examined mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with findings among younger children, PCE increases the risk for small but significantly less favorable adolescent functioning. Although the clinical importance of differences is often unknown, the caregiving environment and violence exposure pose additional threats. Future research should investigate mechanisms linking PCE with adolescent functioning.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether this phenomenon is associated with age-related reductions in face specificity in brain activity and whether older adults compensate for these face-processing deficiencies by increasing activity in other areas within the face-processing network, or outside this network. A comparison of brain activity across multiple stimulus categories showed that, unlike young adults who engaged a number of brain regions specific to face processing, older adults generalized these patterns of activity to objects and houses. Also, young adults showed functional connectivity between the right FG and its homologous region during face processing, whereas older adults did not engage the left FG but showed a functional connection between the right FG and left orbitofrontal cortex. Finally, this frontotemporal functional connection was activated more strongly in older adults who performed better on a face-matching task (done outside of the scanner), suggesting increased involvement of this functional link for successful face recognition with increasing age.

We argued that the temporal element within spatiotemporal should be the order/simultaneity of the event elements, but that it is not clear whether the spatial content should be egocentric or allocentric. We also argued that episodic recollection should be configural (tending towards all-or-nothing recall of the WWW elements). Our first deferred imitation experiment, using a two-dimensional (2D) display, produced superior-to-chance performance after 2.5 years but no evidence of configural memory. Moreover, performance did not differ from that on a What–What–What control task. Our second deferred imitation study required the children to reproduce actions on an object in a room, thereby affording layout-based spatial cues. In this case, not only was there superior-to-chance performance after 2.5 years but memory was also configural at both ages.

Therefore, we aimed to characterize and compare experiences of providers and parents of children with CP with regards to early detection and intervention. Method: Seventeen parents participated in day-long world-café style workshops focused on categories extracted from the International Classification of Function framework and recent systematic reviews of early detection for CP. Thirty regional providers (generalists, specialists, and therapists) caring for infants with CP completed surveys with scaled score and open-ended questions. Quantitative and qualitative data were independently assessed by two reviewers to identify prominent themes. Results: All parents (100%) stated early diagnosis or high risk for CP classification was beneficial compared with only 50% of providers who often gave early CP diagnoses before 12 months. Top parent priorities were honesty and positively phrased messages. Providers most often addressed cognition, primary care need, motor, and feeding issues (80%, 62%, 54%, 54% frequently/sometimes). Matching priorities for discussion were neuroimaging timing/risk/benefit, cognition, primary care, motor, and feeding/nutrition. Discordance occurred for participation, parent well-being, pain and vision, with parents wanting more education and resources. Conclusions: Receiving early diagnoses or high-risk for CP classification is a parent priority.

The neurological concept of learning is approached from a cybernetic point of view, taking into account that a child should recognize a fact, learn it semantically and decide whether it is worth storing; the dynamic aspect of memory is the true motor of the ability to learn and all this is modulated by the attention factor. Development The neurological evaluation of learning disorders is based on clinical examination which includes the so-called minor signs of the noetic functions, specifically language, the praxes, gnosias, perceptive-motor function, laterality and the lexical, graphic and calculation functions together with the modulating element, mentioned above, of the level of attention with or without hyperactivity. These semiological elements are grouped into three major categories of syndromes, motor syndrome, dyslexic-dysgraphic-dyscalculation syndrome and the hyperkinetic syndrome or attention deficit with hyperactivity. We also note the differential diagnosis. We review the neurophysiological biological markers (EEG and brain mapping, cerebral evoked potentials, neurometry) and those based on neuroimaging techniques (cerebral CT, MR, SPECT and PET).

PATIENTS: Fifteen pediatric subjects, all implanted with a CII-Bionic Ear or a HiRes90K. INTERVENTIONS: NRI was measured on 4 electrodes intraoperatively at first fitting and after 3, 6, and 12 months of use. eSRT recordings were performed intraoperatively with SoundWave speech bursts. Subjects were fitted using the SoundWave defaults. Relationships between NRI thresholds (tNRI), eSRT, and most comfortable levels (M) are presented. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraoperative eSRT, and intraoperative and postoperative tNRI at each fitting session. Auditory performance measured by Categories of Auditory Performance and Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale. RESULTS: First fitting Ms are 97% of intraoperative tNRI; stable Ms (12 months of implant use) are equal to 115% of 12 months' tNRI and to 76% of intraoperative eSRT on average across the electrode array with great intersubject variability.

"Canitano, Roberto",2011,databases,Neurological assessment,Textbook of autism spectrum disorders.,NaN,"A number of neurological symptoms and disorders should be adequately evaluated in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) because they occur relatively frequently. Some belong to the category of the so-called soft signs and are detected by means of a thorough clinical evaluation in which the clinician looks for subtle dysfunctional signs. Others are more classic neurological disorders that need to be described in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the associated symptoms. An accurate standardized neurological evaluation, including muscle tone, gait, dominance and laterality, handedness, motor skills, praxis, and coordination in fine motor activities, is necessary for defining neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Two classes of soft signs have been recognized: mild but classic neurological signs such as ataxia, hypotonia, asymmetry in muscle tone, and deficits in sensorimotor function, and developmental soft signs, which refer to sensorimotor functions that reflect a delay in maturation (Mandelbaum et al. 2006). Epilepsy and movement disorders, however, are additional disorders—recognized as such—that need to be addressed and have important implications at both the clinical and etiological levels. In the current classification, epilepsy is listed as an associated symptom, whereas movement disorders have not been addressed in the current nosology. Current knowledge of the neurobiological basis of ASDs has contributed to the etiological factors that could be involved in additional neurological symptoms. Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated abnormalities in the dendritic tree outgrowth and pruning, in the synaptic connections, and in the development of neural fibers that may constitute the neurofunctional substrate for these neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Therefore, soft signs might be viewed as abnormalities unfolding throughout the complex neural network of brain development in autism, and the etiology of specific conditions, such as epilepsy, is still poorly understood. An overview of the main neurological signs, symptoms, and disorders in ASDs is herein provided. Neurological signs and symptoms in autism spectrum disorders should be routinely investigated with a developmental clinical approach. Hypotonia is a common finding, because head enlargement is evident in approximately 20% of individuals. In addition, dyspraxia, an impairment of motor sequences learning, is another common finding. Other types of sensorimotor deficits are detected in children with ASDs when standardized clinical examinations are performed. As to specific neurological disorders, epilepsy is known to affect a considerable proportion of children and adolescents with ASDs. There are two peak age risks for seizure onset: early childhood and adolescence. Any kind of seizure may be observed in ASDs. Current knowledge of the etiology and possible influence of epilepsy on ASDs is poorly known. Movement disorders are not rare and often go unnoticed because they overlap with the repetitive movements and typical behaviors of ASDs. Tics and Tourette's syndrome should be systematically examined, and catatonia and catatonia-like states have been reported; these additional symptoms warrant specific attention. Standardized assessment for movement disorders and dyskinesia is needed to further improve the diagnostic yield. The many neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms that add to and/or overlap with the core symptoms of ASDs are still not precisely defined, and their boundaries will be more thoroughly described as soon as future research addresses the domain of these additional symptoms. The identification of clinical subgroups of ASD according to associated symptoms is expected to improve treatment approach and is awaited.

An orthographic judgment task required participants to determine if two sequentially presented spoken words had the same spelling for the rime. Four lexical conditions were designed: similar orthography and phonology (O+P+), similar orthography but different phonology (O+P-), similar phonology but different orthography (O-P+), and different orthography and phonology (O-P-). In left superior temporal gyrus, there was lower activation for targets in O+P+ than for those in O-P- and higher accuracy was correlated with stronger activation across all lexical conditions. These results provide evidence for phonological priming in children and greater elaboration of phonological representations in higher skill children, respectively. In left fusiform gyrus, there was lower activation for targets in O+P+ and O+P- than for those in O-P-, suggesting that visual similarity resulted in orthographic priming even with only auditory input. In left middle temporal gyrus, there was lower activation for targets in O+P+ than all other lexical conditions, suggesting that converging orthographic and phonological information resulted in a weaker influence on semantic representations. In addition, higher reading skill was correlated with weaker activation in left middle temporal gyrus across all lexical conditions, suggesting that higher skill children rely to a lesser degree on semantics as a compensatory mechanism. Finally, conflict effects but not priming effects were observed in left inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting that this region is involved in resolving conflicting orthographic and phonological information but not in perceptual priming. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,12.2,15,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Since DSM-III reorganized the definition of mood disorders, bipolar was meant to clarify course (someone with bipolar disorder presumably had at least one lifetime manic episode). However, being 'bipolar' has come to be synonymous with 'manic,' and, ironically, it is difficult to know whether a patient who has bipolar disorder is having his or her lifetime characterized (i.e., no current problem but history of mania) or a current state identified and if that current state is a manic, depressive, hypomaniac, or depressed episode.

Little is known about the patterns of fMR imaging  activation associated with various pathological lesions in that region or their  relation to motor skills before surgical intervention. METHODS: Twenty-two control  volunteers and 44 patients whose pathologies included arteriovenous malformations  (AVMs; 16 patients), congenital cortical abnormalities (11 patients), and tumors (17  patients) were studied using fMR imaging and a hand motor task paradigm. Activation  maps were constructed for each participant, and changes in position or amplitude of  the motor activation on the lesion side were compared with the activation pattern  obtained in the contralateral hemisphere. A classification scheme of plasticity  (Grades 1-6) based on interhemispheric pixel asymmetry and displacement of  activation was used to compare maps between patients, and relative to hand motor  dexterity and/or weakness. There was 89.4% interobserver agreement on classification  of patterns of fMR imaging activation. Displacement of activation by mass effect was  more likely with tumors. Cortical malformations offer a much higher functional  reorganization than AVMs or tumors. High-grade plasticity is recruited to compensate  for severe motor impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Pattern modification of fMR imaging  activation can be systematized in a classification of motor cortex plasticity. This  classification has shown good correlation among grading, brain lesions, and motor  skills. This proposal of a classification scheme, in addition to facilitating data  collection and processing from different institutions, is well suited for comparing  risks associated with surgical intervention and patterns of functional recovery in  relation to preoperative fMR imaging categorization. Such studies are underway at  the authors' institution.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Study of these cases is informative about the injuries likely to occur in these falls. Most often, only a minor contact injury such as scalp bruise or laceration results. In a 2 to 3% of falls, a simple linear skull fracture occurs and the majority of these are uneventful in terms of neurological deficit or intracranial bleeding. In about 1% of the fractures, an epidural or subdural hemorrhage occurs. Each of these forms of contact hemorrhages will be discussed and illustrated.

This study aims to determine the utility of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in predicting clinical response in patients with low-grade glioma at multiple institutions. Materials and methods: Sixty-nine patients were studied with dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI at two institutions. The pathologic diagnoses of the low-grade gliomas were 34 astrocytomas, 20 oligodendroglioma, 9 oligoastrocytomas, 1 ganglioglioma and 5 with indeterminate histology. Wilcoxon tests were used to compare patients in different response categories with respect to baseline rCBV. Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank tests were used to predict the association of rCBV with time to progression. Results: At both institutions, patients with an adverse event (progressive disease or death) had a significantly higher baseline rCBV than those without (complete response or stable disease) (p value = 0.0138). The odds ratio for detecting an adverse event when using rCBV was 1.87 (95% confidence interval: 1.14-3.08). rCBV was significantly negatively associated with time to progression (p = 0.005). The median time to progression among subjects with rCBV > 1.75 was 365 days, while there was 95% confidence that the median time to progression was at least 889 days among subjects with rCBV < 1.75. Conclusion: Our study suggests not only that rCBV measurements correlate well with time to progression or death, but also that the findings can be replicated across institutions, which supports the application of rCBV as an adjunct to pathology in predicting glioma biology. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to offer an update on the anatomofunctional bases of language and the theories that explain its normal and pathological development. Method. Language is a clear example of one of the higher functions of the brain, the development of which is carried out, on the one hand, in a genetically determined anatomofunctional structure and, on the other hand, by the verbal stimulus provided by the environment. Several systems and subsystems are at play within the anatomofunctional structure and these operate in series and in parallel. A large amount of the knowledge we have about the neurophysiological bases of language come from observations carried out in adult patients with circumscribed lesions and their clinical consequences (aphasias). Findings from recent studies involving functional imaging in volunteers submitted to linguistic tests have added more data. According to Damasio, three functional systems are at work in language: 1. The instrumental system, which corresponds to the perisylvian region of the dominant hemisphere where phonological processing takes place; 2. The mediation system, which includes temporal, frontal and parietal areas that surround the anterior region and are where lexical items are organised in a modular fashion, in terms of categories, actions and functional or connecting words; 3. The semantic system, which includes extensive areas of the cortex in both hemispheres and is the seat of concepts and meanings. Throughout a child's development, the evolution he or she follows to reach the neurolinguistic organisation of the adult brain requires the integrity and proper functioning of these structures that are for the most part located in the dominant hemisphere. We review the different theories that appear in the specialised literature concerning the causes and fisiopathogenic mechanisms behind dysphasias in early childhood. Conclusions. Among the numerous functions that take part in the complex language system, some are essential for its normal development. From the work of Tallal et al. it has been seen that the sequential and fast phonological processing of consonant-vowel shifts is altered in dysphasic and dyslexic children. This finding is related with the disorders in the normal asymmetry of the temporal planum (the left is larger than the right) that has been observed in these patients and with the neuropathological findings of Galaburda et al. in dyslexic patients who had previously been dysphasic, in whom cytoarchitectural anomalies (heterotopias) were found, above all in the left perisylvian region. Obviously not all forms of dysphasia are the result of this alteration. According to Chevrie-Muller's classical chartadapted by us in accordance with Damasio's scheme - it is possible to locate the dysphasic syndromes in different loci and distinguish a different physiopathological mechanism for each of them.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The development in children and adolescents of successful memory encoding for scenes has been associated with increased activation in PFC, but not MTL, regions. However, evidence suggests that a functional subregion of the MTL that supports scene perception, located in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), goes through a prolonged maturation process. Here we tested the hypothesis that maturation of scene perception supports the development of memory for complex scenes. Scenes were characterized by their levels of complexity defi ned by the number of unique object categories depicted in the scene. Recognition memory improved with age, in participants ages 8-24, for high-, but not low-, complexity scenes. High-complexity compared to low-complexity scenes activated a network of regions including the posterior PHG. The difference in activations for high- versus low-complexity scenes increased with age in the right posterior PHG. Finally, activations in right posterior PHG were associated with age-related increases in successful memory formation for high-, but not low-, complexity scenes. These results suggest that functional maturation of the right posterior PHG plays a critical role in the development of enduring long-term recollection for high-complexity scenes. © 2010 Chai, Ofen, Jacobs and Gabrieli.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,24,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

One of the principal mechanisms controlling urine output is vasopressin which is released from the posterior pituitary gland and enhances water reabsorption from the renal collecting duct. In diabetes insipidus, the excessive production of dilute urine, and the causes of this clinical picture can be divided into three main groups: the first is primary polydipsia where the amount of fluid ingested is inappropriately large; the second group is cranial diabetes insipidus where the production of vasopressin is abnormally low; and, the third group is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus where the kidney response to vasopressin is impaired. The history and examination may suggest an underlying explanation for diabetes insipidus but a range of baseline and more extensive investigations may be required before a diagnosis can be reached. These investigations are not without risk, and the results need to be interpreted carefully because children do not always segregate neatly into a particular diagnostic category on the basis of one test alone. Children with cranial diabetes insipidus typically respond to arginine vasopressin or its manufactured analogue, desmopressin, with an increase in urine osmolality and an associated reduction in urine output. Such children usually require neuroimaging to look for evidence of evolving CNS pathology, such as an intracranial tumour. Vasopressin 'replacement' with desmopressin is the treatment of choice in patients with cranial diabetes insipidus although extreme caution is required when treating babies or small children because of the danger of fluid overload. Abnormal production of other pituitary hormones in children with CNS disease can also influence fluid balance. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be due to abnormal electrolyte concentrations, therefore these should be measured as part of the initial assessment. In a small number of children the defect is a primary abnormality of the vasopressin receptor or one of the water channel proteins (aquaporins) involved in water transport. The treatment of these patients is difficult and typically involves therapy with a diuretic such as chlorothiazide, as well as indomethacin. These agents enhance urine osmolality by their effect on circulating volume and renal solute and water handling. The fluid intake of most young children with primary polydipsia can be safely reduced to a more appropriate level.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We aimed to examine age-dependent neural correlates of semantic processing in boys with ASD as compared to typically developing boys (TD). We used functional MRI to investigate 37 boys with ASD (mean age = 13.3 years, standard deviation = 2.4) and 35 age-, sex-, Intelligence quotient (IQ)- and handedness-matched TD boys (mean age = 13.3 years, standard deviation = 2.7) from age 8 to 18 years. Participants had to indicate whether pairs of Chinese characters presented visually were related in meaning. Group (ASD, TD) × Age (Old, Young) ANOVA was used to examine the difference of age-related changes. Direct comparisons between the adolescent group and the child group were also performed. The behavioral results showed that the ASD group had lower accuracy in the related condition relative to the TD group. The neuroimaging results showed greater activation in the cuneus and less activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in boys with ASD than TD boys. Children with ASD produced greater activation in the cuneus than TD children. Adolescents with ASD showed reduced left IFG activation as compared to TD adolescents. Our findings suggest that TD boys may engage more in higher-level processing of retrieving or selecting semantic features while boys with ASD may rely more on lower-level visual processing during semantic judgments.

Study Design Children and adults (n=6) listened to different categories of speech stimuli or rested across trials during silent intervals of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. Stimuli including natural speech and speech signals processed to simulate a CI with eight spectral channels were presented. FMRI was performed on a 3.0-T MRI scanner using an acquisition method referred to as Hemodynamics Unrelated to Scanner Hardware (HUSH)-fMRI here. Auditory stimulation during silent intervals of the fMRI scans alternated with MR image acquisition on each trial. Trials from different experimental conditions were grouped, averaged, and analysed. Results Natural speech signals evoked robust cortical activation bilaterally relative to rest in all subjects. This brain activation pattern overlapped substantially with that evoked by CI speech, such that CI speech stimuli that were intelligible evoked brain activation patterns that were similar to natural speech. CI-speech intelligibility during fMRI acquisition was comparable to that observed outside of the scanner, suggesting minimal interference due to acoustic noise from the scanner.

One phenomenon in this context is the congruency sequence-(Gratton effect), for which different theoretical explanations have been put forward. A critical aspect that differs between these explanations is the expectancy of what will happen in forthcoming trials. In the current study we examine the relevance of expectancy for sequence congruency effects and related neurophysiological processes using a flanker task in which we manipulate the probability that the n +1 trial presents the same stimulus–response mapping than the n trial. We ask what cognitive subprocesses involved in response selection may be modulated by expectancy effects. To distinguish different subprocesses probably modulated by expectancy effects we use event-related potentials (ERPs) in combination with source localization techniques. The data show that cognitive subprocesses modulated by expectancy depend on the nature of expected transitions between succeeding trials. Expectancy effects only affected trial transitions within the same category (i.e., ‘compatible-compatible’ and ‘incompatible-incompatible’), but not between compatibility categories (i.e., ‘compatible-incompatible’ and ‘incompatible-compatible’). On compatible trial transitions attentional selection processes operating via the precuneus mediated expectancy effects, while on incompatible trial transitions inhibitory processes were modulated that were mediated via the medial and middle frontal gyrus, the orbitofrontal cortex, the insular and the parahippocampal gyrus. Conflict monitoring processes per se were not modulated by expectancy effects. The data shows that there are different subprocesses underlying the influence of expectancy on sequence effects during response selection.

Thus we systematically reviewed the available literature to determine the changes in brain biochemical composition from fetus to older age and tried to explain them in the context of neural, cognitive, and behavioural changes. Methods: The search identified 1262 articles regarding proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) examinations through December 2017. The following data was extracted: age range of the subjects, number of subjects studied, brain regions studied, MRS sequence used, echo time, MR system, method of statistical analysis, metabolites analyzed, significant differences in metabolites concentrations with age as well as the way of presentation of the results. Results: 82 studies that described brain metabolite changes with age were identified. Reports on metabolic changes related to healthy aging were analyzed and discussed among six basic age groups: fetuses, infants, children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly as well as between groups and during the whole lifetime. Discussion: The results presented in the reviewed papers provide evidence that normal aging is associated with a number of metabolic changes characteristic for every period of life.

We investigated the basis of this apparent contradiction using a complex object working memory task, a Categorical n-back (CN-BT). We examined whether the neural networks engaged by the CN-BT in children consist of the same brain regions as those in adults, but with a different magnitude of activation, or whether the networks are qualitatively different. Event-related fMRI was used to study differences in brain activation between healthy children ages 6 and 10 years, and young adults (20-28 years). Performance accuracy and RTs in 10-year-olds and adults were comparable, but the performance in 6-year-olds was lower. In adults, the CN-BT was highly effective in engaging the bilateral (L > R) ventral prefrontal cortex, the bilateral fusiform gyrus, posterior cingulate and precuneus, thus suggesting an involvement of the ventral visual stream, with related feature extraction and semantic labeling strategies. In children, the brain networks were distinctly different. They involved the premotor and parietal cortex, anterior insula, caudate/putamen, and the cerebellum, thus suggesting a predominant involvement of the visual dorsal and sensory-motor pathways, with related visual-spatial and action cognitive strategies. The findings indicate engagement of developmental networks in children reflecting task-effective brain activation. The age-related pattern of fMRI activation suggests a working hypothesis of a developmental shift from reliance on the dorsal visual stream and premotor/striatal/cerebellar networks in young children to reliance on the ventral prefrontal and inferior temporal networks in adults. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) permits an optimal differentiation of brain tissue and of its abnormalities, without resorting to ionizing radiation or intravenous contrast. It is particularly appropriate for following the evolution of leukomalacia, after fontanel closure. Ninety-five fullterm and preterm infants with cystic and non-cystic leukomalacia, documented by US, were clinically followed-up until at least 12 months of corrected age. Thirty-two had a severe neurological outcome (mainly cerebral palsy, sometimes associated with mental retardation and/or cerebral visual impairment). The prognosis was worse in cystic leukomalacia than in prolonged flare. Electroencephalogram (EEG) carried out in the first 2 weeks of life provided valuable indexes of further outcome, especially for US findings of more uncertain prognosis. MRI was carried out at around 12 months of corrected age, by means of an apparatus operating at 0.5 Tesla. The main categories of abnormalities observed were the following: cystic lesions, enlarged ventricles with irregular outlines, delayed myelination, high intensity areas in the long TR (repetition time) images within the white matter, cortical atrophy. MRI findings correlated well with the results of US imaging and often with motor, cognitive and visual impairments. Nevertheless, clinical features cannot be predicted by neuroimaging alone and a comprehensive approach, including longitudinal functional and electrophysiological testing, is highly recommended. © 1992 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

There have been notably limited investigations linking these previous node-specific findings into larger-scale network models of brain organization. Method To address these gaps, we applied graph theoretical analyses to fMRI data collected during a facial emotion processing task among 88 adolescent girls (n = 59 exposed to direct physical or sexual assault; n = 29 healthy controls), aged 11–17, during fMRI. Large-scale organization indices of modularity, assortativity, and global efficiency were calculated for stimulus-specific functional connectivity using an 883 region-of-interest parcellation. Results Among the entire sample, more severe early life trauma was associated with more modular and assortative, but less globally efficient, network organization across all stimulus categories. Among the assaulted girls, severity of early life trauma and PTSD diagnoses were both simultaneously related to increased modular brain organization. We also found that more modularized network organization was related both to amygdala hyperactivation and weakened connectivity between amygdala and medial PFC. Conclusions These results demonstrate that early life trauma is associated with enhanced brain organization during facial emotion processing and that this pattern of brain organization might explain the commonly observed association between childhood trauma and amygdala hyperactivity and weakened connectivity with mPFC. Implications of these results for neurocircuitry models are discussed. © 2017 The Authors",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,15,17,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

METHODS: The institutional review board approved this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study. A prospective PET database of patients referred for PNS between 2001 and 2010 was queried retrospectively and identified 102 patients who met the diagnostic criteria for PNS, had PET brain imaging, and lacked clinical or MRI evidence of an alternative diagnosis.Qualitative and semiquantitative evaluation of brain metabolism was obtained by 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projection and region-based analysis. Qualitative and semiquantitative assessment was performed blinded to clinical data. RESULTS: PET/CT demonstrated that 67 patients had abnormal brain glucose metabolism. Six categories of brain hypometabolism were identified: diffuse (36/67), cerebellar (10/67), basal ganglia (10/67), frontal (9/67), temporal (1/67), and occipital (1/67). The mean Z score of the cerebral cortex in diffuse hypometabolism was 1.65 (range, 0.25-3.46). For cerebellar hypometabolism, the mean Z score of the cerebellum was 2.31 (range, 0.52-4.54). In basal ganglia hypometabolism, the mean Z score was 2.53 (range, 1.78-3.89), and in frontal lobe hypometabolism, the mean Z score was 2.11 (range, 1.39-4.45). The majority (39/67, 62.9%) with abnormal glucose metabolism on PET had a normal MR. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PNS frequently have abnormal brain metabolism on semiquantitative PET/CT. With semiquantitative analysis, we defined 6 common patterns of abnormalities, which often correlated with clinical symptoms. Both qualitative and semiquantitative analyses of brain glucose metabolism may be helpful in evaluating PNS, especially in patients with a normal MRI.

We used the N400 component of the event-related potential waveform to investigate the development of single word processing across the upper elementary years, in comparison to adult readers. We presented third graders, fourth graders, fifth graders, and college students with a well-controlled list of real words, pseudowords, letter strings, false font strings, and animal name targets. Words and pseudowords elicited similar N400s across groups. False font strings elicited N400s similar to words and letter strings in the three groups of children, but not in college students. The pattern of findings suggests relatively adult-like semantic and phonological processing by third grade, but a long developmental time course, beyond fifth grade, for orthographic processing in this context. Thus, the amplitude of the N400 elicited by various word-like stimuli does not reflect some sort of shift or discontinuity in word processing around the fourth grade. However, the results do suggest different developmental time courses for the processes that contribute to automatic single word reading and the integrative N400. In a developmental event-related potential study investigating the putative fourth grade shift in reading, the amplitude of the N400 component elicited by various word-like stimuli did not reflect a shift or discontinuity in word processing around the fourth grade.

In adults, N1 was larger to and P2 was later to words as compared to pseudowords, a finely tuned effect of lexicality reflecting specialization for word processing. In contrast, in each group of children, N1 was larger to letter strings than false font strings and P2 was larger to false font strings than letter strings, reflecting coarse encoding for orthography. In regression analyses, scores on standardized behavioral test measures of orthographic knowledge, decoding skill, and fluency predicted N1 amplitude; these effects were not significant with age included as a separate predictor. None of the behavioral scores, in models including or not including age, predicted P2 amplitude. In direct comparisons between groups, there were multiple differences between the child and adult groups for both N1 and P2 amplitude effects, and only a single significant difference between two child groups.

Using functional resting state magnetic resonance images, we performed whole-brain analysis of the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), to detect areas of spontaneous blood oxygenation level dependent signal across brain regions. We compared the ALFF of 20 SCD patients to that observed in 19 healthy, age and ethnicity-matched, control subjects. Significant differences were found in several brain regions, including the insula, precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex and medial superior frontal gyrus. To identify the ALFF differences resulting from anemia alone, we also compared the ALFF of SCD patients to that observed in 12 patients having comparable hemoglobin levels but lacking sickle hemoglobin. Increased ALFF in the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and decreased ALFF in the frontal pole, cerebellum and medial superior frontal gyrus persisted after accounting for the effect of anemia. The presence of white matter hyperintensities was associated with depressed frontal and medial superior frontal gyri activity in the SCD subjects. Decreased ALFF in the frontal lobe was correlated with decreased verbal fluency and cognitive flexibility.

Several behavioral studies have suggested the presence of anomalies at an early stage of phoneme processing, when the complex spectrotemporal patterns in the speech signal are analyzed and assigned to phonemic categories. In this study, fMRI was used to compare brain responses associated with categorical discrimination of speech syllables (P) and acoustically matched nonphonemic stimuli (N) in children and adolescents with dyslexia and in typically developing (TD) controls, aged 8–17 years. The TD group showed significantly greater activation during the P condition relative to N in an area of the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex that corresponds well with the region referred to as the “visual word form area” (VWFA). Regression analyses using reading performance as a continuous variable across the full group of participants yielded similar results. Overall, the findings are consistent with those of previous neuroimaging studies using print stimuli in individuals with dyslexia that found reduced activation in left occipitotemporal regions; however, the current study shows that these activation differences seen during reading are apparent during auditory phoneme discrimination in youth with dyslexia, suggesting that the primary deficit in at least a subset of children may lie early in the speech processing stream and that categorical perception may be an important target of early intervention in children at risk for dyslexia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,17,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

As a group, children showed activation in the left superior/middle temporal gyri (BA 22, 21), right middle temporal gyrus (BA 21), dorsal (BA 45, pars opercularis) and ventral (BA 46, pars triangularis) aspects of the left inferior frontal gyrus, and left fusiform gyrus (BA 37). There was a developmental increase in activation in the left middle temporal gyrus (BA 22) across all lexical conditions, suggesting that automatic semantic processing increases with age regardless of task demands. Activation in the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus also showed developmental increases for the conflicting (e.g. PINT-MINT) compared to the non-conflicting (e.g. PRESS-LIST) non-rhyming conditions, indicating that this area becomes increasingly involved in strategic phonological processing in the face of conflicting orthographic and phonological representations. Left inferior temporal/fusiform gyrus (BA 37) activation was also greater for the conflicting (e.g. PINT-MINT) condition, and a developmental increase was found in the positive relationship between individuals' reaction time and activation in the left lingual/fusiform gyrus (BA 18) in this condition, indicating an age-related increase in the association between longer reaction times and greater visual-orthographic processing in this conflicting condition. These results suggest that orthographic processing is automatically engaged by children in a task that does not require access to orthographic information for correct performance, especially when orthographic and phonological representations conflict, and especially for longer response latencies in older children. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Even less is understood about the effect of early hippocampal damage on children's memory and imagination abilities. To bridge this gap, we devised a novel naturalistic autobiographical memory task that enabled us to formally assess the memory for recent autobiographical experiences in healthy school-aged children. Contemporaneous with the autobiographical memories being formed, the children also imagined and described fictitious scenarios. Having established the performance of healthy school-aged children on these tasks, we proceeded to make comparisons with children (n= 21) who had experienced neonatal hypoxia/ischaemia, and consequent bilateral hippocampal damage. Our results showed that healthy children could recall autobiographical events, including spatiotemporal information and specific episodic details. By contrast, children who had experienced neonatal hypoxia/ischaemia had impaired recall, with the specific details of episodes being lost. Despite this significant memory deficit they were able to construct fictitious scenarios. This is in clear contrast to adults with hippocampal damage, who typically have impaired autobiographical memory and deficits in the construction of fictitious and future scenarios. We speculate that the paediatric patients' relatively intact semantic memory and/or some functionality in their residual hippocampi may underpin their scene construction ability. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,12.33,15,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Here, we used novel meta-analytic data-driven approaches to characterize the function and connectivity profile of ADHD-related dysfunctional regions consistently detected across studies. Methods: We first conducted an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 24 task-based fMRI studies in adults with ADHD. Each ADHD-related dysfunctional region resulting from the activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was then analyzed using functional decoding based on ~7500 fMRI experiments in the BrainMap database. This approach allows mapping brain regions to functions not necessarily tested in individual studies, thus suggesting possible novel functions for those regions. Additionally, ADHD-related dysfunctional regions were clustered based on their functional coactivation profiles across all the experiments stored in BrainMap (meta-analytic connectivity modeling). Results: ADHD-related hypoactivation was found in the left putamen, left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), left temporal pole, and right caudate. Functional decoding mapped the left putamen to cognitive aspects of music perception/reproduction and the left temporal lobe to language semantics; both these regions clustered together on the basis of their meta-analytic functional connectivity. Left inferior gyrus mapped to executive function tasks; right caudate mapped to both executive function tasks and music-related processes. Conclusions: Our study provides meta-analytic support to the hypothesis that, in addition to well-known deficits in typical executive functions, impairment in processes related to music perception/reproduction and language semantics may be involved in the pathophysiology of adult ADHD.

A subset of left hemisphere (LH) language areas activated when participants watched an audio-visual narrative in their mother tongue was activated when they observed a signed narrative. The inferior frontal (IFG) and precentral (Prec) gyri, the posterior parts of the planum temporale (pPT) and of the superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and the occipito-temporal junction (OTJ) were activated by both languages. The activity of these regions was not related to the presence of communicative intent because no such changes were observed when the non-signers watched a muted video of a spoken narrative. Recruitment was also not triggered by the linguistic structure of SL, because the areas, except pPT, were not activated when subjects listened to an unknown spoken language. The comparison of brain reactivity for spoken and sign languages shows that SL has a special status in the brain compared to speech; in contrast to unknown oral language, the neural correlates of SL overlap LH speech comprehension areas in non-signers. These results support the idea that strong relationships exist between areas involved in human action observation and language, suggesting that the observation of hand gestures have shaped the lexico-semantic language areas as proposed by the motor theory of speech.

All participants in every groups did have normal general intelligence and attention. Both clinical groups had, as another clinical consequence, spastic cerebral palsy (diplegia). Neuropsychological exam consisted on tests of general intelligence, attentional abilities, declarative memory and semantic knowledge. All participants had a brain magnetic resonance image and spectroscopy of hippocampi. Scheltens criteria were used for visual estimation of hippocampal atrophy. Parametric and non-parametric statistical contrasts were made. Results. Despite preservation of semantic and procedural learning, declarative-episodic memory is impaired in the first group versus the other two groups.

Brain regions activated in response to a cognitive flexibility task in adults were used to guide region-of-interest selection to estimate individual connectivity profiles in this study. We expected to find subgroups of children who differed in their network connectivity metrics and symptom measures. Unexpectedly, we did not find a stable or valid subgrouping solution, which suggests that categorical models of the neural substrates of cognitive flexibility in children may be invalid. Exploratory analyses revealed dimensional associations between network connectivity metrics and ADHD symptomatology and EF ability across the entire sample. Results shed light on the validity of conceptualizing the neural substrates of cognitive flexibility categorically in children.

Results: No significant group differences in within- or between-network functional connectivity were observed between traditional diagnostic categories (ASD, ADHD, TD) even when stratified by comorbidity (ASD + ADHD, ASD, ADHD, TD). Similarly, subgroups classified by executive functioning levels showed no group differences. Conclusions: Using clinical diagnosis and behavioral measures of executive function, no differences in functional connectivity were observed among the categories examined. Despite our limited ability to detect small- to medium-sized differences between groups, this work contributes to a growing literature suggesting that traditional diagnostic categories do not define neurobiologically separable groups. Future work is necessary to ascertain the validity of the executive function-based nosology, but current results suggest that nosologies reliant on behavioral data alone may not lead to discovery of neurobiologically distinct categories. © 2019 The Authors",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,10.5,13,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

For example, a child may acquire the rule ''If it has wings, then it is a bird,'' but then must account for exceptions to this rule, such as bats. The current study explored the neurobiological basis of rule-plus-exception learning by using quantitative predictions from a category learning model, SUSTAIN, to analyze behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. SUSTAIN predicts that exceptions require formation of specialized representations to distinguish exceptions from rule-following items in memory. By incorporating quantitative trial-by-trial predictions from SUSTAIN directly into fMRI analyses, we observed medial temporal lobe (MTL) activation consistent with 2 predicted psychological processes that enable exception learning: item recognition and error correction. SUSTAIN explains how these processes vary in the MTL across learning trials as category knowledge is acquired. Importantly, MTL engagement during exception learning was not captured by an alternate exemplar-based model of category learning or by standard contrasts comparing exception and rulefollowing items. The current findings thus provide a well-specified theory for the role of the MTL in category learning, where the MTL plays an important role in forming specialized category representations appropriate for the learning context. © The Author 2011.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,28,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

For children in each of six risk categories, physicians were asked to determine whether they would recommend for or against routine magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in a clinical practice guideline for children with recurrent headache.Results: Completed surveys were returned by 114 physicians. The proportion recommending routine neuroimaging for each risk group was 100% (50% risk), 99% (10% risk), 93% (4% risk), 54% (1% risk), 25% (0.4% risk), 4% (0.01% risk). Community pediatricians, physicians in practice >15 years, and physicians who believed they ordered neuroimaging less often than peers were less likely to recommend neuroimaging for the 1% risk group (all p < 0.05).Conclusions: There is no consensus among pediatric specialists regarding the appropriate decision threshold for neuroimaging in a clinical practice guideline for children with recurrent headache. Because of the impact that individual threshold preferences may have on guidelines, these findings support the need for careful composition of guideline committees and consideration of the role of patient and family preferences.

But this is not the whole story. Schizophrenia etiology can be divided roughly into biological predisposing factors and psychosocial precipitating factors. In the category of biological factors one can find: genes, obstetric complications, lonely childhood, neurodevelopmental disturbances, and gender (severe schizophrenia is more common in males and age-of-onset is approximately 5 yrs earlier in males). Psychosocial factors appear to be: living in the city, abusing drugs, being an immigrant, and suffering an excess of traumatic life events. The author discusses various models of schizophrenia and explanations of its symptoms, ending with a description of a dimensional model by J. Van Os et al (1998), in which neurodevelopmental impairment is most prominent at the severe chronic schizophrenic pole and an affective-reactive factor at the other, manic-depressive pole.

Methods: Paediatric cranial CT-data were retrospectively collected during a 1-year period, in 3 different hospitals of the same country. A dose tracking system was used to automatically gather information. Dose (CTDI and DLP), scan length, amount of retakes and demographic data were stratified by age and clinical indication; appropriate use of child-specific protocols was assessed. Results: In total, 296 paediatric cranial CT-procedures were collected. Although the median dose of each hospital was below national and international diagnostic reference level (DRL) for all age categories, statistically significant (p-value < 0.001) dose differences among hospitals were observed. The hospital with lowest dose levels showed smallest dose variability and used age-stratified protocols for standardizing paediatric head exams. Erroneous selection of adult protocols for children still occurred, mostly in the oldest age-group. Conclusion: Even though all hospitals complied with national and international DRLs, dose tracking and benchmarking showed that further dose optimization and standardization is possible by using age-stratified protocols for paediatric cranial CT. Moreover, having a dose tracking system revealed that adult protocols are still applied for paediatric CT, a practice that must be avoided. Key Points: • Significant differences were observed in the delivered dose between age-groups and hospitals. • Using age-adapted scanning protocols gives a nearly linear dose increase. • Sharing dose-data can be a trigger for hospitals to reduce dose levels. © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,15,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We investigated in vivo the potential of 7T imaging in characterizing polymicrogyria to determine whether additional features could be identified. Materials and Methods: Ten adult patients with polymicrogyria previously diagnosed by using 3T MR imaging underwent additional imaging at 7T. We assessed polymicrogyria according to topographic pattern, extent, symmetry, and morphology. Additional imaging sequences at 7T included 3D T2∗ susceptibility-weighted angiography and 2D tissue border enhancement FSE inversion recovery. Minimum intensity projections were used to assess the potential of the susceptibility-weighted angiography sequence for depiction of cerebral veins. Results: At 7T, we observed perisylvian polymicrogyria that was bilateral in 6 patients, unilateral in 3, and diffuse in 1. Four of the 6 bilateral abnormalities had been considered unilateral at 3T. While 3T imaging revealed 2 morphologic categories (coarse, delicate), 7T susceptibility-weighted angiography images disclosed a uniform ribbonlike pattern. Susceptibility-weighted angiography revealed numerous dilated superficial veins in all polymicrogyric areas. Tissue border enhancement imaging depicted a hypointense line corresponding to the gray-white interface, providing a high definition of the borders and, thereby, improving detection of the polymicrogyric cortex. Conclusions: 7T imaging reveals more anatomic details of polymicrogyria compared with 3T conventional sequences, with potential implications for diagnosis, genetic studies, and surgical treatment of associated epilepsy.

Most language tasks shown to be efficient with healthy children require metalinguistic or reading abilities, therefore adding attentional, cognitive and academic constraints that may be problematic in this context. This study experimented a panel of four language tasks that did not require high attentional skills, reading, or metalinguistic abilities. Two reference tasks involving auditory stimulation (words generation from category, ""category""; auditory responsive naming, ""definition"") were compared with two new tasks involving visual stimulation. These later were designed to tap spontaneous phonological production, in which the names of pictures to be named involve a phonological difference (e.g. in French poule/. boule/. moule; ""phon-diff"") or change of segmentation (e.g. in French car/car-te/car-t-on; ""phon-seg""). Eighteen healthy children participated (mean age: 12.7±3. years). Data processing involved normalizing the data via a matched pairs pediatric template, and inter-task and region of interest analyses with laterality assessment. The reference tasks predominantly activated the left frontal and temporal core language regions, respectively. The new tasks activated these two regions simultaneously, more strongly for the phon-seg task. The union and intersection of all tasks provided more sensitive or specific maps. The study demonstrates that both reference and new tasks highlight core language regions in children, and that the latter are useful for the mapping of spontaneous phonological processing. The use of several different tasks may improve the sensitivity and specificity of fMRI. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,12.7,17,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

This functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared children with a specific subtype of specific language impairment affecting structural language (n=21), to a matched group of typically developing children using a panel of four language tasks neither requiring reading nor metalinguistic skills, including two auditory lexico-semantic tasks (category fluency and responsive naming) and two visual phonological tasks based on picture naming. Data processing involved normalizing the data with respect to a matched pairs paediatric template, groups and between-groups analysis, and laterality indices assessment within regions of interest using single and combined task analysis. Children with specific language impairment exhibited a significant lack of left lateralization in all core language regions (inferior frontal gyrus-opercularis, inferior frontal gyrus-triangularis, supramarginal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus), across single or combined task analysis, but no difference of lateralization for the rest of the brain. Between-group comparisons revealed a left hypoactivation of Wernicke's area at the posterior superior temporal/supramarginal junction during the responsive naming task, and a right hyperactivation encompassing the anterior insula with adjacent inferior frontal gyrus and the head of the caudate nucleus during the first phonological task.

The implications of this gaze behavior for perception and brain activity are largely unknown. Here, we characterize and quantify a retinotopic bias implied by typical gaze behavior toward faces, which leads to eyes and mouth appearing most often in the upper and lower visual field, respectively. We found that the adult human visual system is tuned to these contingencies. In two recognition experiments, recognition performance for isolated face parts was better when they were presented at typical, rather than reversed, visual field locations. The recognition cost of reversed locations was equal to ~60% of that for whole face inversion in the same sample. Similarly, an fMRI experiment showed that patterns of activity evoked by eye and mouth stimuli in the right inferior occipital gyrus could be separated with significantly higher accuracy when these features were presented at typical, rather than reversed, visual field locations. Our findings demonstrate that human face perception is determined not only by the local position of features within a face context, but by whether features appear at the typical retinotopic location given normal gaze behavior. Such location sensitivity may reflect fine-tuning of category-specific visual processing to retinal input statistics. Our findings further suggest that retinotopic heterogeneity might play a role for face inversion effects and for the understanding of conditions affecting gaze behavior toward faces, such as autism spectrum disorders and congenital prosopagnosia.

Method: in this study, a sample of 12 children diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive subtype and 11 typically developing children with ages ranging from 6 to 14 years were submitted to neuropsychological assessment and Magnetic Resonance Imaging, including morphological and morphometrical investigations (region of interest and voxel-based morphometry). For the ADHD-i group, the volumetric measures obtained using the region of interest (ROI) approach were also correlated with their neuropsychological performance. Results: the results did not reveal differences between the ADHD-i group and the control group with respect to the morphologic data, but the morphometric analysis indicated a reduction of the volume of the left medial frontal gyri, the left anterior cingulate, the left caudate, the left thalamus and the right postcentral gyrus grey matter in the ADHD-i group. The ADHD-i group performed worse on neuropsychological tasks related to selective and sustained attention, semantic and phonological verbal fluency, working memory and the time of execution on the selective attention tasks. Significant correlations were found between the volumetric measurements and the neuropsychological data. Conclusions: our results suggest that structural volume differences between the ADHD-i group and the control group can be identified using a more refined method of analysis, such as VBM, and that the ADHD-i group presents worse performance with respect to attention, working memory and phonological fluency compared to controls.

Dysfunction of this gene is associated with cardiac abnormalities, especially in the left ventricular outflow tract, but can also cause a congenital malformation of the cerebral cortex. We noticed that some patients diagnosed at the neurogenetics clinic had first presented to a cardiologist, suggesting that earlier recognition may be possible if the diagnosis is suspected. Methods and results: From the Erasmus MC cerebral malformations database 24 patients were identified with cerebral bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) without other cerebral cortical malformations. In six of these patients, a pathogenic mutation in FLNA was present. In five a cardiac defect was also found in the outflow tract. Four had presented to a cardiologist before the cerebral abnormalities were diagnosed. Conclusions: The cardiological phenotype typically consists of aortic or mitral regurgitation, coarctation of the aorta or other left-sided cardiac malformations. Most patients in this category will not have a FLNA mutation, but the presence of neurological complaints, hyperlaxity of the skin or joints and/or a family history with similar cardiac or neurological problems in a possibly X-linked pattern may alert the clinician to the possibility of a FLNA mutation. © 2010 The Author(s).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Analysis of 64 studies comparing individuals with ASD and typical development (TD) showed greater difficulties in ASD compared with TD individuals in STM (Hedges’ g = −0.53, 95% CI [−0.90, −0.16], p = .005, I² = 96%) compared with LTM (g = −0.30, 95% CI [−0.42, −0.17], p < .00001, I² = 24%), a small difficulty in verbal LTM (g = −0.21, p = .01), contrasting with a medium difficulty for visual LTM (g = −0.41, p = .0002) in ASD compared with TD individuals. We also found a general diminution in free recall compared with cued recall and recognition (LTM, free recall: g = −0.38, p < .00001, cued recall: g = −0.08, p = .58, recognition: g = −0.15, p = .16; STM, free recall: g = −0.59, p = .004, recognition: g = −0.33, p = .07). We discuss these results in terms of their relation to semantic memory. The limited diminution in verbal LTM and preserved overall recognition and cued recall (supported retrieval) may result from a greater overlap of these tasks with semantic long-term representations which are overall preserved in ASD. By contrast, difficulties in STM or free recall may result from less overlap with the semantic system or may involve additional cognitive operations and executive demands. These findings highlight the need to support STM functioning in ASD and acknowledge the potential benefit of using verbal materials at encoding and broader forms of memory support at retrieval to enhance performance.

Methods: All children (<18 years and residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota) with new-onset epilepsy diagnosed between 1980 and 2004 and a single focal lesion on neuroimaging were identified by review of the Rochester Epidemiologic Project database. Outcomes were divided into three categories: (1) seizure freedom for 1 or more years at last follow-up, (2) ongoing seizures but not medically intractable epilepsy, and (3) medically intractable epilepsy or undergoing epilepsy surgery. We also evaluated the proportion who achieved seizure control without surgical intervention and whether lesion type predicted intractability. Key Findings: Of the 359 children with newly diagnosed epilepsy, 37 (10%) had a focal or hemispheric lesion on neuroimaging. Median age of diagnosis was 89 months (25th percentile 26 months, 75th percentile 142 months) and at follow-up was 137 months (25th percentile 95 months, 75th percentile 211 months). Eighty-three percent of children with malformations of cortical development, 67% with mesial temporal sclerosis, 33% with encephalomalacia, and 50% with vascular malformations had intractable epilepsy at follow-up or underwent resective surgery for medically intractable epilepsy. Among the different etiologies, presence of encephalomalacia predicted the lowest likelihood of medical intractability or undergoing surgery (p < 0.01). At final follow-up, 24 (65%) of our entire cohort was seizure free. Following surgery, seizure freedom was achieved in 80% with mesial temporal sclerosis, 67% with encephalomalacia, 67% with vascular malformation, and 50% with malformations of cortical development. There was no statistically significant difference between the different etiologies on neuroimaging and seizure freedom after surgery. Twelve children (32%) achieved seizure freedom with medical management alone. Significance: Focal lesions on neuroimaging confer a high risk of medical intractability among children with new-onset epilepsy. However, 32% of this cohort achieved seizure remission with medical management alone, including 58% with encephalomalacia and 33% with mesial temporal sclerosis. © 2011 International League Against Epilepsy.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,17,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Methods: In this single-center prospective cohort, outcome of children with tuberculous meningitis treated with standard regimens was assessed at 6 months and 12 months after discharge using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale. Results: Of 130 children, 38 died in hospital and 34 were either severely disabled or comatose/vegetative at discharge. At 6 and 12 months, 87% of the survivors were either normal (n = 62) or mildly disabled (n = 17, on the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scale). On multivariate analysis, the factors associated with poor outcome at 12 months were stage III at admission (adjusted odds ratio 4.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.7-11.2, P =.002) and presence of infarcts on neuroimaging (adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.6, P =.037). Conclusions: Despite the high in-hospital mortality, in resource-constraint settings, the survivors showed remarkable improvement, with two-thirds returning to a normal functional status at 6 months' follow-up. © The Author(s) 2016.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,2,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We analyzed the relationship between lesion characteristics on brain MRI and motor function in children who had suffered from NAIS. Thirty eight full term born children with unilateral NAIS were investigated at the age of seven. 3D T1- and 3D FLAIR-weighted MR images were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Lesion characteristics were compared between patients with and without cerebral palsy (CP) using the following approaches: lesion localization either using a category-based analysis, lesion mapping as well as voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM). Using diffusion-weighted imaging the microstructure of the cortico-spinal tract (CST) was related to the status of CP by measuring DTI parameters. Whereas children with lesions sparing the primary motor system did not develop CP, CP was always present when extensive lesions damaged at least two brain structures involving the motor system. The VLSM approach provided a statistical map that confirmed the cortical lesions in the primary motor system and revealed that CP was highly correlated with lesions in close proximity to the CST. In children with CP, diffusion parameters indicated microstructural changes in the CST at the level of internal capsule and the centrum semiovale. White matter damage of the CST in centrum semiovale was a highly reproducible marker of CP. This is the first description of the implication of this latter region in motor impairment after NAIS. In conclusion, CP in childhood was closely linked to the location of the infarct in the motor system.

Optimal management of PA is grosstotal resection (GTR), after which event-free survival (EFS) is excellent. The tempo of recurrences, when they do occur, is relatively sparsely reported, and there is no agreed upon surveillance recommendation for patients in this category. It has been suggested that surveillance MRI is performed too frequently and could be safely reduced in both frequency and duration. The authors conducted a retrospective review of pediatric patients with PA who underwent GTR at a single institution over an 18-year period and who had documented recurrences. Methods All patients under 18 years of age who had undergone GTR of a PA between 1996 and 2013 were included in the study. Clinical, radiological, and tumor characteristics were recorded. Results Sixty-seven patients met the criteria for GTR over the period studied. The 5-year EFS rate was 95% (95% CI 89%-100%) and overall survival was 100%. Recurrences showed a nonsignificant trend of occurring more commonly in patients with persistent nonenhancing FLAIR abnormalities after surgery, but there was no difference with regard to tumor location. All recurrences occurred before 3 years postresection, all were asymptomatic, and all patients were observed for at least one additional scan after the initial detection during routine surveillance MRI before further therapy was undertaken. Conclusions EFS and overall survival are excellent after GTR in this population with PAs. Progression after recurrence occurs slowly and is asymptomatic. A less intensive schedule of MRI surveillance in this group of patients would result in time and cost savings, without compromising safety. The authors suggest a schedule of 6 MRI scans to be obtained postoperatively, at 3-6 months, then at 1, 2, 3.5, and 5 years. © AANS, 2016.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,18,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We explored the possible impacts of autism-related neural abnormalities on perceptual category learning using a neural network model of visual cortical processing. When applied to experiments in which children or adults were trained to classify complex two-dimensional images, the model can account for atypical patterns of perceptual generalization. This is only possible, however, when individual differences in learning are taken into account. In particular, analyses performed with a self-organizing map suggested that individuals with high-functioning ASD show two distinct generalization patterns: one that is comparable to typical patterns, and a second in which there is almost no generalization. The model leads to novel predictions about how individuals will generalize when trained with simplified input sets and can explain why some researchers have failed to detect learning or generalization deficits in prior studies of category learning by individuals with autism. On the basis of these simulations, we propose that deficits in basic neural plasticity mechanisms may be sufficient to account for the atypical patterns of perceptual category learning and generalization associated with autism, but they do not account for why only a subset of individuals with autism would show such deficits. If variations in performance across subgroups reflect heterogeneous neural abnormalities, then future behavioral and neuroimaging studies of individuals with ASD will need to account for such disparities. © 2013 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
"Drucker, Jonathan Harris",2016,databases,Neural bases of core and conceptual self: Implications for the representation of other persons and groups of people,NaN,NaN,"Self-representation is multifaceted. Building on prior research, the current experiment explores two such facets, core and conceptual self, and how these constructs extend to neurocognitive representations of other persons and groups of people. Core self is a representation of oneself as an individual whose subjective experience is unified within a particular moment. It includes identification with one's body (body ownership), authorship for one's actions (agency), and an embodied, egocentric point of view (first-person perspective). Conceptual self is a representation of oneself as an individual whose identity persists through time. It includes one's personality traits and physical characteristics, and the narrative of one's life constructed from accumulated autobiographical memories. I conducted an fMRI experiment (N = 19) to determine the neural correlates of core and conceptual representations for the self, other persons, and groups of people. On each trial, participants were presented for three seconds with an individual (the self, a relative, a friend, or an acquaintance), a group (adults or children), or a semantic prompt (physical or genetic). Participants were then presented for three seconds with a property (e.g., tall) and rated how well the property applied to the individual (e.g., how tall is the individual?), group (e.g., how tall are children?), or prompt (e.g., to what extent is tall a genetic property?). The first phase, in which the individual, group, or prompt was presented, was intended to elicit core representations. The second phase, in which the property was presented, was intended to elicit conceptual representations. The core self condition recruited brain areas associated with body ownership, agency, the first-person perspective, and visuospatial imagery. The conceptual self condition involved these as well, and further implicated brain areas associated with representing personality traits, semantic person knowledge, and executive control of memory retrieval, decision making, and theory-of-mind. Representations for other persons and groups of people rely on these and other systems insofar as the information they provide is relevant to the task at hand, and available with respect to that person or group of people. Some differences between self and other were modulated by the closeness of the personal relationship.

Application to PET images of children with autistic spectrum disorders,NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.05.011,"Learning with discriminative methods is generally based on minimizing the misclassification of training samples, which may be unsuitable for imbalanced datasets where the recognition might be biased in favor of the most numerous class. This problem can be addressed with a generative approach, which typically requires more parameters to be determined leading to reduced performances in high dimension. In such situations, dimension reduction becomes a crucial issue. We propose a feature selection/classification algorithm based on generative methods in order to predict the clinical status of a highly imbalanced dataset made of PET scans of forty-five low-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and thirteen non-ASD low functioning children. ASDs are typically characterized by impaired social interaction, narrow interests, and repetitive behaviors, with a high variability in expression and severity. The numerous findings revealed by brain imaging studies suggest that ASD is associated with a complex and distributed pattern of abnormalities that makes the identification of a shared and common neuroimaging profile a difficult task. In this context, our goal is to identify the rest functional brain imaging abnormalities pattern associated with ASD and to validate its efficiency in individual classification. The proposed feature selection algorithm detected a characteristic pattern in the ASD group that included a hypoperfusion in the right Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) and a hyperperfusion in the contralateral postcentral area. Our algorithm allowed for a significantly accurate (88%), sensitive (91%) and specific (77%) prediction of clinical category. For this imbalanced dataset, with only 13 control scans, the proposed generative algorithm outperformed other state-of-the-art discriminant methods. The high predictive power of the characteristic pattern, which has been automatically identified on whole brains without any priors, confirms previous findings concerning the role of STS in ASD.

The Epilepsy Surgery Grading Scale (ESGS) is a three-tier empirically derived mathematical scale with five categories: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), concordance (between MRI and EEG), semiology, and IQ designed to stratify patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy based on their likelihood of proceeding to resective epilepsy surgery and achieving seizure freedom. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we abstracted data from the charts of all patients admitted to the New York University Langone Medical Center (NYULMC) for presurgical evaluation or presented in surgical multidisciplinary conference (MDC) at the NYU Comprehensive Epilepsy Center (CEC) from 1/1/2007 to 7/31/2008 with focal epilepsy, who met minimal criteria for treatment resistance. We classified patients into ESGS Grade 1 (most favorable), Grade 2 (intermediate), and Grade 3 (least favorable candidates). Three cohorts were evaluated: all patients, patients presented in MDC, and patients who had resective surgery. The primary outcome measure was proceeding to surgery and seizure freedom. Results: Four hundred seven patients met eligibility criteria; 200 (49.1%) were presented in MDC and 113 (27.8%) underwent surgery. A significant difference was observed between Grades 1 and 3, Grades 1 and 2, and Grades 2 and 3 for all presurgical patients, and those presented in MDC, with Grade 1 patients having the highest likelihood of both having surgery and becoming seizure-free. There was no difference between Grades 1 and 2 among patients who had resective surgery. Significance: These results demonstrate that by systematically using basic information available during initial assessment, patients with drug-resistant epilepsy may be successfully stratified into clinically meaningful groups with varied prognosis. The ESGS may improve communication, facilitate decision making and early referral to a CEC, and allow patients and physicians to better manage expectations.

In parallel emerged the ability to detach oneself from the immediate environment to process abstract thoughts and solve problems and to understand other individuals' thoughts and intentions. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) is thought to play an important role in supporting the integration of abstract, often self-generated, thoughts. Thoughts can be temporally abstract and relate to long term goals, or past or future events, or relationally abstract and focus on the relationships between representations rather than simple stimulus features. Behavioural studies have provided evidence of a prolonged development of the cognitive functions associated with RLPFC, in particular logical and relational reasoning, but also episodic memory retrieval and prospective memory. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies provide further support for a prolonged development of RLPFC during adolescence, with some evidence of increased specialisation of RLPFC activation for relational integration and aspects of episodic memory retrieval. Topics for future research will be discussed, such as the role of medial RPFC in processing abstract thoughts in the social domain, the possibility of training abstract thinking in the domain of reasoning, and links to education. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
"Duong, Priscilla",2020,databases,Higher-level reading processes in children with dyslexia: A functional imaging study of sentence comprehension,NaN,NaN,"This dissertation examined higher-level reading processes in children with dyslexia, given the importance of these processes in extracting meaning when reading. Few studies have examined the neural underpinnings of higher-level reading skills necessary for reading comprehension, such as semantic processing. Expanding our knowledge about the reading processes involved with reading comprehension is important for guiding intervention. This study included children with (n = 20) and without (n = 18) dyslexia (10 - 16 years old) from an archival dataset collected from the Bay Area. Participants completed a behavioral reading assessment battery as well as a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sentence comprehension task. As expected, results of behavioral analyses revealed that children with dyslexia relied more on word identification, possibly through lexical access, to comprehend text, whereas typically developing children primarily accomplished reading comprehension through phonological decoding. Contrary to expectations, fMRI results revealed that children with dyslexia had overactivation in the grapheme-to-phonological network, namely the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and no areas of underactivation in the orthographic-to-semantic network. Furthermore, two sets of regression analyses were conducted with all participants together. Worse behavioral reading comprehension performance was associated with increased activation of the left SMG. The variable word reading residual (WRR) was created to isolate semantic processing at the word level, and scores were associated with right hemispheric frontal and parietal activation, which are implicated as compensatory brain regions in children with dyslexia. In conclusion, the present study furthers our knowledge of the processes involved in reading comprehension during childhood in both typically developing readers and those with dyslexia. Consistent with the definition of dyslexia suggesting deficient phonological decoding skills, neuroimaging findings suggest that there is abnormality in the grapheme-to-phonological network during reading comprehension. Findings also possibly suggest that the orthographic-to-semantic network is comparable in children with dyslexia and typically developing children during reading comprehension. However, these results must be interpreted with caution given that this is inferred from nonsignificant differences and lenient statistical thresholds. It is possible that with a larger sample size and more homogenous groups, there would be significant differences that would have validated the hypotheses.

The present study investigated neurocognitive processes of learning to read after one year of schooling. We aimed to elucidate the cognitive processes underlying neural tuning for print that has been shown to play an important role for reading and dyslexia. A 128-channel EEG was recorded while 68 (Swiss-)German monolingual first grade children (mean age: 7.6) performed a one-back task with different types of letter and false-font strings. Print tuning was indexed by the N1 difference in the ERPs between German words and false-font strings, while the N1 lexicality effect was indexed by the difference between German words and pseudowords. In addition, we measured reading fluency, rapid automatized naming, phonological awareness, auditory memory span, and vocabulary. After one year of formal reading instruction N1 print tuning was clearly present at the group level, and could be detected at the individual level in almost 90% of the children. The N1 lexicality effect, however, could not be reliably found. On the cognitive level, next to word-reading fluency, vocabulary was also associated with N1 print tuning, but not measures reflecting phonological processing. These results demonstrate the presence of print tuning in the first year of reading acquisition and its development at the individual level. Moreover, individual differences in print tuning are not only related to word-reading fluency, but also to semantic knowledge, indicating that at early stages of learning to read the top-down modulation of print tuning is semantic rather than phonological in nature. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,8,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

CNS GCTs are most commonly located in the pineal and suprasellar regions of the brain and can be divided into major groups including germinomas and nongerminomatous GCTs (NGGCTs), with teratomas often considered a separate category. The clinical presentation varies by location and size, and it frequently includes endocrine abnormalities, visual changes, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Neuroimaging studies cannot differentiate GCTs from other tumors, and therefore, the diagnosis usually requires histologic confirmation. The rare exceptions are the cases where characteristic elevations of tumor markers, including alpha-fetoprotein and/or β-human chorionic gonadotropin are documented in the serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. In these cases, the imaging findings along with the tumor marker elevation may be diagnostic in themselves without the need for tissue confirmation. Treatment and prognosis differ greatly between groups. Germinomas have a superior prognosis than NGGCTs. Five-year overall survival rates >90% were reported initially with the use of craniospinal irradiation. More recently, the use of chemotherapy in addition to radiation therapy has afforded the ability to decrease the dose and volume of radiation therapy without affecting survival rates. NGGCTs are less radiosensitive than germinomas, but the use of adjuvant chemotherapy has improved survival rates in this group as well. The standard management for CNS GCTs remains controversial.

Recent studies suggest that perturbations of the glutamate metabolizing enzymes glutamine synthetase (GS) and phosphate activated glutaminase (PAG) may underlie the glutamate excess in TLE. However, the molecular mechanism of the enzyme perturbations remains unclear. A better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of GS and PAG could facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutics for TLE. Methods: We used in situ hybridization on histologic sections to assess the distribution and quantity of messenger RNA (mRNA) for GS and PAG in subfields of hippocampal formations from the following: (1) patients with TLE and concomitant hippocampal sclerosis, (2) patients with TLE and no hippocampal sclerosis, and (3) nonepilepsy autopsy subjects. Key Findings: GS mRNA was increased by ∼50% in the CA3 in TLE patients without hippocampal sclerosis versus in TLE patients with sclerosis and in nonepilepsy subjects. PAG mRNA was increased by >100% in the subiculum in both TLE patient categories versus in nonepilepsy subjects. PAG mRNA was also increased in the CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate hilus in TLE without hippocampal sclerosis versus in TLE with sclerosis. Finally, PAG mRNA was increased in the dentate gyrus in TLE with sclerosis versus in nonepilepsy subjects, and also increased in the hilus in TLE without sclerosis versus in TLE with sclerosis. Significance: These findings demonstrate complex changes in the expression of mRNAs for GS and PAG in the hippocampal formation in TLE, and raise the possibility that both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms may underlie the regulation of GS and PAG proteins in the epileptic brain. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2012 International League Against Epilepsy.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,42,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In keeping with the increasing recognition of the dimensional characteristics of ASD symptoms and the categorical nature of a diagnosis, we sought to delineate the neural mechanisms of ASD symptoms based on the functional connectivity of four known neural networks (i.e., default mode network, dorsal attention network, salience network, and executive control network). Methods We leveraged an open data resource (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) providing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets from 90 boys with ASD and 95 typically developing boys. This data set also included the Social Responsiveness Scale as a dimensional measure of ASD traits. Seed-based functional connectivity was paired with linear regression to identify functional connectivity abnormalities associated with categorical effects of ASD diagnosis, dimensional effects of ASD-like behaviors, and their interaction. Results Our results revealed the existence of dimensional mechanisms of ASD uniquely affecting each network based on the presence of connectivity-behavioral relationships; these were independent of diagnostic category. However, we also found evidence of categorical differences (i.e., diagnostic group differences) in connectivity strength for each network as well as categorical differences in connectivity-behavioral relationships (i.e., diagnosis-by-behavior interactions), supporting the coexistence of categorical mechanisms of ASD. Conclusions Our findings support a hybrid model for ASD characterization that includes a combination of categorical and dimensional brain mechanisms and provide a novel understanding of the neural underpinnings of ASD. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,13,18,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Prominent among these responses are a surface-negative potential at ∼200-ms postonset (face-N200) and face-induced spectral perturbations in the gamma band (face-γERSP). The degree to which these responses represent activity in the same cortical loci and the degree to which they are influenced by the same perceptual and task variables are unknown. We evaluated this anatomical colocalization and functional correlation in 2 experiments in which the electrocorticogram was recorded from subdural electrodes in 51 participants. Experiment 1 investigated the category specificity of the γERSP and its colocalization with the face-N200. Experiment 2 examined differences in face-N200 and face-γERSP to face stimuli that varied in featural complexity. We found that γERSP is a category-specific phenomenon with separate, though overlapping, category sensitivities as the N200. Further, the presence of face-γERSP at an electrode site significantly predicted the presence and amplitude of face-N200 at that site. However, the converse was not true in that face-N200 was evoked by impoverished face stimuli that did not induce face-γERSP. These results demonstrate that these electrophysiological responses reflect separate components of the brain's face processing system. © The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press.

To review the evaluation of neuropsychological functions by using non-invasive functional neuroimaging methods. Development. Non-invasive functional neuroimaging methods can be sorted into two broad categories: the first includes those that make use of electromagnetic techniques, such as event-related potentials and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and the second consists of those involving haemodynamic techniques, such as positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. These methods have been employed in particular to evaluate the following functions: attention, perception, imagination, language, working memory, semantic retrieval, episodic memory, episodic memory retrieval, priming and procedural memory. The capacity of MEG, both for analysis and for organising the information it receives, is so large that it takes only a few milliseconds to evaluate brain activity and to create functional maps of the brain in which the brain structure is set out in blocks of cubic centimetres or even millimetres. This makes it possible to generate functional maps of brain activity that are capable of being organised and represented in terms of both time and space. It also enables us to obtain images that result from the signalling activity of sets of nerve cells (especially from the dendritic currents) and the electromagnetic signal that carries this information to the outer surface of the head, where the magnetic flow can be recorded. Conclusions. With the findings from these studies it has become possible to establish a topographic correlation between the functions and the basic brain processes involved in each paradigm. A growing body of clinical evidence proves the value of using them (especially MEG) with cases of epilepsy, language, dyslexia, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. © 2006, Revista de Neurología.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Using the GOSE-P, 62% had deficits at 2 weeks, and 42% improved from 2 weeks to 3 months. Agreement between the GOSE-P and HBI was fair 2 weeks after TBI (k = 0.24-0.33), and poor for identifying subsequent improvement (k = 0.10-0.16).

Language functions recover particularly well, while visuo-spatial skills are more affected by brain damage, regardless of its localization. This study investigated the lateralization of language and visual search after childhood stroke. Methods: Ten patients with unilateral stroke (aged 10-19 years, five left-, five right-sided lesion) and 20 healthy controls (aged 8-20 years) completed a neuropsychological test battery and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) intended to activate predominantly right (visual search) and left-sided functional networks (language). Results: After stroke, patients demonstrated atypical lateralization of visual search functions (8/10 patients, left lateralization) more often than that of language (4/10 patients, right lateralization). There was a dissociation between the lateralization of productive and semantic language (4/10 patients, 1/20 controls) and between the lateralization of simple and complex visual search (3/10 patients, 3/20 controls). In patients, atypical contralateral activations occurred in the same areas that showed decreasing activation during development in healthy participants. Conclusion: The lateralization of functions depends upon the cognitive function measured.

It was hypothesized that the group with TBI would evidence poorer performance on cognitive measures and a decrease in structural integrity. Research design: Between a paediatric group with TBI and a group of typically-developing children, the long-term effects of traumatic brain injury were investigated in relation to both structural integrity and cognition. Common metrics for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used as indicators of white matter integrity. Methods and procedures: Using DTI, this study examined ventral striatum (VS) integrity in 21 patients aged 10–18 years sustaining moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) 5–15 years earlier and 16 demographically comparable subjects. All participants completed Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System (D-KEFS) sub-tests. Main outcomes and results: The group with TBI exhibited lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and executive functioning performance and higher apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).

Although this observed phenomenon is accepted, its neurobiological mechanisms are not well characterized. In this paper we examined the functional neuroanatomy of lexical processing in 13 children/adolescents with perinatal left hemispheric damage. In contrast to many previous perinatal infarct fMRI studies, we used an event-related design, which allowed us to isolate trial-related activity and examine correct and error trials separately. Using both group and single subject analysis techniques we attempt to address several methodological factors that may contribute to some discrepancies in the perinatal lesion literature. These methodological factors include making direct statistical comparisons, using common stereotactic space, using both single subject and group analyses, and accounting for performance differences. Our group analysis, investigating correct trial-related activity (separately from error trials), showed very few statistical differences in the non-involved right hemisphere between patients and performance matched controls. The single subject analysis revealed atypical regional activation patterns in several patients; however, the location of these regions identified in individual patients often varied across subjects. These results are consistent with the idea that alternative functional organization of trial-related activity after left hemisphere lesions is in large part unique to the individual. In addition, reported differences between results obtained with event-related designs and blocked designs may suggest diverging organizing principles for sustained and trial-related activity after early childhood brain injuries. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,32,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Critics describe ADHD as a diagnosis used to label difficult children who are not ill but whose behavior is at the extreme end of normal. They further contend that, far from having a biological basis, ADHD results from poor parenting and ineffective teaching practices. Such attitudes do much to further stigmatize patients and their families and increase the burden of this debilitating condition.

We found that Chinese participants categorized the race of Caucasian faces more accurately and faster than that of Chinese faces, replicating the robust effect of the other-race categorization advantage. Regions of interest (ROI) analyses revealed greater neural activations when participants were categorizing own-race faces than other-race faces in the bilateral ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOT) such as the fusiform face areas (FFAs) and the occipital face areas (OFAs). Within the left FFA, there was also a significant negative correlation between the behavioral difference of own- and other-race face categorization accuracy and the activation difference between categorizing own- and other-race faces. Whole brain analyses showed that categorizing own-race faces induced greater activations in the right medial frontal cortex (MFC) and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) than categorizing other-race faces. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses revealed that the frontal cortical regions interacted more strongly with the posterior VOT during the categorization of own-race faces than that of other-race faces. Overall, our findings suggest that relative to the categorization of other-race faces, more cortical resources are engaged during the categorization of own-race faces with which we have a higher level of processing expertise. This increased involvement of cortical neural sources perhaps serves to provide more in-depth processing of own-race faces (such as individuation), which in turn paradoxically results in the behavioral other-race categorization advantage.

The white  matter subgroup indicates a comprehensive list of vascular dementia causes,  mitochondrial diseases, and leukodystrophies. Whereas, the basal ganglia alterations  are due to metal accumulation pathologies, such as iron, copper, or calcium.

Here, we recorded brain activity from high-functioning children with ASD as they completed a visual-target detection task. We then assessed the extent to which object-based selective attention automatically generalized from targets to non-target exemplars from the same well-known object class (e.g., dogs). Our results provide clear electrophysiological evidence that children with ASD (N = 17, aged 8-13 years) process the similarity between targets (e.g., a specific dog) and same-category non-targets (SCNT) (e.g., another dog) to a lesser extent than do their typically developing (TD) peers (N = 21). A closer examination of the data revealed striking hemispheric asymmetries that were specific to the ASD group. These findings align with mounting evidence in the autism literature of anatomic underconnectivity between the cerebral hemispheres. Years of research in individuals with TD have demonstrated that the left hemisphere (LH) is specialized toward processing local (or featural) stimulus properties and the right hemisphere (RH) toward processing global (or configural) stimulus properties. We therefore propose a model where a lack of communication between the hemispheres in ASD, combined with typical hemispheric specialization, is a root cause for impaired categorization and the oft-observed bias to process local over global stimulus properties. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,10.5,13,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Background: SLE can produce cognitive impairment even without overt neuropsychiatric features, but the pathogenesis of this dysfunction is not well understood. Our preliminary study of non-NPSLE found evidence correlating cognitive impairment with increased choline/creatine (Ch/Cr) in frontal lobe WM. Methods: Subjects included 60 non-NPSLE patients and 24 controls. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed, and a battery of neuropsychologic tests was administered. Structural and metabolic measures were analyzed and correlated with neuropsychologic data. Results: No significant differences were found in total brain, gray matter, and WM volumes, or in frontal WM N-acetyl-aspartate/Cr, but the non-NPSLE group had significantly increased Ch/Cr in frontal WM. A WM cognitive score (WMCS) that included the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task, Letter Fluency, and Animal Naming was found to correlate with total WM volume, and lower WMCS correlated with higher left frontal WM Ch/Cr. Conclusions: Non-NPSLE patients had frontal WM metabolic changes that correlated with cognitive impairment, whereas no cerebral atrophy or WM axonal damage was evident. These data confirm and extend our previous observations supporting the role of microstructural WM changes in the cognitive impairment of non-NPSLE patients. The data also suggest that the WMCS may be sensitive to cognitive dysfunction from myelin damage that develops before axonal injury.

Patients were subdivided into four age categories: <2 years, between 2 to 4 years, between 4 to 8 years, and ≥8 years. The peak latency of P37 for PTN-SEPs, the peak latencies of N11, N13, P14, and N20, and the N13–N20 interpeak latency (IPL) for MN-SEPs were collected; the diagnostic accuracy measures of these parameters (analysis of receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curves) with respect to the presence of foramen magnum or lumbar spinal stenosis were analysed in each age category. Results: The ROC curve analysis showed that the most sensitive parameter in detecting the presence of foramen magnum stenosis was P37 latency in the first two age categories (<2y and ≥2–4y; sensitivity 0.63, specificity 1.00, and sensitivity 1.00, specificity 0.75 respectively).

We examined whether deficits in VPFC-related inhibitory processes, but not dorsal prefrontal (DPFC) based executive functions, represent an endophenotypic marker for bipolar disorder I (BDI). Methods: We used the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), commonly associated with DPFC function, and the Hayling Sentence Completion Task (HSCT) which engages the VPFC. Performance on these tests of 43 healthy participants was compared to that of 10 remitted BDI patients and 15 of their unaffected offspring. Results: Compared to healthy participants, patients and their offspring made more errors in the HSCT but offspring achieved more categories and made fewer perseverative errors in the WCST. Conclusions: Impaired response inhibition, predominantly a VPFC related function, may reflect familial predisposition to BDI while deficits in rule attainment, a DPFC based function, may be associated only with the clinical phenotype. © 2005 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,27.2,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Aims: A systematic literature review was performed with the aim to investigate the relationship between structural brain lesions identified by sMRI and motor outcomes in children with CP. Methods: Fifty-eight studies were included. The results were analysed in terms of population characteristics, sMRI (classified according to Krägeloh-Mann & Horber, 2007), gross and fine motor function and their interrelation. Outcomes: White matter lesions were the most common brain lesion types and were present in 57.8 % of all children with uCP, in 67.0 % of all children with bCP and in 33 % of the group of mixed subtypes. Grey matter lesions were most frequently registered in children with dyskinesia (n = 42.2 %). No structural anomalies visualized by sMRI were reported in 5.7 % of all cases. In all lesion types, an equal distribution over the different gross motor function classification system categories was present. The included studies did not report sufficient information about fine motor function to relate these results to structural imaging. Conclusions and implications: The relationship between brain structure and motor outcome needs to be further elucidated in a representative cohort of children with CP, using a more standardized MRI classification system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Findings on cine MRI studies have also increased our understanding of the mechanisms and anatomic causes of OSA in children. Objective: To compare lingual tonsil size between children with OSA and a group of normal controls. In addition, a subanalysis was made of the group of children with OSA comparing lingual tonsils between children with and without underlying Down syndrome. Materials and methods: Children with persistent OSA despite previous palatine tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy and controls without OSA underwent MR imaging with sagittal fast spin echo inversion-recovery images, and lingual tonsils were categorized as nonperceptible at imaging or present and measurable. When present, lingual tonsils were measured in the maximum anterior-posterior diameter. If lingual tonsils were greater than 10 mm in diameter and abutting both the posterior border of the tongue and the posterior pharyngeal wall, they were considered markedly enlarged. Results: There were statistically significant differences between the OSA and control groups for the presence vs. nonvisualization of lingual tonsils (OSA 33% vs. control 0%, P=0.0001) and mean diameter of the lingual tonsils (OSA 9.50 mm vs. control 0.0 mm, P=0.00001). Within the OSA group, there were statistically significant differences between children with and without Down syndrome for the three lingual tonsil width categories (P=0.0070) and occurrence of markedly enlarged lingual tonsils (with Down syndrome 35% vs. without Down syndrome 3%, P=0.0035). Conclusions: Enlargement of the lingual tonsils is relatively common in children with persistent obstructive sleep apnea after palatine tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.

Subjects ranging in age from 6–39 were asked to decide whether two line drawings, presented sequentially, were the same or different on the basis of physical (physical identity), nominal (name identity), or categorical (category identity) criteria. The amplitude of a negativity at 400 ms (Neg400) increased as the number of dimensions on which the two line drawings differed increased. This effect held for all age groups, and was interpreted as reflecting the degree of semantic and/or physical relationship between the two pictures. However, one finding for Neg400 did suggest a qualitative difference in processing mode between the younger and older subjects. Both Neg400 and P3b latencies showed highly significant linear age trends, decreasing with increasing age. These age‐related changes were interpreted as demonstrating quantitative speed of processing differences among age groups. The latencies of both Neg400 and P3b increased as the matching criteria became more complex. Moreover, P3b latency increased as the number of dimensions on which the two pictures differed increased, and this did not interact with age. Although both Neg400 and P3b showed age‐related changes in scalp distribution, the fact that each was related to the experimental variables in similar fashion in all age groups suggested that they were homologous components across the age range studied. Taken as a whole, the data support continuity of information processing during these tasks across a wide age range. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

The present study investigated the sensitivity to phonotactic regularities and its impact on semantic processing in 1-yearolds. We applied the method of event-related brain potentials to 12- and 19-month-old children and to an adult control group. While looking at pictures of known objects, subjects listened to spoken nonsense words that were phonotactically legal (pseudowords) or had phonotactically illegal word onsets (nonwords), or to real words that were either congruous or incongruous to the picture contents. In 19-month-olds and in adults, incongruous words and pseudowords, but not nonwords, elicited an N400 known to reflect mechanisms of semantic integration. For congruous words, the N400 was attenuated by semantic priming. In contrast, 12-month-olds did not show an N400 difference, neither between pseudo- and nonwords nor between incongruous and congruous words. Both 1-year-old groups and adults additionally displayed a lexical priming effect for congruous words, that is, a negativity starting around 100 msec after words onset. One-year-olds, moreover, displayed a phonotactic familiarity effect, that is, a widely distributed negativity starting around 250 msec in 19-month-olds but occurring later in 12-month-olds. The results imply that both lexical priming and phonotactic familiarity already affect the processing of acoustic stimuli in children at 12 months of age. In 19-month-olds, adult-like mechanisms of semantic integration are present in response to phonotactically legal, but not to phonotactically illegal, nonsense words, indicating that children at this age treat pseudowords, but not nonwords, as potential word candidates. © 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

From the perspective of memory maturation, this shift in behavioral development might represent a shift from slow procedural to fast declarative memory formation. Alternatively, it might be caused by the maturation of specific brain structures within the declarative memory system that may support lexical mapping from the very first. Here, we used the neurophysiological method of ERPs to watch the brain activity of 6-month-old infants, when repeatedly presented with object-word pairs in a cross-modal learning paradigm. We report first evidence that infants as young as 6 months are able to associate objects and words after only very few exposures. A memory test 1 day later showed that infants did not fully forget this newly acquired knowledge, although the ERP effects indicated it to be less stable than immediately after encoding. The combined results suggest that already at 6 months the encoding process of word learning is based on fast declarative memory formation, but limitations in the consolidation of declarative memory diminish the long lasting effect in lexical-semantic memory at that age. © 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,0.5,0,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The construct of a clinical high-risk (HR) state for psychosis has evolved to capture the prepsychotic phase, describing people presenting with potentially prodromal symptoms. The importance of this HR state has been increasingly recognized to such an extent that a new syndrome is being considered as a diagnostic category in the DSM-5. Objective: To reframe the HR state in a comprehensive state-of-the-art review on the progress that has been made while also recognizing the challenges that remain. Data Sources: Available HR research of the past 20 years from PubMed, books, meetings, abstracts, and international conferences. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Critical review of HR studies addressing historical development, inclusion criteria, epidemiologic research, transition criteria, outcomes, clinical and functional characteristics, neurocognition, neuroimaging, predictors of psychosis development, treatment trials, socioeconomic aspects, nosography, and future challenges in the field. Data Synthesis: Relevant articles retrieved in the literature search were discussed by a large group of leading worldwide experts in the field. The core results are presented after consensus and are summarized in illustrative tables and figures. Conclusions: The relatively new field of HR research in psychosis is exciting. It has the potential to shed light on the development of major psychotic disorders and to alter their course. It also provides a rationale for service provision to those in need of help who could not previously access it and the possibility of changing trajectories for those with vulnerability to psychotic illnesses.

In young adults, the degree of activation of a single large-scale memory network corresponds to the level of contextual detail involved; thus, differentiating between autobiographical, episodic, and semantic retrieval. In contrast to young adults, children and adolescents retrieve fewer contextual details, suggesting that they might not yet engage the entire memory circuitry and that this brain recruitment might lack the characteristic contextual differentiation found in adults. Twenty-one children (10–12 years of age), 20 adolescents (14–16 years of age), and 22 young adults (20–35 years of age) were assessed on a previously validated LTM retrieval task, while their brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results demonstrate that children, adolescents, and adults recruit a left-lateralized subset of the large-scale memory network, comprising semantic and language processing regions, with neither developmental group showing evidence of contextual differentiation within this network. Additionally, children and adolescents recruited occipital and parietal regions during all memory recall conditions, in contrast to adults who engaged the entire large-scale memory network, as described previously. Finally, a significant covariance between age and brain activation indicates that the reliance on occipital and parietal regions during memory retrieval decreases with age. These results suggest that both children and adolescents rely on semantic processing to retrieve long-term memories, which, we argue, may restrict the integration of contextual detail required for complex episodic and autobiographical memory retrieval. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,exclude,10.9,12,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The probability of survival can be enhanced if the tumor is detected at its premature stage. The intention of feature selection approach is to select a small subset of features which minimizes redundancy and maximizes relevance to the target such as the class labels in classification. Thus, the machine learning model receives a brief organization with high predictive accuracy using the selected prominent features. Therefore, currently, feature selection plays a significant role in machine learning and knowledge discovery. A novel hybrid supervised feature selection algorithm, called TRSFFQR (Tolerance Rough Set Firefly based Quick Reduct), is developed and applied for MRI brain images. The hybrid intelligent system aims to exploit the benefits of the basic models and at the same time, moderate their limitations. Different categories of features are extracted from the segmented MRI images, i.e., shape, intensity and texture based features. The features extracted from brain tumor Images are real values. Hence Tolerance Rough set is applied in this work. In this study, a hybridization of two techniques, Tolerance Rough Set (TRS) and Firefly Algorithm (FA) are used to select the imperative features of brain tumor. Performance of TRSFFQR is compared with Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA), Supervised Tolerance Rough Set–PSO based Relative Reduct (STRSPSO-RR) and Supervised Tolerance Rough Set–PSO based Quick Reduct (STRSPSO-QR).The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed technique as well as improvements over the existing supervised feature selection algorithms. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Among other findings, the entire symptomatic group demonstrated language delays, but almost none showed evidence for regression. Our results indicate similarities between the idiopathic and cryptogenic subgroups in most of the examined variables, and mutual differences from the symptomatic subgroup. The similarities between the first two subgroups support prior evidence that most perinatal factors and minor physical anomalies do not contribute to the development of core symptoms of autism.

Patients with atypical language had lower verbal abilities (F = 6.96, p = 0.01) and a trend toward lower nonverbal abilities (F = 3.58, p = 0.06). There were no differences in rates of atypical language across time, age groups, or MRI scanner. Conclusion: Early seizure onset and atypical handedness, as well as the location and nature of pathologic substrate, are important factors in language reorganization.

Objective: To determine whether a panel of fMRI tasks targeting different aspects of language processing increases accuracy in determining hemisphere language dominance. Methods: Twenty-six patients age 12 to 56 years, predominantly with temporal lobe epilepsy, were studied using whole-brain 1.5 T fMRI (echo planar imaging, blood oxygenation level-dependent) with three task categories using a block design: verbal fluency, reading comprehension, and auditory comprehension. fMRI t maps were visually rated at three thresholds. All patients had assessment of language lateralization by IAT. Results: fMRI showed left dominance in 21 patients, right dominance in 2, and bilateral activation in 2; raters disagreed over a left vs right bilateral rating in 1 patient. There was full agreement between IAT and fMRI in 21 of 25 patients (IAT failed in 1). In three instances of partial disparity with IAT, the fMRI panel showed consistent findings across raters. Agreement between raters was excellent (partial disagreement in only one patient); the panel of tasks was superior to any single task for interrater agreement (Cramer V 0.93 [range 0.91 to 1.0] vs 0.72 [range 0.60 to 0.86]). Conclusions: A panel of fMRI language paradigms may be more accurate for evaluating partial epilepsy patients than a single task.

We evaluated the role of DWI and ADC for outcome prediction after pediatric TBI (n = 37 TBI; n = 10 controls). Fifteen regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn on ADC maps that were grouped for analysis into peripheral gray matter, peripheral white matter, deep gray and white matter, and posterior fossa. All ROIs excluded areas that appeared abnormal on T2-weighted images (T2WI). Acute injury severity was measured using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and 6-12-month outcomes were assessed using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale (PCPCS) score. Patients were categorized into five groups: (1) controls; (2) all TBI patients; (3) mild/moderate TBI with good outcomes; (4) severe TBI with good outcomes; and (5) severe TBI with poor outcomes. ADC values in the peripheral white matter were significantly reduced in children with severe TBI with poor outcomes (72.8 ± 14.4 × 10-3 mm2/sec) compared to those with severe TBI and good outcomes (82.5 ± 3.8 × 10-3 mm 2/sec; p &lt; 0.05). We also found that the average total brain ADC value alone had the greatest ability to predict outcome and could correctly predict outcome in 84% of cases. Assessment of DWI and ADC values in pediatric TBI is useful in evaluating injury, particularly in brain regions that appear normal on conventional imaging. Early identification of children at high risk for poor outcome may assist in aggressive clinical management of pediatric TBI patients. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,8.7,16,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

It is necessary to explore the potential for these structures as early disease markers in subjects at high risk (HR) of schizophrenia. Methods: We performed a review of 29 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies measuring hippocampal and amygdala volumes in subjects at HR for schizophrenia. We reclassified subjects in 3 new HR categories: presence of only risk symptoms (psychotic moderate symptoms), presence of only risk factors (genetic, developmental or environmental), and presence of combined risk symptoms/factors. Results: Hippocampal volume reductions were detected in subjects with first episode (FE) of psychosis, in all young adults and in adolescents at HR of schizophrenia. The loss of tissue was mainly located in the posterior part of hippocampus and the right side seems more vulnerable in young adults with only risk symptoms. Instead, the anterior sector seems more involved in HR subjects with genetic risks. Abnormal amygdala volumes were found in FE subjects, in children with combined risk symptoms/factors and in older subjects using different inclusion criteria, but not in young adults. Conclusion: Hippocampal and amygdala abnormalities may be present before schizophrenia onset. Further studies should be conducted to clarify whether these abnormalities are causally or effectually related to neurodevelopment.

In this study, leveraging a large sample (143 subjects) with longitudinal rsfMRI scans (333 datasets), we aimed to characterize the important developmental process of the brain’s functional network architecture during the first 2 years of life. Based on spatial independent component analysis and longitudinal linear mixed effect modeling, our results unveiled the detailed topology and growth trajectories of nine cortical functional networks. Within networks, our findings clearly separated the brains networks into two categories: primary networks were topologically adult-like in neonates while higher-order networks were topologically incomplete and isolated in neonates but demonstrated consistent synchronization during the first 2 years of life (connectivity increases 0.13–0.35). Between networks, our results demonstrated both network-level connectivity decreases (−0.02 to −0.64) and increases (0.05–0.18) but decreasing connections (n = 14) dominated increasing ones (n = 5). Finally, significant sex differences were observed with boys demonstrating faster network-level connectivity increases among the two frontoparietal networks (growth rate was 1.63e-4 per day for girls and 2.69e-4 per day for boys, p < 1e-4).

Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent surgery for medically refractory epilepsy at our center between 1999 and 2012. Four predictive outcome indicators were selected: preoperative seizure frequency, history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and epilepsy duration. A score of 0 or 1 was given if the indicator was associated with poor or good outcome, respectively. A seizure freedom score (SFS) was calculated by adding these four categories (total score ranged from 0 to 4). A modified SFS (m-SFS) was then calculated with two additional outcome indicators: invasive electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation (IEI) (performed or not performed) and lobe of resection (temporal vs. extratemporal), for a score ranging from 0 to 6. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to calculate the probability of seizure freedom in the overall group. Statistical significance was tested using the log-rank test and comparison of 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The study population included 466 patients with 244 (52%) male. Seizure freedom rates were directly correlated with the SFS score: at 10 years, 36.9% of patients with SFS of 0 were seizure-free, as opposed to 45% for SFS = 1, 60% for SFS = 2, 72% for SFS 3 or above (p = 0.002). When calculated including the IEI and the localization, the score's performance improved: 24% of patients with a m-SFS of 0 were seizure-free at 10 years, as opposed to 38-59% for m-SFS = 1-3, and 75-79% for m-SFS of 4-6 (p < 0.001). Significance An easily measurable seizure freedom score could be a reliable tool to synthesize multiple seizure outcome predictors into a single simple score to predict postoperative seizure freedom. This tool will help with patient and family counseling and estimation of surgical candidacy at both early (SFS) and advanced (m-SFS) stages of a surgical evaluation. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2014 International League Against Epilepsy.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In most cases, MG and IM onset occur simultaneously even if the overlapping clinical manifestations could lead to delay the diagnosis in the early stage of disease. In these cases, thymic pathology is present in more than 50% of cases. Pathological findings can be consistent of polymyositis (63%), dermatomyositis (25%) or granulomatosis (12%). Accurate clinical manifestations and severity of IM in MG, including muscle specific antibodies (MSA) and muscle MRI, have not been systematically investigated and focal or mild subclinical myositis have not been reported. We observed that focal myositis or asymptomatic CK elevation can also occur in MG. In this review we have also retrospectively re-analyzed the clinical, serological, pathological and muscle imaging data from 13 patients with MG- IM from our cohort of 441 MG patients (2,9%). Clinical onset occurred simultaneously in 10/13 patients, whereas in 2 patients the IM appeared later in MG disease course (range 10–14 years) and conversely in 1 patient MG symptoms occurred later in IM disease course (4 years). Median age at disease onset was 51 year (range 24–73 years) regardless of clinical onset (MG or IM). Median clinical follow-up was 88 months (range 31–237 months). IM was suspected by CK elevation in all patients (ranging 800–3000 UI/L at first detection) and non-fatigable muscle weakness unresponsive to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. All the patients presented mild to moderate MG symptoms. Three main categories of muscle involvement, sometimes overlapping, were recognizable: distal, proximal and subclinical myositits, leading to three main clinical groups (A,B,C) and two overlapping subgroups (A/B and B/C). Thymus pathology was present in 10/13 patients. Anti-AChR was detected in al all patients associated with anti-Titin and -RyR1 in those patients with thymoma. No MSA, nor MAA antibodies were detected. Muscle biopsy confirmed IM in all patients. In conclusion we redefined the clinical spectrum of muscle involvement in MG-IM association, which represent a continuum among 3 main clinical groups: distal, proximal and subclinical muscle involvement. Minimal muscle involvement and focal myositis could be underestimated among myasthenic patients and early aggressive immunotherapy could be required in focal group. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

However, research using human neuroimaging has revealed that much heterogeneity exists across individuals in both clinical and control samples. This reality necessitates that researchers identify and organize the potentially varied patterns of brain physiology. We introduce an analytical approach for arriving at subgroups of individuals based entirely on their brain physiology. The method begins with Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME) to assess individual directed functional connectivity maps. GIMME is one of the only methods to date that can recover both the direction and presence of directed functional connectivity maps in heterogeneous data, making it an ideal place to start since it addresses the problem of heterogeneity. Individuals are then grouped based on similarities in their connectivity patterns using a modularity approach for community detection. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that using GIMME in combination with the modularity algorithm works exceptionally well - on average over 97% of simulated individuals are placed in the accurate subgroup with no prior information on functional architecture or group identity. Having demonstrated reliability, we examine resting-state data of fronto-parietal regions drawn from a sample (N = 80) of typically developing and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) -diagnosed children. Here, we find 5 subgroups. Two subgroups were predominantly comprised of ADHD, suggesting that more than one biological marker exists that can be used to identify children with ADHD based from their brain physiology. Empirical evidence presented here supports notions that heterogeneity exists in brain physiology within ADHD and control samples. This type of information gained from the approach presented here can assist in better characterizing patients in terms of outcomes, optimal treatment strategies, potential gene-environment interactions, and the use of biological phenomenon to assist with mental health.

Recently, treatment of such children has been influenced by diagnostic technological advances. Multiple radiological abnormalities detected in temporal bone and brain are now increasingly included for CI. The primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of 'radiological abnormalities in temporal bone or brain' on CI outcome. Aim: The primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of 'radiological abnormalities in high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) temporal bone or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain' on CI outcome. Study Design: Prospective study. Setting: Tertiary care center. Materials and Methods: In this study, we evaluated fifty cochlear-implanted children from October 2011 to March 2013. The case group consisted of 15 (30%) children with radiological abnormalities and control group consisted of 35 (70%) children with no radiological abnormalities in HRCT temporal bone or MRI brain. All patients received auditory and speech rehabilitation, and their auditory perception outcomes 1 year after CI were evaluated. The children were assessed by categories of auditory perception (CAP) and Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS) tests. Results: There was significant reduction in mean auditory perception outcomes (decreased 6.9% mean CAP and 5.4% mean MAIS scores) at 1 year post-CI in CI recipients who had radiological abnormalities, in comparison to those who had no radiological abnormalities in temporal bone or brain (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In this study, presence of radiological abnormalities in temporal bone or brain was found to have a significant deleterious effect on auditory perception outcome at 1 year after CI surgery in children. However, CI was still helpful in these children. Hence, knowledge of 'radiological abnormalities in temporal bone or brain' can provide reasonable help in predicting the auditory perception outcome for CI candidates. © 2019 Indian Journal of Otology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,5.1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We characterized the proportion and distribution of language task activation in the cerebellum to determine the relationship to cerebral language lateralization. Methods Forty-six pediatric epilepsy surgery candidates (aged 7-19 years) completed an fMRI auditory semantic decision language task. Distribution of activated voxels and language laterality indices were computed using: (a) Broca's and Wernicke's areas and their right cerebral homologues; and (b) left and right cerebellar hemispheres. Language task activation was anatomically localized in the cerebellum. Results Lateralized language task activation in either cerebral hemisphere was highly correlated with lateralized language task activation in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere (Broca vs. cerebellar: ρ = -0.54, p < 0.01). Cerebellar language activation was located within Crus I/II, areas previously implicated in non-motor functional networks. Conclusions Cerebellar language activation occurs in homologous regions of Crus I/II contralateral to cerebral language activation in patients with both right and left cerebral language dominance. Cerebellar language laterality could contribute to comprehensive pre-operative evaluation of language lateralization in pediatric epilepsy surgery patients. Our data suggest that patients with atypical cerebellar language activation are at risk for having atypical cerebral language organization. © 2014 The Authors.

However, robust localization of crucial functional areas is required. OBJECTIVE: To establish a simple, short fMRI task that reliably localizes crucial language areas in individual patients who undergo respective surgery. METHODS: fMRI was measured during an 8-minute auditory semantic decision task in 28 healthy controls and 35 consecutive patients who had focal epilepsy or a brain tumor. Nineteen underwent resective surgery. Group and individual analyses were performed. Results in patients were compared with postsurgical language outcome and electrocortical stimulation when available. RESULTS: fMRI activations concordant with the anterior and posterior language areas were found in 96% and 89% of the controls, respectively. The anterior and posterior language areas were both activated in 93% of the patients. These results were concordant with electrocortical stimulation results in 5 patients. Transient postsurgical language deficits were found in 2 patients in whom surgery was performed in the vicinity of the fMRI activations or who had postsurgical complications implicating areas of fMRI activations. CONCLUSION: The proposed fast fMRI language protocol reliably localized the most relevant language areas in individual subjects. It appears to be a valuable complementary tool for surgical planning of epileptogenic foci and of brain tumors.

Headaches are divided into primary and secondary categories. Migraine and tension type headaches are prototype of primary headaches without underlying pathology. On the other hand, the type of headache which stems from organic diseases such as: brain tumor, increased intracranial pressure, systemic disease, drug toxicity or Ear Nose and Throat problems, are considered secondary. On the whole, the majority of children with primary headache have two patterns of headache. One is a chronic low-grade and the other is an intermittent disabling headache. The cause of the former is either caffeine or analgesic abuse, and the latter is predominantly migraine. Traditionally, if a child presents himself with chief complain of headache, care taker physician begins with history taking followed by thorough physical and neurological examinations.

HPC/SFT are subdivided into infantile (congenital) and adult type. Both are extremely rare entities, with little knowledge about etiology, prognosis, and optimal therapeutic strategy. Case Description: A 10-day-old girl was referred to our neurosurgical department due to hypotonia, palsy of the right oculomotor nerve, and prominent frontal fontanel. Imaging studies revealed a large occupying mass in the right middle cerebral fossa and the suprasellar cisterns. Only a subtotal resection of the tumor was possible, and postoperatively, she underwent chemotherapy (CHx). After a 3-year follow-up, the girl has minimum neurologic signs and receives no medications, and she can walk when she is supported. Conclusion: Congenital HPC/SFT is considered to have a benign behavior with a good prognosis. Treatment with gross total resection, when it is feasible, is the key to a good prognosis and low rates of recurrence. However, there is no consensus on the therapeutic strategy of a HPC/SFT, which is difficult to be completely resected.

Some believe that, over time, all memories become independent of their MTL component ('consolidation theories'). Others have suggested that this is true only of semantic memory, while episodic aspects of autobiographical memories are dependent on the MTL for as long as they exist, such as multiple trace theory (MTT). In the present study, the volumes of 28 brain regions, including the MTL, and their relation to autobiographical memory were investigated in a group of patients with Alzheimer's disease with varying degrees of retrograde memory loss as assessed by the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI). We used the multivariate analysis method of partial least squares (PLS) to assess patterns of atrophy that can lead to retrograde amnesia. We found that different aspects of autobiographical memory were associated with different patterns of tissue loss. Personal semantics were related to a pattern of bilateral anterior and posterior lateral temporal cortex degeneration, more pronounced on the left, as well as right frontal degeneration. Autobiographical event memory ('episodic') was associated with combined atrophy in bilateral MTL and anterior lateral temporal neocortex, more pronounced on the right. This pattern was invariant for memories from childhood, early adulthood, and recent memories, in line with the predictions of MTT, suggesting that MTL tissue is crucial for retrieval of episodic memories regardless of their age.

In the context of sequential cognitive flexibility, the 'backward inhibition (BI) effect' has been studied quite extensively. Here we ask whether there are age‐related differences between adolescents and adults to overcome BI and what system‐neurophysiological mechanisms underlie these modulations. This was examined using a system neurophysiological study procedure combining event‐related potentials data with source localization and EEG signal decomposition methods. We show that sequential cognitive flexibility, and the ability overcome backward inhibition, is inferior in adolescents compared with adults. Accounting for intra‐individual variability in the neurophysiological data, this data suggest that two partly inter‐related processes underlie the differences between adolescents than adults to overcome backward inhibition: One process refers to the suppression of the inhibitory effect of the n‐1 trial on the n‐2 trial during perceptual categorization of incoming information that is associated with right inferior frontal regions. The other process refers to immature response selection and conflict monitoring mechanisms associated with regions in the medial frontal cortex.

This single-site prospective observational cohort study included 85 CCM patients, in whom 24 a priori chosen plasma biomarkers were quantified and analyzed in relation to established clinical and imaging parameters of disease categorization and severity. We subsequently validated the positive correlations in longitudinal follow-up of 49 subjects. Plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 were significantly higher (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, respectively, FDR corrected), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 was lower (P = 0.04, FDR corrected) in patients with seizure activity at any time in the past. Vascular endothelial growth factor and endoglin (both P = 0.04, FDR corrected) plasma levels were lower in patients who had suffered a symptomatic bleed in the prior 3 months. The hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a cluster of four plasma inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 2, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin 1 beta) separating patients into what we designated “high” and “low” inflammatory states.

Long-term clinical and radiological follow-up is still incompletely elucidated. We report a 12-year-old male with intermittent-relapsing PDHC deficiency who presented with three typical acute episodes of metabolic decompensation over 7years. Neuroimaging showed reversible signal abnormalities in the basal ganglia, inferior olivary nuclei, periaqueductal grey matter, and dentate nuclei, with evidence of lactate on magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Molecular analysis of PDH1A revealed a novel hemizygous c.1045G>A mutation, predicting a p.A349T missense mutation.

We sought to determine whether there are any distinguishing characteristics of patients with encephalitis who develop refractory status epilepticus from those who do not. Methods: Data from all patients in the CEP were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Diagnostic testing was performed for a panel of infectious agents and medical information collected using a standardized form. Encephalitis patients were subdivided into three categories: (i) patients with status epilepticus unresponsive to standard antiepileptic therapy who required general anesthetic coma for management (Group I), (ii) patients with seizures or status epilepticus responsive to standard antiepileptic therapy (Group II), and (iii) patients without seizures (Group III). Supplementary information was requested on Group I patients. Results: Of 1,151 patients; 43 (4%) were classified as Group I, 459 (40%) as Group II, and 649 (56%) as Group III. Compared to Groups II and III, Group I patients were younger (median age = 10.0 years), more likely to have fever (93%), prodromal respiratory (57%) or gastrointestinal illness (64%), and less likely to have CSF pleocytosis (47%) or abnormal neuroimaging (16%). A causative infectious agent was verified in three of the Group I patients; and a putative agent in nine others. Supplementary information on Group I revealed that 28% died within 2 years and 56% were neurologically impaired or undergoing rehabilitation.

The estimated incidence of perinatal stroke is approximately 1/4000. Perinatal stroke can be classified by blood supply (venous vs. arterial), age at stroke (fetal vs. neonatal), age at diagnosis (neonatal symptomatic vs. presumed perinatal/neonatal asymptomatic), or type of stroke (ischemic vs. hemorrhagic). Investigators have used a variety of terms, including “perinatal stroke,” “arterial ischemic stroke,” and “perinatal arterial stroke” to describe the conditions. A recent workshop of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke focused on refining the terminology. Ischemic perinatal stroke (IPS), now the term of choice, is defined as “a group of heterogeneous conditions in which there is focal disruption of cerebral blood flow secondary to arterial or cerebral venous thrombosis or embolization, between 20 weeks of fetal life through the 28th postnatal day, confirmed by neuroimaging or neuropathologic studies.” The group further divided IPS into three categories based on the timing of diagnosis: (1) fetal ischemic stroke, diagnosed prior to birth using fetal imaging or following stillbirth on the basis of neuropathologic examination, (2) neonatal ischemic stroke, diagnosed after birth and ≤ 28th postnatal day (including preterm infants), and (3) presumed perinatal ischemic stroke (PPIS), diagnosed in children > 28 days of age in whom the ischemic event is presumed to have occurred between the 20th week of fetal life and the 28th postnatal day. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The syndrome occurs mainly in young, fertile, and overweight women but may present in any age group. The aim of this study was to report the presentation, course, and outcomes of older versus younger children presenting with IIH to the emergency department of our large tertiary care hospital during an 8-year period. Methods: Retrospective chart review (January 2000-December 2008) of all patients younger than 17 years with IIH was performed on the basis of modified Dandy Criteria. The patients were analyzed according to age (<11 years and 11-17 years) and weight centile (<90%, 90%-97%, >97%). Results: Ages ranged from 2 to 16.5 years (mean [SD], 9.71 [4.56] years). Thirty males (46.8%) and 33 females (53.2%) were identified: 30 were prepubertal with a male-female ratio of 1:0.56 and 33 were pubertal with a male-female ratio of 1:2 (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the 2 age groups in proportions of children in the 3 predefined weight categories The most common presenting symptom was headache (75%), which was significantly less common in the younger age group compared with the older group (P < 0.01). Papilledema was present in 51 patients (82.3%). Mean (SD) cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was 378 (16) mm H2O. Findings of brain imaging (mostly computed tomographic scan), performed in all patients, were normal in 42 (67.7%); the most common finding in the remainder was swelling of the optic nerves. Conclusions: Our results indicate that IIH should be considered in any child with new-onset headache or visual disturbance, irrespective of age, sex, weight, or the presence of known predisposing factors. When IIH is suspected, neuroimaging should be performed promptly to exclude secondary causes of this condition because IIH in children remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment for IIH can prevent potential visual loss. Copyright © 2015 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Right FFA and left PPA volumes were substantially larger in adults than in children. This development occurred by expansion of FFA and PPA into surrounding cortex and was correlated with improved recognition memory for faces and places, respectively.

In a recent behavioral study, using a new paradigm that isolated the semantic level of speech by using words, we showed that this native-language benefit is at least partly driven by semantic context (Golestani et al., 2009). Here, we used the same paradigm in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment to study the neural bases of speech intelligibility, as well as to study the neural bases of this semantic context effect in the native language. A forced-choice recognition task on the first of two auditorily presented semantically related or unrelated words was employed, where the first, 'target' word was embedded in different noise levels. Results showed that activation in components of the brain language network, including Broca's area and the left posterior superior temporal sulcus, as well as brain regions known to be functionally related to attention and task difficulty, was modulated by stimulus intelligibility. In line with several previous studies examining the role of linguistic context in the intelligibility of degraded speech at the sentence level, we found that activation in the angular gyrus of the left inferior parietal cortex was modulated by the presence of semantic context, and further, that this modulation depended on the intelligibility of the speech stimuli. Our findings help to further elucidate neural mechanisms underlying the interaction of context-driven and signal-driven factors during the perception of degraded speech, and this specifically at the semantic level. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

To answer this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan a unique group of adults who, as children, had extensive visual experience with Pokémon. These animal-like, pixelated characters are dissimilar from other ecological categories, such as faces and places, along critical dimensions (foveal bias, rectilinearity, size, animacy). We show not only that adults who have Pokémon experience demonstrate distinct distributed cortical responses to Pokémon, but also that the experienced retinal eccentricity during childhood can predict the locus of Pokémon responses in adulthood.

These may relate  to patterns of self-generated thought that can occur while not performing  goal-driven tasks. To understand the relationship between self-generated mental  activity and intrinsic neural fluctuations, we developed the New York Cognition  Questionnaire (NYC-Q) to assess the content and form of an individual's experiences  during the acquisition of resting-state fMRI data. The data were collected as a part  of the Nathan Kline Rockland Enhanced sample. We decomposed NYC-Q scores using  exploratory factor analysis and found that self-reported thoughts clustered into  distinct dimensions of content (future related, past related, positive, negative,  and social) and form (words, images, and specificity). We used these components to  perform an individual difference analysis exploring how differences in the types of  self-generated thoughts relate to whole brain measures of intrinsic brain activity  (fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and  degree centrality). We found patterns of self-generated thoughts related to changes  that were distributed across a wide range of cortical areas. For example,  individuals who reported greater imagery exhibited greater low frequency  fluctuations in a region of perigenual cingulate cortex, a region that is known to  participate in the so-called default-mode network. We also found certain forms of  thought were associated with other areas, such as primary visual cortex, the insula,  and the cerebellum. For example, individuals who reported greater future thought  exhibited less homogeneous neural fluctuations in a region of lateral occipital  cortex, a result that is consistent with the claim that particular types of  self-generated thought depend on processes that are decoupled from sensory  processes.

Here, I provide a selective overview of recent neuroimaging studies, drawing out implications for education and the teaching of reading. Purpose: The different neuroimaging technologies available offer complementary techniques for revealing the biological basis of reading and dyslexia. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is most suited to localisation of function, and hence to investigating the neural networks that underpin efficient (or inefficient) reading. Electroencephalography (EEG) is sensitive to millisecond differences in timing, hence it is suited to studying the time course of processing; for example, it can reveal when networks relevant to phonology versus semantics are activated. Magnetic source imaging (MSI) gives information about both location in the brain and the time course of activation. I illustrate how each technology is most suited to answering particular questions about the core neural systems for reading, and how these systems interact, and what might go wrong in the dyslexic brain. Design and methods: Following a brief overview of behavioural studies of reading acquisition in different languages, selected neuroimaging studies of typical development are discussed and analysed. Those studies including the widest age ranges of children have been selected. Neuroimaging studies of developmental dyslexia are then reviewed, focusing on (a) the neural networks recruited for reading, (b) the time course of neural activation and (c) the neural effects of remediation. Representative studies using the different methodologies are selected. It is shown that studies converge in showing that the dyslexic brain is characterised by under-activation of the key neural networks for reading. Conclusions: Different neuroimaging methods can contribute different kinds of data relevant to key questions in education.

There has been increasing awareness and recognition of pediatric cerebral arteriopathies as a predominant stroke etiology. Prompt diagnosis of arteriopathies is essential to limit injury and prevent recurrent stroke. Based on predominant vessels involved and clinical symptoms, these arteriopathies can be broadly divided into two categories: large-medium size arteriopathies and small vessel arteriopathies.

Seventy years ago increased medical radiation caused radiologists in the US an excess risk of leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Now medical radiation is rather safe for the physician but the question remains if proper prophylactic measures are being taken to make it safe for the subjects examined. Roughly, first trimester of pregnancy radiography has a much greater fatal cancer risk than that of exposures taken later in pregnancy. It is suggested that women should be administered the minimum activity consistent with achieving the desired clinical information, whether or not they are known to be pregnant. The best available risk estimates suggest that pediatric CT diagnostic procedures will induce significantly increased lifetime radiation risk in children. Professor Roger Clarke wrote that there may be a need to reduce or prevent doses of medical radiation up to 3 mSv if there is no benefit to the individual. 30 mSv is described as ""a dose which should not be exceeded"" and can be approached only if there is a benefit to individuals and the dose is difficult to reduce or prevent.

The current study explored the relationship between maternal reading ability and functional connectivity within the language network, between the language network and networks related to cognitive control and visual processing, as well as between the language network and the entire brain (network-to-voxel analysis) of preschool-age children during a resting state. Thirteen 4-year-old girls and their mothers participated in this study, involving cognitive testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging, including a resting-state scan. Maternal reading ability was negatively correlated with functional connectivity within the child's language network at rest, and also with areas involved in visual processing, cognitive-control, and semantics. These results suggest that children whose mothers exhibit decreased reading ability may demonstrate a greater engagement of the language network and neural circuits related to visual word recognition, cognitive-control, and semantic processing, which later in life support reading. © 2018",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Here, we aimed to test predictions of current theory and resolve  inconsistencies regarding right hemispheric contributions to long-term recovery. We  first defined the canonical semantic network in 43 healthy controls. Then, in a  group of 43 patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia, we tested whether activity in  this network predicted performance on measures of semantic comprehension, naming,  and fluency while controlling for lesion volume effects. Canonical network  activation accounted for 22%-33% of the variance in language test scores.  Whole-brain analyses corroborated these findings, and revealed a core set of regions  showing positive relationships to all language measures. We next evaluated the  relationship between activation magnitudes in left and right hemispheric portions of  the network, and characterized how right hemispheric activation related to the  extent of left hemispheric damage. Activation magnitudes in each hemispheric network  were strongly correlated, but four right frontal regions showed heightened activity  in patients with large lesions. Activity in two of these regions (inferior frontal  gyrus pars opercularis and supplementary motor area) was associated with better  language abilities in patients with larger lesions, but poorer language abilities in  patients with smaller lesions.

Because the left and right inferior frontal (LIF and RIF) regions are implicated with integration of speaker information, world knowledge, and semantic knowledge, we hypothesized that abnormal functioning of the LIF and RIF regions might contribute to pragmatic and semantic language deficits in autism. Brain activation of sixteen 12-to 18-year-old, high-functioning autistic participants was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging during sentence comprehension and compared with that of twenty-six matched controls. The content of the pragmatic sentence was congruent or incongruent with respect to the speaker characteristics (male/female, child/adult, and upper class/lower class). The semantic-and world-knowledge sentences were congruent or incongruent with respect to semantic expectancies and factual expectancies about the world, respectively. In the semantic-knowledge and world-knowledge condition, activation of the LIF region did not differ between groups. In sentences that required integration of speaker information, the autism group showed abnormally reduced activation of the LIF region. The results suggest that people with autism may recruit the LIF region in a different manner in tasks that demand integration of social information. The Author © 2009.

If surgery has failed reoperation after careful re-evaluation may be a reasonable option. This study was to summarise the risks and benefits of reoperation in patients with epilepsy. Methods This is a retrospective single centre study comprising clinical data, long-term seizure outcome, neuropsychological outcome and postoperative complications of patients, who had undergone a second resective epilepsy surgery from 1989 to 2009. Results: A total of 66 patients with median follow-up of 10.3 years were included into the study. Fifty-one patients (77%) had surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy, the remaining 15 cases for extra-temporal lobe epilepsies. The most frequent histological findings were tumours (n=33, 50%), followed by dysplasia, gliosis (n=11, each) and hippocampus sclerosis (n=9). The main reasons for seizure recurrence were incomplete resection (59.1%) of the putative epileptogenic lesion. After reoperation 46 patients (69.7%) were completely seizure-free International League Against Epilepsy 1 (ILAE 1) at the last available follow-up. The neuropsychological evaluation demonstrated that repeated losses in the same cognitive domain, that is, successive changes from better to worse performance categories, were rare and that those losses after first surgery were followed by improvement rather than decline. However, reoperations lead to an increased rate of permanent neurological deficits (9%), overall surgical complications (9%) and visual field deficits (67%). Conclusions: Reoperation after failed resective epilepsy surgery led to approximately 70% long-time seizure freedom and reasonable neuropsychological outcome.

However, there are categories of memory estimated independent of hippocampal function. In particular, factual knowledge is solely constituted from written or spoken input independent on undertaken experience, but the temporal structures involved are not well defined. Methods In this retrospective study, we mapped the activity of factual knowledge recall using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 60 patients scheduled for tumor or epilepsy surgery and in 18 patients resected within or close to the left mesial temporal lobe. Memory tests were performed preoperatively and postoperatively to investigate deficit symptoms in factual knowledge retrieval. Results We found a highly reproducible localized brain area within the parahippocampal gyrus, in the depth of the dorsal collateral sulcus, which was constantly involved in factual knowledge retrieval during fMRI tasks in 93% of patients (56/60) during recall of capital cities or multiplication tasks, in two thirds of the patients mainly on the dominant side. In addition, all 18 patients after surgery within this area showed postoperative factual knowledge deficits (56% permanent, 44% transitory), memory prognosis significantly correlating with the first day's factual knowledge retrieval task results. Conclusions Using fMRI, we visualized a circumscribed brain area within the parahippocampal gyrus during factual knowledge retrieval, the lesioning of which led to factual knowledge deficits. Thus, impairment of factual knowledge retrieval may occur if resection is extended into the parahippocampal gyrus. Preoperative fMRI memory maps may contribute to avoiding such deficits. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,27.4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

This study investigated a possible neuroanatomical substrate based on neuroimaging evaluation in children with DLD. The authors obtained psychological assessment, language evaluation, neurologic examination, and neuroimaging investigation for 15 children who met inclusion and exclusion criteria (at least 4 yrs old, a primary complaint of language delay, normal hearing, IQ >70, no severe motor or cognitive handicap). The Ss were 4-14 yrs old. Six patients presented diffuse polymicrogyria (PMG) around the entire extent of the sylvian fissure on MRI. They had severe clinical manifestation of DLD: they did not speak at all or had mixed phonologic-syntactic deficit syndrome. Six Ss presented PMG restricted to the posterior aspects of the parietal regions, and they had a milder form of DLD, mainly phonologic programing deficit syndrome. It is concluded that DLD can be associated with polymicrogyria and that clinical manifestation varies according to the extension of cortical abnormality.

Infants are in the high-risk category. Complete surgical resection is the single most important determinant of prognosis and survival in nonmetastatic disease. Infants with large primaries after incomplete resection/biopsy and poor general condition have bad prognosis. They are considered poor candidates for intensive chemotherapy involving high dose methotrexate/autologous stem cell transplantation as they are often unable to tolerate these aggressive regimens. Case Description The patient, withinfantile medulloblastoma, was supposed to have complete resection but only a biopsy could be attempted because of increased tumor vascularity. He was in very poor general condition after surgery and his parents declined aggressive chemotherapy and shunt surgery. He was given dose dense neo-adjuvant chemotherapy along with the histone deactylase inhibitor valproate for 5 cycles, with minimal toxicity, after which the tumor was resected. The examination of the resected specimen revealed a complete pathologic response. He then received a total of 18 cycles of chemotherapy and valproate to complete 1 year of systemic treatment. The child is now 6.5 years of age, disease-free, without evidence of any neurocognitive or developmental abnormalities. Conclusions We suggest that the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be explored in patients with infantile medulloblastoma in whom upfront complete resection is not possible, considering the gratifying results obtained in our case. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

A terminal myelocystocele is a rare form of spinal dysraphism in which the hydromyelic caudal spinal cord and the subarachnoid space are herniated through a posterior spina bifida. In their study of 17 cases, the authors attempt to develop treatment guidelines for patients suffering from this condition. Methods. Seventeen patients (age range 2 months-5 years) underwent surgery during a 7-year period. Surprisingly, nine of 17 patients had no neurological deficits. Among these nine asymptomatic cases, three patients had a dermal sinus and two had a skin dimple, whereas one had congenital talipes equinovarus deformity (CTEV). Among the eight patients with neurological deficits, seven had lower-limb weakness (two had complete paraplegia), and one patient had urinary incontinence and constipation. Four patients each had a dermal sinus and CTEV; interestingly, one infant had an accessory phallus. Radiologically, eight patients had pure myelocystoceles, and a diagnosis of lipomyelocystocele was made in nine instances on the basis of magnetic resonance images. All patients underwent surgery. The meningocele sacs were excised, and the bands tethering the myelocystocele sac to the meningocele sacs were incised, with as little damage to the roots as possible. Two patients experienced postoperative CSF leakage (one required reexploration), and two others had subcutaneous CSF collection. No patient had deterioration of the neurological condition after surgery. Conclusions. The authors present the largest study of patients with terminal myelocystocele to date and emphasize that the possibility of this condition must be kept in mind when addressing all congenital lumbosacral masses.

Our study aims to elucidate the prevalence of incidental findings in a pediatric neurology practice. Methods: We reviewed the charts of 1618 patients seen at a pediatric neurology practice at a tertiary care center from September 2003 to December 2005 for clinical data and incidental intracranial findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging reports. Incidental findings were divided into two categories: normal or abnormal variants. Clinical and demographic data were assessed for associations with incidental findings. Results: From 1618 charts reviewed, only 666 patients (41% of all patients) had brain MRIs ordered. One-hundred and seventy-one (171) patients (25.7% of all patients; 95% CI: 22.6, 29.0) had incidental findings. Of these, 113 (17.0%; 95% CI: 14.1, 19.8) were classified as normal-variants and 58 (8.7%; 95% CI: 6.6, 10.9) were classified as abnormal. The nature of incidental findings was not related to age group, sex or clinical diagnosis (p = 0.29, p = 0.31 and p = 0.69 respectively). Two patients (0.3%; 95% CI: ∼ 0.0, 0.7) required neurosurgical referral. Conclusions: We report a high prevalence of and a low rate of referrals for incidental findings in comparison to previous studies.

The purpose of these experiments was to look for similar patterns in the time series produced by each method to help understand the relationship between the two. The stimulation protocol was the same for both sets of experiments and consisted of five complete cycles of checkerboard pattern reversal at 1.87 Hz for 30 s followed by 30 s of a stationary checkerboard. The fMRI data was analyzed using standard methods, while the EEG was analyzed with a new measurement of activation - the VEPEG. Both VEPEG and fMRI time series contain the fundamental frequency of the stimulus and quasi harmonic components - an unexplained double frequency commonly found in fMRI data. These results have prompted a reappraisal of the methods for analyzing fMRI data and have suggested a connection between our findings and much older published invasive electrophysiological measurements of blood flow and the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Overall our new analysis suggests that fMRI signals are strongly dependant on hydraulic blood flow effects. We distinguish three categories of fMRI signal corresponding to: focal activated regions of brain tissue; diffuse nonspecific regions of steal; and major cerebral vessels of arterial supply or venous drainage.

Here, we present findings from an fMRI study of identity discrimination of faces and objects that demonstrates the FFA and OFA are equally responsive to processing stimuli at the level of individuals (i.e., individuation), be they human faces or non-face objects. The FFA and OFA were defined via a passive viewing task as regions that produced greater activation to faces relative to non-face stimuli within the middle fusiform gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus. In the individuation task, participants judged whether sequentially presented images of faces, diverse objects, or wristwatches depicted the identical or a different exemplar. All three stimulus types produced equivalent BOLD activation within the FFA and OFA; that is, there was no face-specific or face-preferential processing. Critically, individuation processing did not eliminate an object superiority effect relative to faces within a region more closely linked to object processing in the lateral occipital complex (LOC), suggesting that individuation processes are reasonably specific to the FFA and OFA. Taken together, these findings challenge the prevailing view that the FFA and OFA are face-specific processing regions, demonstrating instead that they function to individuate-i.e., identify specific individuals-within a category. These findings have significant implications for understanding the function of brain regions widely believed to play an important role in social cognition.

Functional imaging studies have usually investigated syntax comprehension. However, language production may be performed by different neuronal resources. We have investigated syntax generation on a sentence level with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). BOLD contrast was measured while subjects articulated utterances aloud. In the active condition 'sentence generation' (SG), subjects had to produce subject verb object (SVO) sentences (e.g. ""The child throws the ball"") according to syntactically incomplete stimuli (e.g. ""throw ball child"") presented visually. In the control condition 'word reading' (WR), subjects had to read identical stimuli without completing the syntactic structure, while in a second control condition 'sentence reading' (SR), subjects had to read complete sentences. The semantic meaning of all expressions was obvious despite the syntactically incomplete structure in conditions SG and WR.

This pragmatic information very likely helps children interpret the label correctly. But the importance of gestures may not negate the need for default lexical biases such as the whole object assumption and mutual exclusivity. On this view, children initially assume that a novel label refers to a whole object. If the label for the object is familiar, mutual exclusivity blocks this assumption and frees children to look for a part referent. In this study, the authors taught children part terms by outlining a novel part of a real object. We made mutual exclusivity available by showing children familiar whole objects with novel parts and unavailable by showing unfamiliar whole objects with novel parts. During test, the object was oriented with the part facing away from the child to distinguish pointing to the object from pointing to the part. Both 2-year-olds and 3-year-olds learned more part labels when mutual exclusivity was available. Thus, mutual exclusivity is indispensable even when part labeling is accompanied by naturalistic communicative gestures.

Design: Retrospective study of children with abusive head trauma undergoing clinically indicated continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. Setting: PICU of a tertiary care hospital. Subjects: Children less than or equal to 2 years old with evidence of abusive head trauma determined by neuroimaging, physical examination, and determination of abuse by the Child Protection Team. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Thirty-two children with abusive head trauma were identified with a median age of 4 months (interquartile range 3, 5.5 months). Twenty-one of 32 children (66%) underwent electroencephalographic monitoring. Those monitored were more likely to have a lower admission Glasgow Coma Scale (8 vs 15, p = 0.05) and be intubated (16 vs 2, p = 0.002). Electrographic seizures occurred in 12 of 21 children (57%) and constituted electrographic status epilepticus in 8 of 12 children (67%). Electrographic seizures were entirely nonconvulsive in 8 of 12 children (67%). Electroencephalographic background category (discontinuous and slow-disorganized) (p = 0.02) and neuroimaging evidence of ischemia were associated with the presence of electrographic seizures (p = 0.05). Subjects who had electrographic seizures were no more likely to have clinical seizures at admission (67% electrographic seizures vs 33% none, p = 0.6), parenchymal imaging abnormalities (61% electrographic seizures vs 39% none, p = 0.40), or extra-axial imaging abnormalities (56% electrographic seizures vs 44% none, p = 0.72). Four of 21 (19%) children died prior to discharge; none had electrographic seizures, but all had attenuated-featureless electroencephalographic backgrounds. Follow-up outcome data were available for 16 of 17 survivors at a median duration of 9.5 months following PICU admission, and the presence of electrographic seizures or electrographic status epilepticus was not associated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale score (p = 0.10). Conclusions: Electrographic seizures and electrographic status epilepticus are common in children with abusive head trauma. Most seizures have no clinical correlate. Further study is needed to determine whether seizure identification and management improves outcome. (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2013; 14:709-715).

The reading fluency deficit might be traced back to a scarce integration of orthographic and phonological representations. In order to address this question, the present study used EEG to investigate the N300, an ERP component which has been associated with the integration of orthographic and phonological representations. Twenty children without DD and 18 children with DD performed a phonological (P)-orthographic (O) matching task (P-O condition), which tapped the integration of orthographic and phonological representations. A control task was applied which did not require the integration of orthographic and phonological representations and consisted only of orthographic information (O-O condition). The O-O condition revealed a similar N300 distribution between groups with a bilateral activity over fronto-temporal electrodes. However, in the P-O condition N300 differentiated the 2 groups of children. The control group revealed greater activity over left fronto-temporal electrodes, whereas the N300 was distributed bilaterally in the group of children with DD suggesting deficient integration of orthographic and phonological representations. These findings might be related to the reading fluency deficit as it was also observed that better reading fluency was correlated with higher (r= -36) and earlier peaking (r= -33) N300 amplitudes in the left hemisphere and attenuated N300 amplitudes (r= .45) in the right hemisphere. Standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (sLORETA) revealed that children with DD rely more on right temporo-parietal brain areas compared to children without DD. Furthermore, in order to rule out that earlier deficient processes might influence the group differences found in the N300, we analyzed the N170 for group differences. We did not find significant differences between children without DD and children with DD. In conclusion the results suggest deficient integration of orthographic and phonological representations in dyslexia, as indexed by the N300, and further highlight how this activity is relevant for fluent reading. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,11,11.5,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
"Hauschild, Kathryn M.",2019,databases,A novel gaze based measure of receptive vocabulary and category knowledge in toddlers at a heightened familial risk for autism spectrum disorder,NaN,NaN,"Toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have language, social, and/or communicative deficits (i.e. gaze aversion and reduced understanding of or engagement in gesturing) that become confounds when completing standardized assessments of receptive language. Thus, assessments that rely on parent report or direct interaction with a test administrator may not fully capture the abilities and underlying knowledge of these children. Visual attention based measures of receptive language reduce task demands placed on participants and have been shown to produce a more accurate measure of receptive vocabulary than parent report measures. However, current gaze-based measures employ a visual paired comparison method. When there are only two items, the similarity of the target to the distractor can have a significant impact on the interpretation of task performance. The current study evaluates the feasibility of expanding these looking paradigms to include an eight-item array. This Visual Array Task (VAT) combines the theoretical framework of the Intermodal Preferential Looking Paradigm and Looking-While-Listening methods of receptive language with the sequential touching paradigm of object categorization. The use of a larger array of items and the inclusion of a superordinate category contrast could provide a more sensitive measure of receptive language as well as a better understanding of the extent to which early word comprehension reflects knowledge of broader categories. Results indicate that the tested VAT was both a sensitive measure of receptive vocabulary as well as capable of reflecting gains in category knowledge. This paradigm provides researchers with an inexpensive and efficient task to measure receptive language as well as other general constructs such as category knowledge while reducing behavioral demands placed on the participant. Data here validate the feasibly of using the task to measure receptive vocabulary and category knowledge in children at genetic risk for ASD. Without modification, the VAT can accommodate the testing of minimally verbal to non-verbal populations, as well as populations, such as children with anxiety, that may encounter many of the interaction-based hurdles similar to children with ASD. Thus, the VAT is measure that can be administered uniformly across a broad spectrum of populations.

Recent advances in neuroimaging have facilitated the examination of brain development, and have allowed for the exploration of the relationships between the development of emotion processing abilities, and that of associated neural systems. Methods: A literature review was performed of published studies examining the development of emotion expression recognition in normal children and psychiatric populations, and of the development of neural systems important for emotion processing. Results: Few studies have explored the development of emotion expression recognition throughout childhood and adolescence. Behavioural studies suggest continued development throughout childhood and adolescence (reflected by accuracy scores and speed of processing), which varies according to the category of emotion displayed. Factors such as sex, socio-economic status, and verbal ability may also affect this development. Functional neuroimaging studies in adults highlight the role of the amygdala in emotion processing. Results of the few neuroimaging studies in children have focused on the role of the amygdala in the recognition of fearful expressions. Although results are inconsistent, they provide evidence throughout childhood and adolescence for the continued development of and sex differences in amygdalar function in response to fearful expressions. Studies exploring emotion expression recognition in psychiatric populations of children and adolescents suggest deficits that are specific to the type of disorder and to the emotion displayed. Conclusions: Results from behavioural and neuroimaging studies indicate continued development of emotion expression recognition and neural regions important for this process throughout childhood and adolescence. Methodological inconsistencies and disparate findings make any conclusion difficult, however. Further studies are required examining the relationship between the development of emotion expression recognition and that of underlying neural systems, in particular subcortical and prefrontal cortical structures.

Methods: An explicit emotion-matching task was employed in which children matched the emotion of a target individual, and an implicit task whereby participants ignored the emotive facial stimulus and matched identity. Four intensities (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) for each of five emotion categories (sad, anger, happy, fear, and disgust) were included and provided a novel avenue of emotion-processing exploration. Results: Increasing age significantly improved children's performance on both tasks, particularly for fear and disgust. Age was not associated with more subtle processing (i.e., lower intensity of expression). When explicitly matching emotion expressions, increasing intensity was associated with improved performance. When matching identities (implicit emotion-matching), emotion category and intensity influenced task performance. Sex effects were minimal. Conclusions: In children, age, facial expression intensity and emotion category are important for predicting accuracy on emotion-processing tasks. Emotion category and expression intensity differentially affect performance on explicit and implicit emotion-processing tasks.

Participants viewed category-specific stimuli (Place and Body images) to localize the extrastriate body area (EBA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA). Then, they observed a computerized character viewing each stimulus category, occluded from the participant's view. In support of the Content Specific Attribution hypothesis, whole-brain analyses revealed that viewing someone else looking at an occluded picture of a body activated brain regions previously associated with components of social cognition more than viewing someone else looking at an occluded picture of a place. Counter to the Dual Role hypothesis, functional region of interest (ROI) analyses revealed that the EBA and PPA were not clearly involved in representing what the character was seeing.

While previous eye-tracking and behavioral findings support the usefulness of the paradigm, it remains to be shown that the paradigm actually relies on the brain networks for occulomotor control and attention, but not on systems for lexical/syntactic/orthographic processing. Here, 20 healthy volunteers underwent fMRI scanning while reading sentences (with syntax) or unconnected lists of written stimuli (no syntax) consisting of words (with semantics) or pseudowords (no semantics). In an additional 'Landolt reading' condition, all letters were replaced by closed circles, which should be scanned for targets (Landolt’s rings) in a reading-like fashion from left to right. A conjunction analysis of all five conditions revealed the visual scanning network which involved bilateral visual cortex, premotor cortex, and superior parietal cortex, but which did not include regions for semantics, syntax, or orthography. Contrasting the Landolt reading condition with all other regions revealed additional involvement of the right superior parietal cortex (areas 7A/7P/7PC) and postcentral gyrus (area 2) involved in deliberate gaze shifting. These neuroimaging findings demonstrate for the first time that the linguistic and orthographic brain network can be dissociated from a pure gaze-orienting network with the Landolt paradigm. Consequently, the Landolt paradigm may provide novel insights into the contributions of linguistic and non-linguistic factors on reading failure e.g., in developmental dyslexia.

At least half of hyperactive children develop ODD and about a third CD (i.e. AD/HD + CD or HKCD) before puberty. About half of children with this combined problem constellation develop antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in adulthood.

"Holcomb, Erin Marie",2014,databases,Assessment of the semantic knowledge network in older adults with familial history of alzheimer's disease,NaN,NaN,"Current techniques for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease rely on early implementation, which necessitates the need for accurate and early identification of individuals most at risk for future cognitive decline. Research has demonstrated the usefulness of examining the temporal gradient for long-term semantic knowledge in identification of such individuals. The assessment of the temporal gradient within varying levels of knowledge specificity, however, has received considerably less attention. In this study, we aimed to contrast accuracy and reaction times for semantic memory tasks tapping multiple dimensions of semantic specificity from multiple time epochs in adult children with and without a parental history of AD. Two supplementary aims involved: 1) examination of the integrative effects of age of memory (i.e., the temporal gradient) and specificity of information on the organization of famous person knowledge in older adults and 2) whether these effects could also be used to understand the organizational structure of conceptual word knowledge. While no group differences were observed on our novel tasks, we believe that understanding task performance at this stage is of benefit for future studies. The potential use of similar tasks in neuroimaging studies is discussed within the context of literature documenting the utility of brain activation patterns during semantic memory tasks. Finally, behavioral performance on our tasks indicates that both the age of memory and specificity of knowledge are influential in the organization of semantic networks for person knowledge. Performance on conceptual word knowledge tasks, however, does not produce a similar temporal gradient for long-term memory. We believe that this is due to the integration of episodic/autobiographical networks during recall of person knowledge. Theoretical implications of these findings for understanding the encoding and consolidation processes of long-term memory circuits and hippocampal involvement in semantic memory formation are discussed.

Our aim was to determine the influence of mood versus behavioral dysregulation on reading ability and neural correlates supporting these skills in youth, using diffusion tensor imaging in 11- to 17-year-old children and youths with mood disorders or behavioral disorders and age-matched healthy controls. The three groups differed only in phonological processing and passage comprehension. Youth with mood disorders scored higher on the phonological test but had lower comprehension scores than children with behavioral disorders and controls; control participants scored the highest. Correlations between fractional anisotropy and phonological processing in the left Arcuate Fasciculus showed a significant difference between groups and were strongest in behavioral disorders, intermediate in mood disorders, and lowest in controls. Correlations between these measures in the left Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus were significantly greater than in controls for mood but not for behavioral disorders. Youth with mood disorders share a deficit in the executive-limbic pathway (Arcuate Fasciculus) with behavioral-disordered youth, suggesting reduced capacity for engaging frontal regions for phonological processing or passage comprehension tasks and increased reliance on the ventral tract (e.g., the Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus). The low passage comprehension scores in mood disorder may result from engaging the left hemisphere. Neural pathways for reading differ mainly in executive-limbic circuitry. This new insight may aid clinicians in providing appropriate intervention for each disorder. © 2017",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,13.91,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The most severe category of influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE) is acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), characterized by high frequency of neurologic sequelae and fatal outcomes. We report two young siblings who developed fever and seizures with altered mental status. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection was identified in upper respiratory tract specimens from both patients, and neuroimaging revealed bilateral inflammatory lesions, consistent with acute necrotizing encephalopathy. Neither child had received influenza vaccination. Both children progressed to critical illness and required invasive mechanical ventilation. In addition to critical care management, both patients received high-dose corticosteroids, mannitol, anticonvulsants, and antiviral treatment of influenza.

Imaging with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWi) demonstrates that the acute cerebral injury and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) allow the assessment of the severity of brain damage. The main objective was to examine if spatial distribution of reductions in ADC values is associated with clinical outcome in drowned children. Methods This is a retrospective study of 7 children (7 examinations) suffering from a hypoxic-ischemic event who underwent DWi. Seven subjects with normal DWi served as controls. The mean patient age was 4.88 ± 2.93 years and the male-to-female ratio was 5:2. The neurological outcome was divided into 2 categories: 4 children with Apallic syndrome and 3 deaths. We analysed the differences between the drowned children and the control group regarding clinical data, DWi abnormalities, and ADC values. Results The ADC values in the occipital and parietal grey matter were significantly different between the drowned children (765.14 ± 65.47 vs 920.95 ± 69.62; P = .003) and the control group (670.82 ± 233.99 vs 900.66 ± 92.72; P = .005). The ADC showed low values in the precentral area also (P = .044). Conclusion The ADC reduction may be useful to predict the poor outcome in drowned children and can be a valuable tool for clinical assessment. © 2016 Canadian Association of Radiologists",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,4.92,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We demonstrate the feasibility and utility of a 3D non-Cartesian radial acquisition in children. Purpose: To compare bulk motion artifacts, image quality, and lesion conspicuity in 3D T1-weighted post-contrast brain MRI between a new fat-suppressed radial gradient-echo and a traditional non-fat-suppressed inversion-recovery Cartesian gradient-echo sequence. Material and methods: Images from 53 patients acquired at 3 Tesla were compared. Three radiologists rated the images in three categories, including the presence of bulk motion and whether it impacted diagnosis, whether one sequence was preferred over the other in overall image quality and conspicuity of vascular structures and lesions, and whether diagnosis was possible if only the new fat-suppressed radial acquisition was obtained. Results: The Fleiss' kappa for inter-rater agreement was 0.67 for bulk motion and 0.54 for sequence preference. Of the 53 cases, 56% were identified to have significant motion on conventional imaging, while only 13% had motion artifacts on the radial acquisition (p < 0.05). There were no cases where motion was seen on the radial acquisition but not on conventional imaging. Both sequences were equally preferred in 87% of the cases. All radiologists agreed that the radial approach had lower gray-white matter contrast than the conventional inversion-recovery method, but preferred the former for making diagnosis in uncooperative patients. Conclusion: We demonstrate the potential utility of a fat-suppressed 3D T1-weighted post-contrast brain gradient-echo sequence in children. The technique is useful in non-sedate pediatric imaging due to its reduced sensitivity to bulk motion. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,12.4,19,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we provide the first direct statistically based investigation into how the effect of dyslexia on brain activation is influenced by the Chinese and English writing systems. Brain activation for semantic decisions on written words was compared in English dyslexics, Chinese dyslexics, English normal readers and Chinese normal readers, while controlling for all other experimental parameters. By investigating the effects of dyslexia and language in one study, we show common activation in Chinese and English dyslexics despite different activation in Chinese versus English normal readers. The effect of dyslexia in both languages was observed as less than normal activation in the left angular gyrus and in left middle frontal, posterior temporal and occipitotemporal regions. Differences in Chinese and English normal reading were observed as increased activation for Chinese relative to English in the left inferior frontal sulcus; and increased activation for English relative to Chinese in the left posterior superior temporal sulcus. These cultural differences were not observed in dyslexics who activated both left inferior frontal sulcus and left posterior superior temporal sulcus, consistent with the use of culturally independent strategies when reading is less efficient. By dissociating the effect of dyslexia from differences in Chinese and English normal reading, our results reconcile brain activation results with a substantial body of behavioural studies showing commonalities in the cognitive manifestation of dyslexia in Chinese and English populations. They also demonstrate the influence of cognitive ability and learning environment on a common neural system for reading. © The Author(s) 2010.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,13.6,14.3,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

By contrast patients with very early hippocampal damage and developmental amnesia are not impaired relative to control participants when imagining fictitious/future experiences. Recently, however, a patient (HC) with developmental amnesia, resulting from bilateral hippocampal atrophy, was reported to be impaired, thus raising a question about the true nature of event construction in the context of developmental amnesia. Here, we assessed HC on a test of imagination which explored her ability to construct fictitious events or personal plausible future events. Her scenario descriptions were analysed in detail along a range of parameters, using two different scoring methods. HC’s performance was comparable to matched control participants on all measures relating to the imagination of fictitious and future scenarios. We then considered why she was reported as impaired in the previous study. We conclude that various features of the previous testing methodology may have contributed to the underestimation of HC’s ability in that instance. Patients like HC with developmental amnesia may be successful at future-thinking tasks because their performance is not based on true visualisation or scene construction supported by the hippocampus, but rather on preserved world knowledge and semantic representations.

Although parent-child reading has been shown in behavioral studies to improve oral language and print concepts, quantifiable effects on the brain have not been previously studied. Our study used blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the relationship between home reading environment and brain activity during a story listening task in a sample of preschool-age children. We hypothesized that while listening to stories, children with greater home reading exposure would exhibit higher activation of left-sided brain regions involved with semantic processing (extraction of meaning). METHODS: Nineteen 3-to 5-year-old children were selected from a longitudinal study of normal brain development. All completed blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging using an age-appropriate story listening task, where narrative alternated with tones. We performed a series of whole-brain regression analyses applying composite, subscale, and individual reading-related items from the validated StimQ-P measure of home cognitive environment as explanatory variables for neural activation. RESULTS: Higher reading exposure (StimQ-P Reading subscale score) was positively correlated (P <.05, corrected) with neural activation in the left-sided parietal-temporal-occipital association cortex, a ""hub"" region supporting semantic language processing, controlling for household income. CONCLUSIONS: In preschool children listening to stories, greater home reading exposure is positively associated with activation of brain areas supporting mental imagery and narrative comprehension, controlling for household income. These neural biomarkers may help inform eco-bio-developmental models of emergent literacy. © 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,3.6,5,NaN,auditory story listening vs. tones,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

It is still a matter of debate, whether these divergent eye movement patterns of dyslexic readers reflect an underlying problem in word processing or whether they are - as the proponents of the magnocellular deficit hypothesis claim - associated with deficient visual perception that is causal for dyslexia. To overcome problems in the empirical linkage of the magnocellular theory with reading, a string processing task is presented that poses similar demands on visual perception (in terms of letter identification) and oculomotor control as reading does. Two experiments revealed no differences in the eye movement patterns of dyslexic and control readers performing this task. Furthermore, no relationship between the functionality of the participants' magnocellular system assessed by the coherent motion task and string processing were found. The perceptual and oculomotor demands required during string processing were functionally equivalent to those during reading and the presented consonant strings had similar visual characteristics as reading material. Thus, a strong inference can be drawn: Dyslexic readers do not seem to have difficulties with the accurate perception of letters and the control of their eye movements during reading - their reading difficulties therefore cannot be explained in terms of oculomotor and visuo-perceptual problems. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated whether a history of childhood enuresis, a well-established marker of neurodevelopmental delay, is associated with SCZ and with measures of brain abnormalities also associated with SCZ. A Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) based history of enuresis, volumetric brain MRI scans and neuropsychological testing were obtained in patients with SCZ, their non-psychotic siblings (SIB) and non-psychiatric controls (NC). The subjects were 211 patients (79.6% male), 234 of their SIB (43.2% male) and 355 controls (39.2% male). Frequency of enuresis was compared across groups and correlated with cognitive measures. Total and regional brain volumes were determined using voxel-based morphometry on matched subsets of probands (n = 82) with or without enuresis (n = 16, n = 66, respectively) and controls (n = 102) with or without enuresis (n = 11, n = 91, respectively). Patients with SCZ had higher rates of childhood enuresis (21%) compared with SIB (11%; χ² = 6.42, P = 0.01) or controls (7%; χ² = 23.65, P < 0.0001) and relative risk for enuresis was increased in SIB (λs = 2.62). Patients with enuresis performed worse on two frontal lobe cognitive tests [Letter Fluency (t = 1.97, P = 0.05, df = 200) and Category Fluency (t = 2.15, P = 0.03, df = 200)] as compared with non-enuretic patients. Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed grey matter volume reductions in several frontal regions (right BA 9, right BA 10 and bilateral BA 45) and right superior parietal cortex (BA 7) in patients with a history of enuresis as compared with non-enuretic patients (all t > 3.57, all P < 0.001). The high frequency of childhood enuresis associated with SCZ and abnormalities in prefrontal function and structure in patients with a childhood history of enuresis suggest that childhood enuresis may be a premorbid marker for neurodevelopmental abnormalities related to SCZ. These findings add to the evidence implicating prefrontal dysmaturation in this disorder, potentially related to genetic risk factors.

Here, we present our experience in the surgical management of OLE in children using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in the pre-operative evaluation. Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed from 2000 to 2010 to identify patients with OLE. Patients were analyzed in two categories: isolated OLE (11 patients) and extended OLE (parietooccipital, temporooccipital, and temporoparietooccipital; 30 patients). Survival analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression were used to identify independent predictors of seizure outcome. Results: Forty-one patients with a mean follow-up of 3.1 years were identified with an overall 68% rate of satisfactory seizure outcome. Patients with extended OLE had younger ages at seizure onset and different seizure semiologies compared with those with isolated OLE. None of the latter underwent insertion of subdural grid electrodes for localization of the epileptogenic zone compared with 77% of the former (p< 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the strongest independent predictor of unsatisfactory outcome was MEG dipoles in the occipital lobe contralateral to resection.

However, it can sometimes be more  useful not to compute a single summary description for all of the objects if they  are substantially different, for example when they belong to entirely different  categories. It was proposed that the visual system can efficiently use the  distributional information of ensembles to decide whether simultaneously displayed  items belong to single or several different categories. Here we directly tested how  the feature distribution of items in a visual array affects an ability to  discriminate individual items (Experiment 1) and sets (Experiments 2-3) when  participants were instructed explicitly to categorize individual objects based on  the median of size distribution. We varied the width (narrow or fat) as well as the  shape (smooth or two-peaked) of distributions in order to manipulate the ease of  ensemble extraction from the items. We found that observers unintentionally relied  on the grand mean as a natural categorical boundary and that their categorization  accuracy increased as a function of the size differences among individual items and  a function of their separation from the grand mean. For ensembles drawn from  two-peaked size distributions, participants showed better categorization  performance. They were more accurate at judging within-category ensemble properties  in other dimensions (centroid and orientation) and less biased by superset  statistics. This finding corroborates the idea that the two-peaked feature  distributions support the ""segmentability"" of spatially intermixed sets of objects.

However, in this research, it was used not only for detecting the eye artifacts, but also for detecting the brain-produced signals of two conceptual danger and information category words. In this cross-sectional research, electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded using Micromed and 19-channel helmet devices in unipolar mode, wherein Cz electrode was selected as the reference electrode. In the first part of this research, the statistical community test case included four men and four women, who were 25-30 years old. In the designed task, three groups of traffic signs were considered, in which two groups referred to the concept of danger, and the third one referred to the concept of information. In the second part, the three volunteers, two men and one woman, who had the best results, were chosen from among eight participants. In the second designed task, direction arrows (up, down, left, and right) were used. For the 2/8 volunteers in the rest times, very high-power alpha waves were observed from the back of the head; however, in the thinking times, they were different. According to this result, alpha waves for changing the task from thinking to rest condition took at least 3 s for the two volunteers, and it was at most 5 s until they went to the absolute rest condition. For the 7/8 volunteers, the danger and information signals were well classified; these differences for the 5/8 volunteers were observed in the right hemisphere, and, for the other three volunteers, the differences were observed in the left hemisphere. For the second task, simulations showed that the best classification accuracies resulted when the time window was 2.5 s. In addition, it also showed that the features of the autoregressive (AR)-15 model coefficients were the best choices for extracting the features. For all the states of neural network except hardlim discriminator function, the classification accuracies were almost the same and not very different. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in comparison with the neural network yielded higher classification accuracies. ICA is a suitable algorithm for recognizing of the word's concept and its place in the brain. Achieved results from this experiment were the same compared with the results from other methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and methods based on the brain signals (EEG) in the vowel imagination and covert speech.

Meta-regression models of NAA and Cr levels were employed, using data from 20 eligible studies (N0852), to investigate age-dependent differences in both global brain and region-specific metabolite levels, while controlling for measurementmethod (Cr-ratio versus absolute concentrations). Decreased NAA concentrations that were specific to children were found for whole-brain grey and white matter. In addition, a significant decrease in NAA was evident across age categories in the parietal cortex, the cerebellum, and the anterior cingulate cortex. Higher levels of Cr were observed for ASD adults than children in global grey matter, with specific increases for adults in the temporal lobe and decreased Cr in the occipital lobe in children. No differences were found for either NAA or Cr in the frontal lobes. These data provide some evidence that ASD is characterized by age-dependent fluctuations in metabolite levels across the whole brain and at the level of specific regions thought to underlie ASD-associated behavioural and affective deficits. Differences in Cr as a function of age and brain region suggests caution in the interpretation of Cr-based ratio measures of metabolites. Despite efforts to control for sources of heterogeneity, considerable variability in metabolite levels was observed in frontal and temporal regions, warranting further investigation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The neurocognitive substrates supporting  autobiographical recall of recent events and working memory in younger, recently  diagnosed individuals with OSA appear to be indistinguishable from healthy  age-matched individuals. These findings point to the importance of early diagnosis  and treatment of OSA in order to preserve cognitive function.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,25.3,61,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

A comparison between groups suggested atypical patterns of brain activation for the individuals with Down syndrome. Correlation analyses between an index of visual spatial ability and brain activation depicted a positive relationship between (a) this index and brain activation in regions of the occipital and parietal lobes for the typically developing individuals and (b) the middle and dorsal frontal gyri in the individuals with Down syndrome. These findings supported the authors' hypothesis that persons with Down syndrome demonstrate atypical neural activation compared with typically developing individuals matched for chronological age. © American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,19,26,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

"Jankowski, Kathryn Felice",2018,databases,Neurobiological foundations of self-conscious emotion understanding in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders,NaN,NaN,"This dissertation explored the subjective experience and neural correlates of self-conscious emotion (SCE) understanding in adolescent males with high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and age-matched neurotypical (NT) males (ages 11-17). Study I investigated group differences in SCE attributions (the ability to recognize SCEs conveyed by others) and empathic SCEs (the ability/tendency to feel empathic SCEs for others) in 56 adolescents (ASD = 30; NT = 26). It also explored associations between SCE processing and a triad of social cognitive abilities (self-awareness/introspection, perspective-taking/cognitive empathy, affective empathy) and autistic symptoms/traits. Study II investigated the neural correlates of SCE processing in 52 adolescents (ASD = 27; NT = 25). During an MRI scan, participants completed the Self-Conscious Emotions Task-Child, which included 24 salient, ecologically-valid videos of adolescents participating in a singing competition. Videos represented two factors: emotion (embarrassment, pride) and perspective-taking (PT) demands (low, high). In low PT clips, singers' emotions matched their performance (sing poorly, act embarrassed); in high PT clips, they did not (sing well, act embarrassed). Participants used a 4-point Likert scale to rate how intensely embarrassed and proud singers felt. They made congruent ratings, which matched the conveyed emotions (rating how embarrassed an embarrassed singer felt), and incongruent ratings, which did not match the conveyed emotions (rating how proud an embarrassed singer felt). Outside the scanner, participants rated how empathically embarrassed and proud they felt for the singers. The ASD and NT groups made similarly intense inferred congruent and empathic congruent SCE ratings, suggesting that emotion attribution and affective empathy are intact in ASD. However, the ASD group made more intense inferred incongruent SCE ratings, suggesting that emotion attribution in ASD may be more strongly impacted by the situational context. An over-reliance on contextual cues may reflect a strict adherence to rule-following and serve as a compensatory strategy for attenuated mentalizing. Neuroimaging results support this interpretation. The ASD group recruited atypical neural patterns within social cognition regions, visual perception regions, salience regions, and sensorimotor regions. These findings similarly suggest an over-reliance on abstract social conceptual knowledge when processing discrepant affective and contextual cues. Implications for intervention are discussed.

Methods: Patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were included from 2010 to 2014 based on a diagnosis of CHNM using ICD O-3 histology codes and primary site location documentation. Patients were also included if they had a “yes” or “no” documented in the “Mets at Dx–Brain” category. Results: In this study, 46 out of 19,066 (0.2%) patients diagnosed with CHNM presented with brain metastasis at diagnosis. Of the 19,066 patients, 14,124 (74.1%) were male. Caucasian race was noted in 18,299 cases (96.0%). 16.8% of patients with AJCC 7 Stage IV/M1 CHNM had brain metastasis at the time of diagnosis as compared to 0% in Stage I-III/M0 lesions (p <.001). Conclusions and relevance: The 2018 NCCN guidelines recommend healthcare providers consider ordering a baseline brain MRI for patients with stage IIIC or greater melanoma. This study demonstrates the very low frequency of brain metastasis at time of diagnosis in patients with CHNM and supports the NCCN recommendations demonstrating that only very advanced stages of CHNM require baseline brain imaging. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In this study, event-related potentials (ERP) were used to examine whether the N400 wave in dyslexic children is modulated by phonological or semantic priming, similarly to age-matched controls. ERPs were recorded while children listened to word lists in which the semantic and phonological congruency of the terminal words were manipulated. No overt judgments were made by participants. In control children the N400 amplitude to both semantically and phonologically incongruent words was enlarged relative to congruent words. Dyslexic children exhibited a dissociation of priming effects depending on whether semantic or phonological primes were used. Semantic priming elicited an N400 effect comparable to controls, though delayed. In phonological priming, the dyslexics differed from controls in both the phonologically incongruent and congruent conditions showing reduced N400 amplitude in the former and enhanced N400 in the latter. This pattern suggests that when faced with phonological priming, dyslexics show abnormal neural responses related to both integration of similarities between the consecutive stimuli and the ability to detect incongruent stimuli. Semantic priming seems relatively intact in dyslexics, however neural responses to contextual incongruency are delayed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,9.11,10,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

However, evidence showing which neural mechanisms underlie changes in cognitive skills in another domain following musical training has remained sparse. Syntax processing in language and music has been shown to rely on overlapping neural resources, and this study compared the neural correlates of language- and music-syntactic processing between children with and without long-term musical training. Musically trained children had larger amplitudes of the ERAN (early right anterior negativity), elicited by music-syntactic irregularities. Furthermore, the ELAN (early left anterior negativity), a neurophysiological marker of syntax processing in language, was more strongly developed in these children, and they furthermore had an enlarged amplitude of a later negativity, assumed to reflect more sustained syntax processing. Thus, our data suggest that the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying syntax processing in music and language are developed earlier, and more strongly, in children with musical training. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The clinical picture of this lesion is notable for epileptic seizures and intracerebral hemorrhage. Surgical excision of cavernoma remains the most effective antiepileptic modality. Good results of surgery are achieved with the use of modern operative procedures such as stereotaxy and neuronavigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve patients with cavernous hemangioma were operated at the Department of Neurosurgery and Pediatric Neurosurgery, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, between 1999 and 2008. This group included 10 females aged 7-54 years (mean 24.8 years) and 2 males aged 14-49 years (mean 31.5 years), 7 children (58.3%) and 5 adults (41.7%). Seven patients (58.3%) presented with generalized and the remaining 5 patients (41.7%) with secondarily generalized seizures. The mean time from onset of seizures to surgery was 2.6 months. All patients were operated using preoperative neuronavigated mapping to determine the optimal access to the lesion followed by neuronavigation-guided cavernoma excision. Postoperative neurological status was assessed with GOS scale and antiepileptic treatment outcome with Engel's scale as modified by Moran. RESULTS: The caveroma was completely removed in each case. Postoperative follow-up time was 2-59 months (mean 30.3 months). Neurological status of all patients was category 5 of the GOS scale. Engel's class I outcome was achieved in all patients. Nine patients (75%) were weaned off antiepileptic drugs following normalization of EEG. CONCLUSIONS: The following conclusions were drawn basing on the findings of this study: (1) Neuronavigation offers high precision and low traumatization which reduce the risk of neurological sequellae (neurological deficits and epilepsy) in patients operated for cavernoma; (2) Early resection of cavernoma offers the chance of curing epilepsy.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Patients and methods: A retrospective analysis was made of 312 patients with cranial nerve injury among 3417 TBI patients, who were admitted for treatment in this hospital. Results: A total of 312 patients (9.1%) involving either a single nerve or multiple nerves among the 12 pairs of cranial nerves were observed. The extent of nerve injury varied and involved the olfactory nerve (66 cases), optic nerve (78 cases), oculomotor nerve (56 cases), trochlear nerve (8 cases), trigeminal nerve (4 cases), abducent nerve (12 cases), facial nerve (48 cases), acoustic nerve (10 cases), glossopharyngeal nerve (8 cases), vagus nerve (6 cases), accessory nerve (10 cases) and hypoglossal nerve (6 cases). Imaging examination revealed skull fracture in 217 cases, complicated brain contusion in 232 cases, epidural haematoma in 194 cases, subarachnoid haemorrhage in 32 cases, nasal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage in 76 cases and ear CSF leakage in 8 cases. Of the 312 patients, 46 patients died; the mortality rate associated with low cranial nerve injury was as high as 73.3%. Among the 266 surviving patients, 199 patients received conservative therapy and 67 patients received surgical therapy; the curative rates among these two groups were 61.3% (122 patients) and 86.6% (58 patients), respectively. Conclusion: TBI-complicated cranial nerve injury is subject to a high incidence rate, a high mortality rate and a high disability rate. Our findings suggest that the chance of recovery may be increased in cases where injuries are amenable to surgical decompression. It is necessary to study all 12 pairs of cranial nerves systematically. Clinically, it is necessary to standardise surgical indications, operation timing, surgical approaches and methods for the treatment of TBI-complicated cranial nerve injury. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we examined how transdiagnostic symptoms of irritability relate to the development of structural brain networks. All participants (n = 137, 83 females) completed structural brain imaging with 3 Tesla MRI at two timepoints (mean age at follow-up: 21.1 years, mean inter-scan interval: 5.2 years). Irritability at follow-up was assessed using the Affective Reactivity Index, and cortical thickness was quantified using Advanced Normalization Tools software. Structural covariance networks were delineated using non-negative matrix factorization, a multivariate analysis technique. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with irritability at follow-up were evaluated using generalized additive models with penalized splines. The False Discovery Rate (q < 0.05) was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Cross-sectional analysis of follow-up data revealed that 11 of the 24 covariance networks were associated with irritability, with higher levels of irritability being associated with thinner cortex. Longitudinal analyses further revealed that accelerated cortical thinning within nine networks was related to irritability at follow-up. Effects were particularly prominent in brain regions implicated in emotion regulation, including the orbitofrontal, lateral temporal, and medial temporal cortex. Collectively, these findings suggest that irritability is associated with widespread reductions in cortical thickness and accelerated cortical thinning, particularly within the frontal and temporal cortex. Aberrant structural maturation of regions important for emotional regulation may in part underlie symptoms of irritability. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,16,22,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

About one third of children with NF1 have attentional disorders, and the cognitive phenotype is characterized by impairment in prefrontally mediated functions. Mouse models of NF1 show irregularities in gamma-aminobutyric acid release and striatal dopamine metabolism. We hypothesized that youths with NF1 would show abnormal behavior and neural activity on a task of risk taking reliant on prefrontal-striatal circuits. Methods Youths with NF1 (n = 29) and demographically comparable healthy control subjects (n = 22), aged 8 to 19 years, were administered a developmentally sensitive gambling task in which they chose between low-risk gambles with a high probability of obtaining a small reward and high-risk gambles with a low probability of obtaining a large reward. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural activity associated with risky decision making as well as age-associated changes in these behavioral and neural processes. Results Behaviorally, youths with NF1 tended to make fewer risky decisions than control subjects. Neuroimaging analyses revealed significantly reduced neural activity across multiple brain regions involved in higher-order semantic processing and motivation (i.e., anterior cingulate, paracingulate, supramarginal, and angular gyri) in patients with NF1 relative to control subjects during the task.

METHODS: We included 953 children between 5 and 14 years of age who were screened with MRI of the brain for the Silent Infarct Transfusion Trial. All had sickle cell anemia or sickle β-null thalassemia. MRI scans were interpreted by 3 neuroradiologists. MRI scans reported to have any abnormality were reviewed by 2 study neuroradiologists. Incidental findings were classified into 4 categories, that is, no, routine, urgent, or immediate referral recommended. Cerebral infarctions and vascular lesions were not considered incidental and were excluded. RESULTS: We identified 63 children (6.6% [95% confidence interval: 5.1%- 8.4%]) with 68 incidental intracranial MRI findings. Findings were classified as urgent in 6 cases (0.6%), routine in 25 cases (2.6%), and no referral required in 32 cases (3.4%). No children required immediate referral. Two children with urgent findings underwent surgery in the subsequent 6 months. CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of children, incidental intracranial findings were identified for 6.6%, with potentially serious or urgent findings for 0.6%.

A review with special reference to endocrine manifestations,Acta Oncologica,https://doi.org/10.3109/0284186X.2011.586000,"Epidemiology. Intracranial germ cell tumours (icGCTs) represent 315% of primary paediatric intracranial neoplasms with a considerable geographical variation in incidence. Ninety percent of patients diagnosed with icGCTs are under 20 years of age. Pathology. Histologic characteristics and investigation of the tumour markers β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) help define the different categories of icGCTs. The tumours are divided into two major groups called germinomas and non-germinomatous GCTs (NGGCTs). Clinical presentation. The clinical symptoms depend on the size and location of tumour in the brain, which is most commonly in the pineal or suprasellar region. Pineal GCTs often present with neurological symptoms because of their tendency to cause increased intracranial pressure. Suprasellar GCTs are often accompanied by endocrine abnormalities such as diabetes insipidus (DI), growth retardation and precocious or delayed puberty. Diagnosis. A combination of clinical findings, endocrine and tumour marker evaluation, spinal fluid cytology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biopsy helps verifying the diagnosis of an icGCT. A summary of published data (n = 97) revealed that >90% of patients at diagnosis had at least one endocrine abnormality, DI being the most common (>80%). Treatment. Classification of tumour is important for choice of treatment and for prognosis. A combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is often used, since most icGCTs have a great sensitivity to these treatment modalities. Conclusion. Endocrine symptoms are very frequently appearing in patients with icGCTs and they can present long before neuroimaging verification of tumour is possible. It is of the outmost importance to have the diagnosis of icGCTs in mind when children, adolescents and young adults are presenting with endocrine irregularities, because most icGCTs are very sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and early onset of treatment is important in order to minimize morbidity and mortality. © 2012 Informa Healthcare.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The aim of this study was to estimate the accuracy of routine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies in the classification of brain tumors in terms of both cell type and grade of malignancy. Methods. The authors retrospectively assessed the correlation between neuroimaging classifications and histopathological diagnoses by using multicenter database records from 393 patients with brain tumors. An ontology was devised to establish diagnostic agreement. Each tumor category was compared with the corresponding histopathological diagnoses by dichotomization. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPVs and NPVs, respectively), and the Wilson 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each were calculated. In routine reporting of MR imaging examinations, tumor types and grades were classified with a high specificity (85.2-100%); sensitivity varied, depending on the tumor type and grade, alone or in combination. The recognition of broad diagnostic categories (neuroepithelial or meningeal lesions) was highly sensitive, whereas when both detailed type and grade were considered, sensitivity diverged, being highest in low-grade meningioma (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 96.2-100.0%) and lowest in high-grade meningioma (sensitivity 0.0%, 95% CI 0.0-65.8%) and low-grade oligodendroglioma (sensitivity 15%, 95% CI 5.2-36.0%). In neuroepithelial tumors, sensitivity was inversely related to the precision in reporting of grade and cellular origin; ""glioma"" was a frequent neuroimaging classification associated with higher sensitivity in the corresponding category. The PPVs varied among categories, in general being greater than their prevalence in this dataset. The NPV was high in all categories (69.8-100%). Conclusions. The PPVs and NPVs provided in this study may be used as estimates of posttest probabilities of diagnostic accuracy using MR imaging. This study targets the need for noninvasively increasing sensitivity in categorizing most brain tumor types while retaining high specificity, especially in the differentiation of high- and low-grade glial tumor classes.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,53,85,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

This study investigated the event-related potentials (ERP) responses of nine-month-olds on basic level picture-word pairings. After a familiarization phase of six picture-word pairings per semantic category, comprehension for novel exemplars was tested in a picture-word matching paradigm. ERPs time-locked to pictures elicited a modulation of the Negative Central (Nc) component, associated with visual attention and recognition. It was attenuated by category repetition as well as by the type-token ratio of picture context. ERPs time-locked to words in the training phase became more negative with repetition (N300-600), but there was no influence of picture type-token ratio, suggesting that infants have identified the concept of each picture before a word was presented. Results from the test phase provided clear support that infants integrated word meanings with (novel) picture context. Here, infants showed different ERP responses for words that did or did not align with the picture context: a phonological mismatch (N200) and a semantic mismatch (N400).

Recently, it has been reported that in grapheme-colour synaesthesia, the colour associated to a letter is chosen by similarity to other letters. Letters of similar shapes tend to elicit similar colours. The authors explained this result by low-level cross-wiring between grapheme and colour brain areas. In the present study we show that when new graphemes are learned, they also associate synaesthetic colours based on shape- and colour similarity. Importantly, these novel associations between graphemes and colors are created within minutes, which is too rapid to be accounted for by cross-wiring. In addition, the dimensions of similarity used to create these associations were more abstract than what would be expected from elementary features processed in the grapheme area. Therefore, we conclude that the result is better explained by high-level conceptual mechanisms that guide the choices and creation of synaesthetic concurrents. © 2012 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,32.7,53,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We discuss how this powerful combination could be used to explore changing brain–ehaviour relationships throughout development in the context of emotion processing, a cognitive domain that exhibits continuous development throughout the second decade of life. By targeting both behaviour and brain response, we would also be in an excellent position to define sensible time windows for enhancing plasticity, thereby allowing for targeted intervention approaches that can help improve emotion processing in both typically and atypically developing populations.

Yet, the neural underpinnings of this effect are unknown. We examined the tuning of brain mechanisms for the perception of biological motion to the social relevance of this category of motion by comparing neural response to human and non-human biological motion. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that the response of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) varies according to the social relevance of the motion, responding most strongly to those biological motions with the greatest social relevance (human > dog). During a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session, typical adults viewed veridical point-light displays of human, dog, and tractor motions created from motion capture data. A conjunction analysis identified regions of significant activation during biological motion perception relative to object motion. Within each of these regions, only one brain area, the right pSTS, revealed an enhanced response to human motion relative to dog motion. This finding demonstrates that the pSTS response is sensitive to the social relevance of a biological motion stimulus.

We attempted to dissect cortical activations attributable to verbal WM from those otherwise involved in answering auditory sentence questions. We studied 19 patients who underwent electrocorticography recordings and measured high-gamma activity during auditory naming and WM tasks. In the auditory naming task, inferior-precentral high-gamma activity was augmented during sentence listening, and the magnitude of augmentation was independently correlated to that during the WM task maintenance period as well as patient age. High-gamma augmentation during the WM task scanning period accounted for high-gamma variance during the naming task judgement period in some of the left frontal association neocortex regions (most significantly in the middle-frontal, less in the inferior-frontal, and least in the orbitofrontal gyrus). Inferior-frontal high-gamma augmentation was left-hemispheric dominant during naming task judgement but rather symmetric during WM scanning. Left orbitofrontal high-gamma augmentation was evident only during the naming task judgement period but minimal during the WM task scanning period. The inferior-precentral regions may exert WM maintenance during sentence listening, and such maintenance function may be gradually strengthened as the brain matures. The left frontal association neocortex may have a dorsal-to-ventral gradient in functional roles during naming task judgement. Namely, left middle-frontal activation may be well-attributable to WM scanning function, whereas left orbitofrontal activation may be attributable less to WM scanning but more largely to syntactic/semantic processing. © 2018, The Author(s).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,44,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Results: The geographic and ethnic backgrounds, clinical features, brain imaging studies, muscle imaging studies, and muscle biopsies of children with suspected CMD help predict subtype-specific diagnoses.

There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of various treatment interventions to optimize respiratory, orthopedic, and nutritional outcomes, and more data are needed regarding complications. Recommendations: Multidisciplinary care by experienced teams is important for diagnosing and promoting the health of children with CMD. Accurate assessment of clinical presentations and genetic data will help in identifying the correct subtype-specific diagnosis in many cases.

Objective To refine subtyping of childhood ADHD by using biologically based behavioral dimensions (ie, temperament), novel classification algorithms, and multiple external validators. Design, Setting, and Participants A total of 437 clinicallywell-characterized, community-recruited children, with and without ADHD, participated in an ongoing longitudinal study. Baseline data were used to classify children into subgroups based on temperament dimensions and examine external validators including physiological and magnetic resonance imaging measures. One-year longitudinal follow-up data are reported for a subgroup of the ADHD sample to address stability and clinical prediction. Main Outcomes and Measures Parent/guardian ratings of children on a measure of temperament were used as input features in novel community detection analyses to identify subgroups within the sample. Groups were validated using 3 widely accepted external validators: peripheral physiological characteristics (cardiac measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia and pre-ejection period), central nervous system functioning (via resting-state functional connectivitymagnetic resonance imaging), and clinical outcomes (at 1-year longitudinal follow-up). Results The community detection algorithm suggested 3 novel types of ADHD, labeled as mild (normative emotion regulation), surgent (extreme levels of positive approachmotivation), and irritable (extreme levels of negative emotionality, anger, and poor soothability). Types were independent of existing clinical demarcations including DSM-5 presentations or symptom severity. These types showed stability over time and were distinguished by unique patterns of cardiac physiological response, resting-state functional brain connectivity, and clinical outcomes 1 year later. Conclusions and Relevance Results suggest that a biologically informed temperament-based typology, developed with a discovery-based community detection algorithm, provides a superior description of heterogeneity in the ADHD population than does any current clinical nosologic criteria.

However, the language circuitry continues to undergo significant neuroplastic changes extending well into teenage years. Evidence suggests that the developing brain adheres to two rudimentary principles of functional organization: functional integration and functional specialization.

To evaluate the effect of epilepsy on language functions we investigated the neuroanatomical basis of semantic processing in patients with left (LHE) or right (RHE) hemispheric onset epilepsy using semantic decision fMRI paradigm and group independent component analysis (ICA); we then compared the results of our investigations with language networks in healthy subjects examined with the same language task (Kim K, Karunanayaka P, Privitera M, Holland S, Szaflarski J. Semantic association investigated with fMRI and independent component analysis. In press). Group ICA is a data-driven technique capable of revealing the functional organization of the human brain based on fMRI data. In addition to providing functional connectivity information, ICA can also provide information about the temporal dynamics of underlying networks subserving specific cognitive functions. In this study, we implemented two complementary analyses to investigate group differences in underlying network dynamics based on associated independent component (IC) time courses (a priori defined criterion or a posteriori identified maximum likelihood descriptor). We detected several differences between healthy controls and patients with epilepsy not previously observed with standard fMRI analysis methods. Our analyses confirmed the presence of different effects of LHE or RHE on the behavior of the language network. In particular, a major difference was noted in the nodes subserving verbal encoding and retrieval in the bilateral medial temporal regions. These effects were dependent on the side of the epilepsy onset; that is, effects were different with left or right hemispheric epilepsy. These findings may explain the differences in verbal and nonverbal memory abilities between patients with left and those with right hemispheric epilepsy. Further, although the effects on other nodes of the network were more subtle, several deviations from normal network function were observed in patients with LHE (e.g., alterations in the functions of the primarily left frontotemporal network module) or in patients with RHE (e.g., differences in the medial retrosplenial module responsible for mental imagery or in the anterior cingulate module subserving attention control). These findings not only highlight the negative effects of epilepsy on the main left hemispheric language network nodes in patients with LHE, but also document the effects of epilepsy on other language network nodes whether exerted by LHE or RHE. Further, these results document the advantages of using group ICA for investigating the effects of disease state (e.g., epilepsy) on the network subserving cognitive processing and provide an interesting avenue for further exploration.

Using group independent component analysis (ICA), seven task-related components were identified including the mid-superior temporal gyrus, the most posterior aspect of the superior temporal gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the angular gyrus, and medial aspect of the parietal lobule (precuneus/posterior cingulate). A highly left-lateralized component was found including the medial temporal gyrus, the frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the angular gyrus.

AGC1 is encoded by the SLC25A12 gene. Three patients with pathogenic variants in SLC25A12 have been reported in the literature. These patients were clinically characterized by neurodevelopmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, cerebral atrophy, and hypomyelination; however, there has been discussion in the literature as to whether this hypomyelination is primary or secondary to a neuronal defect. Here we report a 12-year-old patient with variants in SLC25A12 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at multiple ages. Novel compound heterozygous, recessive variants in SLC25A12 were identified: c.1295C'T (p.A432V) and c.1447-2_1447-1delAG. Clinical presentation is characterized by severe intellectual disability, nonambulatory, nonverbal status, hypotonia, epilepsy, spastic quadriplegia, and a happy disposition. The serial neuroimaging findings are notable for cerebral atrophy with white matter involvement, namely, early hypomyelination yet subsequent progression of myelination. The longitudinal MRI findings are most consistent with a leukodystrophy of the leuko-axonopathy category, that is, white matter abnormalities that are most suggestive of mechanisms that result from primary neuronal defects.

The only finding that could be replicated was that autistics have a smaller A/Pcz/300. There was no evidence for abnormal lateralization or abnormal MMN; however, there was an unexpected effect of the task manipulation on the amplitude of the P3: in autistics, the occipital P3 to deviant stimuli was significantly larger in the active than in the passive condition, a finding, like the replication of the smaller A/Pcz/300, specific to the autistic group.

Method: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to contrast brain activity in high functioning ASD (n=17, mean verbal IQ=117) and neurotypical (NT; n=20, mean verbal IQ=112) adolescent and young adult males (12-23. years). Participants responded to three word generation conditions: automatic speech (reciting months), category fluency, and letter fluency. Results: Our paradigm closely mirrored behavioral fluency tasks by requiring overt, free recall word generation while controlling for differences in verbal output between the groups and systematically increasing the task demand. The ASD group showed reduced neural response compared to the NT participants during fluency tasks in multiple regions of left anterior and posterior cortices, and sub-cortical structures. Six of these regions fell in cortico-striatal circuits previously linked to repetitive behaviors (Langen, Durston, Kas, van Engeland, & Staal, 2011), and activity in two of them (putamen and thalamus) was negatively correlated with autism repetitive behavior symptoms in the ASD group. In addition, response in left inferior frontal gyrus was differentially modulated in the ASD, relative to the NT, group as a function of task demand. Conclusions: These data indicate a specific, atypical brain response in ASD to demanding generativity tasks that may have relevance to repetitive behavior symptoms in ASD as well as to difficulties generating original verbal responses. © 2013.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,17,21,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

To this end, we collected functional imaging data from a large sample of subjects (n = 76) with different demographic characteristics such as handedness, sex, and age, while reading. The subject-by-subject error variance was estimated from a one-sample t test (on all 76 subjects) and was reduced to a lower dimension using principal components decomposition. A Gaussian Mixture Model was then applied to dissociate different subgroups of subjects that explained the main sources of variability in the data. This resulted in the identification of four different subject groups. The comparison of these subgroups to the subjects' demographic details showed that age had a significant effect on the subject partitioning. In addition, a region-by-group dissociation in the dorsal and the ventral inferior frontal cortex was consistent with previously reported dissociations in semantic and nonsemantic reading strategies. In contrast to these significant findings, the groupings did not differentiate subjects on the basis of either sex or handedness, nor did they segregate the subjects with right- versus leftlateralized reading activation.

The neurophysiological changes that underlie persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) have not been characterized. Our objective was to compare working-memory related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response in children with persistent symptoms after mTBI at one month post-injury to children with typical recovery and healthy controls. This was a prospective, controlled cohort study of children with mTBI at one month post-injury. PPCS was defined as children with a 10-point increase in their post-concussion symptom inventory score (compared with pre-injury score) at one month post-injury and a two-point increase in at least two symptom categories compared with pre-injury. One hundred and seven participants (60 PPCS, 30 recovered mTBI, and 17 controls) with a mean age of 14.2 years (standard deviation [SD] 2.5) (44% male) were assessed 38 (SD 5.9) days after mTBI. The primary outcome measures were visuospatial n-back working memory task performance and fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal change. Children with PPCS had decreased activation relative to children with typical recovery in the posterior cingulate and precuneus during the one-back working memory condition, despite similar task performance. Differences in cortical activation in children with PPCS at one month highlight the persistent neurobiological consequences of pediatric mTBI on working memory cortical activation.

The secondary objective was to determine the adverse events associated with the MRI procedure. Methods: In this single center, prospective, observational study. Children (2 mo - 12 y) presenting with impaired consciousness were screened. Those with acute non-traumatic encephalopathy (Glasgow Coma Score of 12 or less) undergoing their first in-patient MRI brain were included. The decision regarding MRI brain was taken by the treating unit. The clinician taking care of the child was requested to categorize the information obtained from MRI into one of the following categories (as per definition): Contributory MRI [Diagnostic and/or Therapeutic, Suggestive or Additive and/or Prognostic (as per definitions)] OR Non-contributory MRI (If results of the MRI did not alter the management of the child in any manner). Results: During the study period, 16,667 children presented to the pediatric emergency, of which 496 children were admitted with a diagnosis of acute encephalopathy and100 children were enrolled for this study. Ninety-two children had a febrile encephalopathy. Seventy-seven (77%, 95% CI 69–85%) children had an MRI that was contributory. In 64(78%) out of 82 children who underwent both CT and MRI, the MRI showed additional findings. Those with abnormal CT were significantly more likely to have a contributory MRI (65.6% vs. 22.2%, P = 0.001). There were 18 adverse events during the MRI procedure. Conclusions: MRI contributes in management decisions in over three-fourth of children presenting with non-traumatic coma and should be the neuroimaging of choice in acute non-traumatic coma. There are no pre-MRI clues to identify which child is likely to benefit from the MRI. However, if CT detects an abnormality, MRI is likely to significantly add to the information, contributing directly to the management. © 2017, Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,0.1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Furthermore, research to date has not examined PT size in ADHD even though the right inferior frontal region has been implicated in the disorder. Hence, one of the purposes of this study was to examine the structure of the PT in dyslexia and ADHD. The other purposes included examining the PT in relation to overall expressive language ability and in relation to several specific linguistic functions given language functioning often is affected in both dyslexia and ADHD. Participants included 50 children: 10 with dyslexia, 15 with comorbid dyslexia/ADHD, 15 with ADHD, and 10 controls. Using a 2 (dyslexia or not) × 2 (ADHD or not) MANCOVA, findings revealed PT length and shape were comparable between those with and without dyslexia. However, children with ADHD had smaller right PT lengths than those without ADHD, and right anterior ascending ramus length was related to attention problems in the total sample. In terms of linguistic functioning, presence of an extra sulcus in the left PT was related to poor expressive language ability. In those with adequate expressive language functioning, left PT length was related to phonological awareness, phonological short-term memory and rapid automatic naming (RAN). Right PT length was related to RAN and semantic processing. Further work on PT morphology in relation to ADHD and linguistic functioning is warranted. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Neuroimaging studies have revealed localization and lateralization of semantic circuitry, making substantial contributions to cognitive neuroscience. However, because of methodological limitations, these investigations have only identified individual functional components rather than capturing the behavior of the entire network. To overcome these limitations, we have implemented group independent component analysis (ICA) to investigate the cognitive modules used by healthy adults performing the fMRI semantic decision task. When compared with the results of a standard general linear modeling (GLM) analysis, ICA detected several additional brain regions subserving semantic decision. Eight task-related group ICA maps were identified, including left inferior frontal gyrus (BA44/45), middle posterior temporal gyrus (BA39/22), angular gyrus/ inferior parietal lobule (BA39/40), posterior cingulate (BA30), bilateral lingual gyrus (BA18/23), inferior frontal gyrus (L > R, BA47), hippocampus with parahippocampal gyrus (L > R, BA35/36), and anterior cingulate (BA32/24). Although most of the components were represented bilaterally, we found a single, highly left-lateralized component that included the inferior frontal gyrus and the medial and superior temporal gyri, the angular and supramarginal gyri, and the inferior parietal cortex. The presence of these spatially independent ICA components implies functional connectivity and can be equated with their modularity.

We applied fMRI before and after a one-year sports therapy in 14 obese or overweight children aged 7-16 years. During scanning, participants observed a set of standardized pictures from food categories, sports, and pleasant and neutral images. We were interested in alterations of the cerebral activation to food images in association with changes in the BMI-standard deviation score (BMI-SDS) after therapy and therefore separated the observation group into two outcome subgroups. One with reduction of BMI-SDS >0.2 (responder group) and one without (non-responder group). Before therapy fMRI-activation between groups did not differ. After therapy we found the following results: in response to food images, obese children of the responder group showed increased activation in the left putamen when compared with the non-responder group. Pleasant images evoked increased insula activation in the responder group. Only the responder group showed enhanced activity within areas known to store trained motor patterns in response to sports images. Both the putamen and the insula are involved in the processing of emotional valence and were only active for the therapy responders during the observation of food or pleasant stimuli. Elevated activity in these regions might possibly be seen in the context of an increase of dopaminergic response to emotional positive stimuli during intervention. In addition, sport images activated motor representations only in those subjects who profited from the sports therapy. Overall, an altered response to rewarding and pleasant images and an increased recruitment of motor engrams during observations of sports pictures indicates a more normal cerebral processing in response to these stimuli after successful sports therapy in obese children. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,13.15,15,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Nevertheless, FS are often associated with hippocampal sclerosis which can imply episodic memory deficits. This interrelation has hardly been studied so far. In the current study 13 children who had suffered from FS during infancy and 14 control children (7-9 years old) were examined for episodic and semantic memory with standardized neuropsychological tests. Furthermore, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we studied neuronal activation while the children performed a continuous recognition memory task. The analysis of the behavioral data of the neuropsychological tests and the recognition memory experiment did not reveal any between group differences in memory performance. Consistent with other studies fMRI revealed repetition enhancement effects for both groups in a variety of brain regions (e.g. right middle frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus) and a repetition suppression effect in the right superior temporal gyrus. Different neural activation patterns between both groups were obtained selectively within the right supramarginal gyrus (BA 40). In the control group correct rejections of new items (CRs) were associated with stronger activation than correctly identified old items (HITs) whereas in the FS group no difference occurred. On the background that the right supramarginal gyrus is assumed to mediate a top-down process to internally direct attention towards recollected information, the results could indicate that control children used strategic recollection in order to reject new items (recall-to-reject). In contrast, the missing effect in the FS group could reflect a lack of strategy use, possibly due to impaired recollective processing. This study demonstrates that FS, even with mainly benign courses, can be accompanied by selective modifications in the neural structures underlying recognition memory. © 2012 Kipp, Opitz, Becker, Hofmann, Krick, Gortner and Mecklinger.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,8,9,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Pediatric irritability and anxiety symptoms are prevalent and frequently co-occur. Threat orienting is pertinent to both phenotypes and is an ideal context in which to examine their unique and common neural mechanisms. OBJECTIVES To decompose the unique and shared variances of pediatric irritability and anxiety symptoms and to determine neural correlates of these differentiated phenotypes during threat orienting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation was a cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging study. The setting was a research clinic at the National Institute of Mental Health. Participants were youth aged 8 to 18 years spanning multiple diagnostic categories (141 youth with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, anxiety disorder, and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and 56 healthy youth). This combination provided wide variation in levels of irritability and anxiety symptoms. Data were acquired between June 30, 2012, and June 28, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Participants and parents rated youth’s irritability on the Affective Reactivity Index and anxiety on the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders. Bifactor analysis decomposed the unique and shared variances. A functional magnetic resonance imaging dot-probe task assessed attention orienting to angry (ie, threat) vs neutral faces. Whole-brain analyses examined associations between the bifactor-derived phenotypes and both neural activity and amygdala functional connectivity. RESULTS Among 197 participants included in the final analysis, the mean (SD) age was 13.1 (2.7) years, and 91 (46.2%) were female. The best-fit bifactor model (Comparative Fit Index, 0.959; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation, 0.066) included unique factors of parent-reported irritability, youth-reported irritability, and anxiety, as well as a common factor of negative affectivity. When the task required attention away from threat, higher parent-reported irritability was associated with increased activity in the insula, caudate, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and inferior parietal lobule (t 189 4.15 for all, P &lt; .001 for all). In contrast, higher anxiety was associated with decreased amygdala connectivity to the cingulate, thalamus, and precentral gyrus (t 189 −4.19 for all, P &lt; .001 for all). These distinctive neural correlates did not emerge using a diagnostic approach. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A latent variable approach to parsing co-occurring symptom dimensions revealed a novel double dissociation. During orientation away from threat, only irritability was associated with neural activity, whereas only anxiety was associated with amygdala connectivity. Despite the challenges of symptom co-occurrence for clinical neuroscience, data-driven phenotyping may facilitate a path forward. © 2018 American Medical Association.

However, little is known about the neural correlates of gestures accompanying speech comprehension. The goal of this study is to investigate the neural basis of speech–gesture interaction as reflected in activation increase and decrease during observation of natural communication. Fourteen German participants watched video clips of 5 s duration depicting an actor who performed metaphoric gestures to illustrate the abstract content of spoken sentences. Furthermore, video clips of isolated gestures (without speech), isolated spoken sentences (without gestures) and gestures in the context of an unknown language (Russian)were additionally presented while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired. Bimodal speech and gesture processing led to left hemispheric activation increases of the posterior middle temporal gyrus, the premotor cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the right superior temporal sulcus. Activation reductions during the bimodal condition were located in the left superior temporal gyrus and the left posterior insula. Gesture related activation increases and decreases were dependent on language semantics and were not found in the unknown-language condition. Our results suggest that semantic integration processes for bimodal speech plus gesture comprehension are reflected in activation increases in the classical left hemispheric language areas. Speech related gestures seem to enhance language comprehension during the face-to-face communication.

Children from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds perform below children from higher SES backgrounds on tests of intelligence and academic achievement, and recent findings indicate that low SES (LSES) children are impaired on behavioral measures of prefrontal function. However, the influence of socioeconomic disparity on direct measures of neural activity is unknown. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence indicating that prefrontal function is altered in LSES children. We found that prefrontal-dependent electrophysiological measures of attention were reduced in LSES compared to high SES (HSES) children in a pattern similar to that observed in patients with lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) damage. These findings provide neurophysiological evidence that social inequalities are associated with alterations in PFC function in LSES children. There are a number of factors associated with LSES rearing conditions that may have contributed to these results such as greater levels of stress and lack of access to cognitively stimulating materials and experiences. Targeting specific prefrontal processes affected by socioeconomic disparity could be helpful in developing intervention programs for LSES children. © 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,9.5,12,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Whether and how prematurity alters neural specialization within visual neural networks is still unknown. We used functional and structural brain imaging to examine the visual semantic system of VLBW born (< 1250 g, gestational age 25–32 weeks) adolescents (13–15 years, n = 11, 3 males) and matched term born control participants (13–15 years, n = 11, 3 males). Neurocognitive assessment revealed no group differences except for lower scores on an adaptive visuomotor integration test. All adolescents were scanned while viewing pictures of animals and tools and scrambled versions of these pictures. Both groups demonstrated animal and tool category related neural networks. Term born adolescents showed tool category related neural activity, i.e. tool pictures elicited more activity than animal pictures, in temporal and parietal brain areas. Animal category related activity was found in the occipital, temporal and frontal cortex. VLBW born adolescents showed reduced tool category related activity in the dorsal visual stream compared with controls, specifically the left anterior intraparietal sulcus, and enhanced animal category related activity in the left middle occipital gyrus and right lingual gyrus. Lower birth weight of VLBW adolescents correlated with larger thickness of the pericalcarine gyrus in the occipital cortex and smaller surface area of the superior temporal gyrus in the lateral temporal cortex. Moreover, larger thickness of the pericalcarine gyrus and smaller surface area of the superior temporal gyrus correlated with reduced tool category related activity in the parietal cortex. Together, our data suggest that very low birth weight predicts alterations of higher order visual semantic networks, particularly in the dorsal stream. The differences in neural specialization may be associated with aberrant cortical development of areas in the visual system that develop early in childhood.

We examined within- and across-language adaptation for spoken words in English-French bilinguals who had acquired their L2 after the age of 4 years. Subjects listened to words presented binaurally through earphones. In two control conditions (one for each language), six identical words were presented to obtain maximal adaptation. The remaining six conditions each consisted of five words that were identical followed by a sixth word that differed. There were thus a total of eight experimental conditions: no-change (sixth word identical to first five); a change in meaning (different final word in L1); a change in language (final item translated into L2); a change in meaning and language (different final word in L2). The same four conditions were presented in L2. The study also included a silent baseline. At the neural level, within- and across-language word changes resulted in release from adaptation. This was true for separate analyses of L1 and L2. We saw no evidence for greater recovery from adaptation in across-language relative to within-language conditions. While many brain regions were common to L1 and L2, we did observe differences in adaptation for forward translation (L1 to L2) as compared to backward translation (L2 to L1).

One hundred six children and adults (AI positive∈=∈77, AI∈+∈PCR positive = 3, PCR positive∈=∈26) were identified, most with reactivated infections. Twenty-eight showed typical EBV-related diseases (encephalitis, neuritis, meningitis), 19 further infections (HSV encephalitis, neuroborreliosis, HIV infection, bacterial meningitis), nine immune-mediated disorders (multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis), and 50 further diseases not typical for EBV.

The seminal article on XH, a condition typified by foamy histiocytes and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in the pituitary gland/sellar region, but usually little or no hemosiderin pigment, detailed three patients. However, most reports since that time have been single cases, making understanding of the entity difficult. In contrast, the seminal report on XG, characterized by sellar region cholesterol clefts, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, marked hemosiderin deposits, fibrosis, multinucleated giant cells around cholesterol clefts, eosinophilic granular necrotic debris, and accumulation of macrophages, included 37 patients, allowing more insights into etiology. Few examples could be linked to adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma, and although ciliated epithelium similar to that of Rathke cleft cyst (RCC) was identified up to 35% of the 37 cases, it could not be proven that XG was related to hemorrhage into RCC. Case reports since that time, however, occasionally linked XG to RCC when an etiology could be identified at all, and a few recognized that a spectrum exists in xanthomatous lesions of the sella. They review literature, adding 23 cases from our own experience, to confirm that overlap occurs between XH and XG, and that the majority—but not all—can be linked to RCC leakage/rupture/hemorrhage.

There were no differences in task accuracy or reaction time. At the group level, both groups had activation in left language areas; controls, but not ASD, also had activation in the left pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). In ASD, less left frontal activation and reduced left lateralization of activation within these regions was associated with shorter reaction times and better language skills. More left temporal activation was associated with better language abilities in ASD. Differences in pre-SMA activation may relate to motor planning deficits or differences in approach to the semantic task in ASD.

In the present experiment, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral measures were used to investigate the acquisition of case-marking cues for sentence interpretation in the developing brain of German preschool children with a mean age of 6. years. Short sentences were presented auditorily, consisting of a transitive verb and two case-marked arguments with canonical subject-initial or non canonical object-initial word order. Overall group results revealed mainly left hemispheric activation in the perisylvian cortex with increased activation in the inferior parietal cortex (IPC), and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for object-initial compared to subject-initial sentences. However, single-subject analysis suggested two distinct activation patterns within the group which allowed a classification into two subgroups. One subgroup showed the predicted activation increase in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) for the more difficult object-initial compared to subject-initial sentences, while the other group showed the reverse effect. This activation in the left IFG can be taken to reflect the degree to which adult-like sentence processing strategies, necessary to integrate case-marking information, are applied. Additional behavioral data on language development tests show that these two subgroups differ in their grammatical knowledge. Together with these behavioral findings, the results indicate that the use of a particular processing strategy is not dependent on age as such, but rather on the child's individual grammatical knowledge and the ability to use specific language cues for successful sentence comprehension. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,5.75,6,NaN,auditory subject-/object-initial sentences vs. baseline,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Relative to controls, the patients displayed a diminished activation of the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) when processing anger prosody, which was correlated with aggressive behavior. There were no group differences for the other emotions. Additionally, the ADHD group showed increased supramarginal gyrus (SMG) activation in the anger condition. This might mirror compensatory attention allocation. In summary, we identified a selectively lowered STG activation to auditory anger cues in ADHD patients.

Methods: We studied 41 patients with focal epilepsy who underwent measurement of naming-related gamma-augmentation at 50-120. Hz during extraoperative electrocorticography. The assigned task consisted of naming of a visually-presented object classified as either 'animal' or 'non-animal'. Results: Within 80. ms following the onset of picture presentation, regardless of stimulus type, gamma-activity in bilateral occipital regions began to be augmented compared to the resting period. Initially in the occipital poles (at 140. ms and after) and subsequently in the lateral, inferior and medial occipital regions (at 320. ms and after), the degree of gamma-augmentation elicited by 'animal naming' became larger (by up to 52%) than that by 'non-animal naming'. Immediately prior to the overt response, left inferior frontal gamma-augmentation became modestly larger during 'animal naming' compared to 'non-animal naming'. Conclusions: Animal category-preferential gamma-augmentation sequentially involved the lower- and higher-order visual areas. Relatively larger occipital gamma-augmentation during 'animal naming' can be attributed to the more attentive analysis of animal stimuli including the face. Animal-preferential gamma-augmentation in the left inferior frontal region could be attributed to a need for selective semantic retrieval during 'animal naming'.

Ten patients diagnosed with COMA (M:F = 4:6, 4-37 years old) were reviewed. Four individuals who gained the ability to walk at 2 years or earlier showed normal intellect and social skills. Those who walked later often showed accompanying intellectual (5/6) and speech (6/6) disabilities. In this latter group, atypical oculomotor signs for COMA (presence of nystagmus, mild limitation of vertical gaze, slower head thrust, and marked improvement of lateral saccade during early childhood) were often noted (4/6). Minor anomalies of fingers and toes were also common in this group. Neuroimaging was conduced in nine patients (pneumoencepharography 1; computed tomography: 8, magnetic resonance imaging: 2). Dilatation of the fourth ventricle, mainly at the level of the midbrain or upper pons (n = 7), and hypoplastic cerebellar vermis (n = 6) were commonly observed in both the early- and late-walking groups.

Methods Children diagnosed with arterial ischemic stroke more than two years previously and typically developing controls were included. Executive function (EF) measures comprised inhibition (Go-NoGo task), fluency (category fluency task), processing speed (processing speed tasks), divided attention, working memory (letter-number sequencing), conceptual reasoning (matrices) and EF in everyday life (questionnaire). High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) structural images and resting-state functional MR imaging were acquired. Independent component analysis was used to identify the frontoparietal network. Functional connections were obtained through correlation matrices; associations between cognitive measures and functional connections through Pearson's correlations. Results Twenty participants after stroke (7 females; mean age 16.0 years) and 22 controls (13 females; mean age 14.8 years) were examined. Patients and controls performed within the normal range in all executive tasks. Patients who had had a stroke performed significantly less well in tests of fluency, processing speed and conceptual reasoning than controls. Resting-state functional connectivity between the left and right inferior parietal lobe was significantly reduced in patients after pediatric stroke. Fluency, processing speed and perceptual reasoning correlated positively with the interhemispheric inferior parietal lobe connection in patients and controls. Conclusion Decreased interhemispheric connections after stroke in childhood may indicate a disruption of typical interhemispheric interactions relating to executive functions.

There has been a significant progress made in the understanding of etiology of parasomnias based on the results of neurophysiological, genetic, and neuroimaging studies. The existing International Classification of Sleep Disorders divides parasomnias into several categories including: disorders of arousal, parasomnias associated with REM sleep, and other parasomnias. Prevalence of parasomnias varies across clinical samples with higher prevalence being reported among patients with medical/neurological and psychiatric disorders and among children of younger ages.

"Kovelman, Ioulia",2006,databases,Bilingual and monolingual brains compared: A fMRI study of semantic processing,NaN,NaN,"Does early and sustained experience with two languages in childhood modify how language is processed in the adult bilingual brain? Does extensive exposure to two languages influence language processing in the bilingual brain as compared to monolinguals? The present study investigated how adult bilinguals process semantic information, both in speech and in print, across varying language contexts or modes (bilingual modes and monolingual modes). Using behavioral and neuroimaging (fMRI) measurements, two hypotheses were tested, the Neurological Signature Hypothesis and the Functional Switching Hypothesis. The Neurological Signature Hypothesis predicts that early highly proficient bilinguals will recruit neurological tissue to process language differently from monolinguals; hence, such differences may constitute a 'neurological signature' of bilingualism and should be present across all language contexts. The Functional Switching Hypothesis predicts that bilinguals will recruit neurological tissue to process language similarly to monolinguals, but not across all contexts/modes. Early-exposed highly proficient Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals (N=27) completed a Semantic Judgment (lexico-semantic level), a Passage Comprehension (sentences) and a non-linguistic Stimulus-Response Compatibility attention task in the fMRI scanner. During the Semantic Judgment task bilinguals were presented with words in Spanish and in English, one language at a time (monolingual mode), and in rapid alternation (bilingual mode). Monolinguals completed each language task in English only. Our results supported the Neurological Signature Hypothesis. When presented with one language at a time, bilinguals demonstrated greater recruitment of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) than monolinguals. When presented with two languages in rapid alternation, bilinguals demonstrated a more robust recruitment of right DLPFC and right inferior frontal cortex. During non-linguistic attentional tasks bilinguals showed higher behavioral accuracy during control and incongruous trials, but not during switch trials, as compared to monolinguals, and bilinguals also had an overall more robust recruitment of the left inferior parietal cortex. These findings elucidate how extensive early bilingual exposure modifies language organization in the brain, as well as how this change impacts other domains of cognition. This research further identifies the benefits of early and extensive bilingual education, including high dual language proficiency, skilled dual language literacy, and enhancement of general cognitive capabilities.

ADHD patients and healthy controls both showed a more negative slow-wave in response to task cues signalling semantic as compared to perceptual stimulus processing. In contrast to ADHD patients, healthy control children showed a larger increase in memory performance for deeply processed neutral pictures which was accompanied by a more positive mid-latency ERP component (so-called P300) after stimulus onset. Our results demonstrate that ADHD patients succeeded in allocating neural resources in preparation of different task demands. However, this increase in preparatory activation to the semantic task cue did not suffice to support successful processing and encoding of neutral stimuli to the same extent as in healthy controls. These findings provide evidence that ADHD patients show deficits in translating pre-stimulus mobilization of neural resources to successful memory formation in the absence of salient stimulus material. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, previous studies have made little effort to specifically probe orthographic processing while minimizing the need for higher-order reading related operations, especially phonological processing. Phonological deficits are well documented in dyslexia but may limit interpretations of ventral occipitotemporal underactivation as a primarily orthographic coding deficit, considering that different processing modes occur highly parallel. We therefore used a task that restricts higher-order processing to better isolate orthographic deficits. Thirteen dyslexic adolescents and twenty-two matched typical readers performed a low-level target detection task combined with rapidly presented stimuli of increasing similarity to real words during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The clear deviance found in impaired readers' left ventral occipitotemporal organization suggested deficits in print sensitivity at bottom-up processing stages that are largely independent of phonological operations.

Clinical, biologic, and radiographic delineation of the various monophasic and chronic childhood demyelinating disorders requires an operational classification system to facilitate prospective research studies. METHODS: The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) organized an International Pediatric MS Study Group (Study Group) composed of adult and pediatric neurologists and experts in genetics, epidemiology, neuropsychology, nursing, and immunology. The group met several times to develop consensus definitions regarding the major CNS inflammatory demyelinating disorders of children and adolescents. RESULTS: Clinical definitions are proposed for pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), recurrent ADEM, multiphasic ADEM, neuromyelitis optica, and clinically isolated syndrome. These definitions are considered operational and need to be tested in future research and modified accordingly. CONCLUSION: CNS inflammatory demyelinating disorders presenting in children and adolescents can be defined and distinguished.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2008-04007-001[/rid].) Terrorists are attacking scientists who are attempting to alleviate human suffering. We need a concerted public effort to eliminate these acts, particularly the harassment of scientists studying nonhuman primates. This need is highlighted by the attacks upon the home of our friend and colleague, the noted medical scientist, Dr. Edy, the London, professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences and of molecular and medical pharmacology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). Her work exemplifies the unique role of research involving nonhuman primates in enabling the results of research in simple systems and lower organisms to be applied to human diseases. Dr. London suffered two attacks upon her home within 4 months that have escalated in their level of threat to her life and work. The first attack involved flooding of her home, the second attach involved setting fire to her home. These crimes mirror other recent attacks on scientists conducting medical research involving animals, only a few of which we will mention here. It is impossible to reconcile the willingness of these terrorists to harm humans, particularly people who are working to alleviate human suffering, with their contention that they value life of all kinds. Scientists, like Dr. London, care about the primates that they study. These terrorist acts might intimidate people and institutions that would otherwise speak out in support of nonhuman primate research and against terrorism. By failing to take public action, we contribute to the isolation of the scientists involved and the institutions in which they work. We seek a more vigorous investigation and prosecution of the criminals committing the crimes against these scientists, their staffs, their families, their neighbors, and the communities in which they live. Lastly, we wish to laud the dedication and courage shown by Dr. London and those like her that continue to strive to reduce suffering and advance science despite obvious personal cost. As the beneficiaries of progress in medical care, it is also our responsibility to join the struggle to preserve medical research.

It has been suggested that the VWFA arises through competition between pre-existing selectivity for other stimulus categories, changing the topography of VOTC to support rapid word recognition. Here, we hypothesized that competition between words and objects would be resolved as children acquire reading skill. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined the relationship between responses to words and objects in VOTC in two ways. First, we defined the VWFA using a words > objects contrast and found that only skilled readers had a region that responded more to words than objects. Second, we defined the VWFA using a words > faces contrast and examined selectivity for words over objects in this region. We found that word selectivity strongly correlated with reading skill, suggesting reading skill-dependent tuning for words. Furthermore, we found that low word selectivity in struggling readers was not due to a lack of response to words, but to a high response to objects. Our results suggest that the fine-tuning of word-selective responses in VOTC is a critical component of skilled reading. © 2018 The Authors",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,exclude,9.94,12,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Fifty-four anxious alcohol-dependent participants were admitted to an inpatient unit at the NIH Clinical Center, completed withdrawal treatment, and were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with pexacerfont (300 mg/day for 7 days, followed by 100 mg/day for 23 days). After reaching steady state, participants were assessed for alcohol craving in response to stressful or alcohol-related cues, neuroendocrine responses to these stimuli, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to alcohol-related stimuli or stimuli with positive or negative emotional valence. A separate group of 10 patients received open-label pexacerfont following the same dosing regimen and had cerebrospinal fluid sampled to estimate central nervous system exposure. Pexacerfont treatment had no effect on alcohol craving, emotional responses, or anxiety. There was no effect of pexacerfont on neural responses to alcohol-related or affective stimuli. These results were obtained despite drug levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that predict close to 90% central CRH1 receptor occupancy. CRH1 antagonists have been grouped based on their receptor dissociation kinetics, with pexacerfont falling in a category characterized by fast dissociation. Our results may indicate that antagonists with slow offset are required for therapeutic efficacy. Alternatively, the extensive preclinical data on CRH1 antagonism as a mechanism to suppress alcohol seeking may not translate to humans.

Fifteen patients with gait dysfunction (bilateral trunk instability) were included in the group A, and the other 15 patients with gait dysfunction (unilateral trunk instability) were included in the group B. The Growth Motor Function Classification System, Functional Ambulation Category scale, and Functional Ambulation Category scale were used for measurement of functional state. Fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, fiber number, and tract integrity of the CRT and corticospinal tract were measured. Diffusion parameters or integrity of corticospinal tract were not significantly different in the three study groups. However, CRT results revealed that both CRTs were disrupted in the group A, whereas CRT disruption in the hemispheres contralateral to clinical manifestations was observed in the group B. Fractional anisotropy values and fiber numbers in both CRTs were decreased in the group A than in the group TD. The extents of decreases of fractional anisotropy values and fiber numbers on the ipsilateral side relative to those on the contralateral side were greater in the group B than in the group TD.

The children performed two tasks in which they had to discriminate whether images of faces presented sequentially in pairs were identical. The images showed four different categories of gaze: direct gaze, eyes averted (left or right) and closed eyes but there was no instruction to focus on the direction of gaze. Images of motorbikes were used as control stimuli. Faces evoked strong activity over posterior brain regions at about 100 ms in both groups of children. A response at 140 ms to faces observed over extrastriate cortices, thought to be homologous to the N170 in adults, was weak and bilateral in both groups and somewhat weaker (approaching significance) in the children with autism than in the control children. The response to motorbikes differed between the groups at 100 and 140 ms. Averted eyes evoked a strong right lateralized component at 240 ms in the normally developing children that was weak in the clinical group. By contrast, direct gaze evoked a left lateralized component at 240 ms only in children with autism. The findings suggest that face and gaze processing in children with autism follows a trajectory somewhat similar to that seen in normal development but with subtle differences.

If reading acquisition is challenging in one language, how is it when reading is acquired simultaneously in two languages? What is the impact of bilingualism on the development of literacy? We review behavioral and neuroimaging evidence from alphabetic writing systems suggesting that early bilingualism modulates reading development. Particularly, we show that cross-linguistic variations and cross-linguistic transfer affect bilingual reading strategies as well as their cognitive underpinnings. We stress the fact that the impact of bilingualism on literacy acquisition depends on the specific combination of languages learned and does not manifest itself similarly across bilingual populations. We argue that these differences can be explained by variations due to orthographic depth in the grain sizes used to perform reading and reading-related tasks. Overall, we propose novel hypotheses to shed light on the behavioral and neural variability observed in reading skills among bilinguals. © 2017, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We found reduced activation for RD relative to NI in a number of left-hemisphere reading-related areas across all processing tasks regardless of task type (semantic vs. phonological) or modality (auditory vs. visual modality). Moreover, activation differences in these regions, which included the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus, and the occipitotemporal region, were largely independent of in-scanner performance in our auditory semantic task. That is, although RD participants and NI participants differed in performance in visually presented conditions, they did not differ significantly in the auditory condition, yet similar patterns of reduced activation were observed in these regions across conditions.

These studies mainly focused on reading sub-skills, and it remains debated whether such dysfunction is apparent during more ecologically valid reading skills, such as reading fluency. In this fMRI study, reading fluency was systematically varied to characterize neural correlates of reading fluency in 30 children with (RD) and without (typical developing children, TYP) a RD. Sentences were presented at constrained, comfortable, and accelerated speeds, which were determined based on individual reading speed. Behaviorally, RD children displayed decreased performance in several reading-related tasks. Using fMRI, we demonstrated that both TYP and RD children display increased activation in several components of the reading network during fluent reading. When required to read at an accelerated speed, RD children exhibited less activation in the fusiform gyrus (FG) compared with the TYP children. A region of interest analysis substantiated differences in the FG and demonstrated a relationship to behavioral reading performance. These results suggest that the FG plays a key role in fluent reading and that it can be modulated by speed.

The main objective of study was to determine the type and frequency of stroke risk factors in patients with first-in-life stroke before the age of 50. Methods Our study included patients under the age of 50 with first-in-life stroke. The following data obtained from all participants were analyzed: a neuroimaging of the head, wide panel of blood tests, electrocardiogram, transesophageal echocardiography, ultrasound of the carotid/cerebral arteries. 24-hour ECG monitoring and angio-MRI of head were performed in most patients. Results One hundred and eighty-four patients were qualified into the study; mean age–39 years (female 45%). The female gender was significantly more often associated with diabetes, carotid/cerebral artery stenosis, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy and risk factors associated with lifestyle. More than half of the patients presented at least two risk stroke factors. The most frequent categories of risk factors were related to arteries and metabolic diseases. Vascular risk factors were among the most frequent in individual age categories. Hereditary stroke-burden was significant in the patient before the age of 20.15% of the patients haven’t got known stroke risk factor. Conclusions Angiopathy is the most common risk factor for stroke at a young age. More than half of the patients with stroke at a young age have at least two independent risk factors for stroke. In the first two decades of life, the most frequent risk factors for stroke are heart diseases; arterial diseases play a dominant role in the consecutive three decades. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,39,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Whereas adults clearly demarcate safe situations from real dangers, attenuating fear to the former but not the latter, adolescents' immaturity in prefrontal cortex function may limit their ability to form clear-cut threat categories, allowing pervasive fears to manifest. Here we developed a discrimination learning paradigm that assesses the ability to categorize threat from safety cues to test these hypotheses on age differences in neurodevelopment. In experiment 1, we first demonstrated the capacity of this paradigm to generate threat/safety discrimination learning in both adolescents and adults. Next, in experiment 2, we used this paradigm to compare the behavioral and neural correlates of threat/safety discrimination learning in adolescents and adults using functional MRI. This second experiment yielded three sets of findings. First, when labeling threats online, adolescents reported less discrimination between threat and safety cues than adults. Second, adolescents were more likely than adults to engage early-maturing subcortical structures during threat/safety discrimination learning. Third, adults' but not adolescents' engagement of late-maturing prefrontal cortex regions correlated positively with fear ratings during threat/safety discrimination learning. These data are consistent with the role of dorsolateral regions during category learning, particularly when differences between stimuli are subtle [Miller EK, Cohen JD (2001) Annu Rev Neurosci 24:167-202].

METHODS: Thirty-five patients with histologically diagnosed LGGs (21 low-grade astrocytomas and 14 low-grade oligodendrogliomas and low-grade mixed oligoastrocytomas) were studied with dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion magnetic resonance imaging. Wilcoxon tests were used to compare patients in different response categories (complete response, stable, progressive, death) with respect to baseline rCBV. Log-rank tests were used to evaluate the association of rCBV with survival and time to progression. Kaplan-Meier time-to-progression curves were generated. Tumor volumes and CBV measurements were obtained at the initial examination and again at follow-up to determine the association of rCBV with tumor volume progression. RESULTS: Wilcoxon tests showed patients manifesting an adverse event (either death or progression) had significantly higher rCBV (P = 0.003) than did patients without adverse events (complete response or stable disease). Log-rank tests showed that rCBV exhibited a significant negative association with disease-free survival (P = 0.0015), such that low rCBV values were associated with longer time to progression. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that lesions with rCBV less than 1.75 (n = 16) had a median time to progression of 4620 ± 433 days, and lesions with rCBV more than 1.75 (n = 19) had a median time to progression of 245 ± 62 days (P < 0.005). Lesions with low baseline rCBV (<1.75) demonstrated stable tumor volumes when followed up over time, and lesions with high baseline rCBV (>1.75) demonstrated progressively increasing tumor volumes over time. CONCLUSION: Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion magnetic resonance imaging may be used to identify LGGs that are either high-grade gliomas, misdiagnosed because of sampling error at pathological examination or that have undergone angiogenesis in the progression toward malignant transformation. This suggests that rCBV measurements may be used as a second reference standard to determine the surgical management/risk - benefit equation and postsurgical adjuvant therapy for LGGs.

Our goal was to identify how preoperative sensorimotor functional studies were used to guide the treatment of neuro-oncologic and epilepsy surgery patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 46 patients who had undergone preoperative sensorimotor functional MR imaging to document how often and in what ways the imaging studies had influenced their management. Clinical management decisions were grouped into three categories: for assessing the feasibility of surgical resection, for surgical planning, and for selecting patients for invasive functional mapping procedures. RESULTS: Functional MR imaging studies successfully identified the functional central sulcus ipsilateral to the abnormality in 32 of the 46 patients, and these 32 patients are the focus of this report. In epilepsy surgery candidates, the functional MR imaging results were used to determine in part the feasibility of a proposed surgical resection in 70% of patients, to aid in surgical planning in 43%, and to select patients for invasive surgical functional mapping in 52%. In tumor patients, the functional MR imaging results were used to determine in part the feasibility of surgical resection in 55%, to aid in surgical planning in 22%, and to select patients for invasive surgical functional mapping in 78%. Overall, functional MR imaging studies were used in one or more of the three clinical decision- making categories in 89% of tumor patients and 91% of epilepsy surgery patients.

However, little is known about the structural correlates of this network within the context of typical development and whether anatomical coupling in linguistically relevant regions of cortex varies as a function of vocabulary skill. Here we investigate the association between vocabulary and anatomical coupling in 235 typically developing youth (ages 6-19 years) using structural MRI. The study's primary aim was to evaluate whether higher vocabulary performance was associated with greater vertex-level cortical thickness covariation in distributed regions of cortex known to be associated with word knowledge. Results indicate that better vocabulary skills are associated with greater anatomical coupling in several linguistically relevant regions of cortex, including the left inferior parietal (temporal-parietal junction), inferior temporal, middle frontal, and superior frontal gyri and the right inferior frontal and precentral gyri. Furthermore, in high vocabulary scorers, stronger coupling is found among these regions. Thus, complementing patient and fMRI studies, this is the first investigation to highlight the relevance of anatomical covariance within the cortex to vocabulary skills in typically developing youth, further elucidating the distributed nature of neural systems subserving word knowledge. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,11.65,19,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Methods This study included 112 newly diagnosed epileptic patients treated with LTG [69 males and 43 females aged 9.6±2.7 years (mean±SD)]. Repeated neurologic examinations, electroencephalography, neuroimaging studies, and standard language tests including the Test of Problem Solving (TOPS), mean length of utterance in words (MLU-w), Receptive and Expressive Vocabulary Test (REVT), and Urimal Test of Articulation and Phonology were performed before and after initiating LTG treatment. The starting LTG dosage was 1 mg/kg/day (maximum: 25 mg/day) for the first 14 days, which was increased to 2 mg/kg/day for the subsequent 14 days and then up to 7 mg/kg/day (or 200 mg/day) for maintenance. Results Problem-solving skills as assessed by TOPS scores significantly improved after initiating LTG treatment (33.5±14.5 vs. 35.7±14.25, p<0.01).

Neuroimaging findings and comorbidities data were extracted from the Quebec Cerebral Palsy Registry for children born in a 4-year birth interval (1999-2002) covering half of the province's population. Neuroimaging studies were classified into 10 mutually exclusive categories (periventricular white matter injury/leukomalacia, cerebral malformation, cerebral vascular accident, deep gray matter injury, superficial gray matter injury, diffuse gray matter injury, intracranial hemorrhage, infection, nonspecific findings, and normal). Comorbidities studied included cortical blindness, severe auditory impairment, inability to communicate verbally, assisted feeding, and the presence of afebrile seizures in the prior 12 months. Neuroimaging results were available for a total of 213 children. Only deep gray matter injury (defined as signal abnormality or volume loss in subcortical gray matter, n = 9) was significantly (P < 0.05) linked with the occurrence of both the inability to communicate verbally (n = 5, 55.6% vs n = 46, 22.5%, P = 0.04) and with a higher mean number of comorbidities (1.67 vs 0.70, P < 0.01), and therefore with increased burden of comorbidities.

Although this visual categorization function is traditionally investigated from a unisensory perspective, its early development is inherently constrained by multisensory inputs. In particular, an early-maturing sensory system such as olfaction is ideally suited to support the immature visual system in infancy by providing stability and familiarity to a rapidly changing visual environment. Here, we test the hypothesis that rapid visual categorization of salient visual signals for the young infant brain, human faces, is shaped by another highly relevant human-related input from the olfactory system, the mother's body odor. We observe that a right-hemispheric neural signature of single-glance face categorization from natural images is significantly enhanced in the maternal versus a control odor context in individual 4-month-old infant brains. A lack of difference between odor conditions for the common brain response elicited by both face and non-face images rules out a mere enhancement of arousal or visual attention in the maternal odor context. These observations show that face-selective neural activity in infancy is mediated by the presence of a (maternal) body odor, providing strong support for multisensory inputs driving category acquisition in the developing human brain and having important implications for our understanding of human perceptual development. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,0.35,0,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Previous research on syntactic processing in L2 has mainly focused on how L2 speakers respond to ""objective"" syntactic violations, that is, phrases that are incorrect by native standards. In this study, we investigate how L2 learners, in particular those of less than near-native proficiency, process phrases that deviate from their own, ""subjective,"" and often incorrect syntactic representations, that is, whether they use these subjective and idiosyncratic representations during sentence comprehension. We study this within the domain of grammatical gender in a population of German learners of Dutch, for which systematic errors of grammatical gender are well documented. These L2 learners as well as a control group of Dutch native speakers read Dutch sentences containing gender-marked determiner- noun phrases in which gender agreement was either (objectively) correct or incorrect. Furthermore, the noun targets were selected such that, in a high proportion of nouns, objective and subjective correctness would differ for German learners. The ERP results show a syntactic violation effect (P600) for objective gender agreement violations for native, but not for nonnative speakers. However, when the items were re-sorted for the L2 speakers according to subjective correctness (as assessed offline), the P600 effect emerged as well. Thus, rather than being insensitive to violations of gender agreement, L2 speakers are similarly sensitive as native speakers but base their sensitivity on their subjective- sometimes incorrect-representations. © 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,23.4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We studied 37 subjects diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in one of three categories: fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder. For each subject, the MEG signal was recorded for 60 s during rest while subjects lay supine. Using time series analysis, we calculated the synchronous neural interactions for all pair-wise combinations of 248 MEG sensors resulting in 30,628 partial correlations for each subject. We found significant differences from control subjects in 6.19 % of the partial zero-lag crosscorrelations (synchronous neural interactions; Georgopoulos et al. in J Neural Eng 4:349–355, 2007), with these differences localized in the right posterior frontal, right parietal, and left parietal/posterior frontal regions. These results show that MEG can detect functional brain differences in the individuals affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol. Furthermore, these differences may serve as a biomarker for future studies linking symptoms and signs to specific brain areas. This may lead to new insights into the neuropathology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,15.7,34,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The network consists of two self-organizing maps (a growing semantic map and a growing phonological map) that are connected via associative links trained by Hebbian learning. The model captures a number of important phenomena that occur in early lexical acquisition by children, as it allows for the representation of a dynamically changing linguistic environment in language learning. In our simulations, DevLex develops topographically organized representations for linguistic categories over time, models lexical confusion as a function of word density and semantic similarity, and shows age-of-acquisition effects in the course of learning a growing lexicon. These results match up with patterns from empirical research on lexical development, and have significant implications for models of language acquisition based on self-organizing neural networks. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, recent investigations have shifted from studies of diagnosed patients with schizophrenia to examining their unaffected relatives. Previous studies found that during language processing, relatives thought to be at genetic high-risk for the disorder exhibit aberrant functional activation in regions of language processing, specifically in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area). However, functional connectivity among the regions involved in language pathways is not well understood. In this study, we examined the functional connectivity between a seed located in Broca’s area and the remainder of the brain during a visual lexical decision task, in 20 schizophrenia patients, 21 subjects at genetic high risk for the disorder and 21 healthy controls. Both the high-risk subjects and patients showed significantly reduced activation correlations between seed and regions related to visual language processing. Compared to the high-risk subjects, the schizophrenia patients showed even fewer regions that were correlated with the seed regions. These results suggest that there is aberrant functional connectivity within cortical language circuitry in high-risk subjects and patients with schizophrenia. Broca’s area, which is one of the important regions for language processing in healthy controls, had a significantly reduced role in the high-risk subjects and patients with schizophrenia. Our findings are consistent with the existence of an underlying biological disturbance that begins in genetically at risk individuals and progresses to a greater extent in those who eventually develop schizophrenia.

Previous imaging studies investigating working memory in ADHD have used tasks involving different cognitive resources and ignoring the categorical judgments about objects that are essential parts of performance in visual working memory tasks, thus complicating the interpretation of their findings. In the present study, we explored differential neural activation in children and adolescents with ADHD and in healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with the categorical n-back task (CN-BT), which maximized demands for executive reasoning while holding memory demands constant. Methods: A total of 33 drug-naive, right-handed male ADHD without comorbidity (mean age 9.9 ± 2.4. years) and 27 right-handed, healthy male controls (mean age 10.9 ± 2.7. years) were recruited in the present study. Event-related fMRI was used to study differences in brain activity during the CN-BT between the two groups. Results: The two groups did not differ in their accuracy in the CN-BT, although the ADHD patients showed significantly shorter reaction times to correct responses than did the controls. During the CN-BT, both ADHD patients and controls showed significant positive and negative activations by the correct responses, mainly in the sensory-motor pathways and the striato-cerebellum circuit. Additionally, the ADHD patients showed significantly higher activation in the bilateral globus pallidus and the right hippocampus compared with the controls. There was also a positive correlation between hyperactivation of the left globus pallidus and the reaction time to correct responses in ADHD. Conclusions: In contrast to controls, ADHD patients showed neural hyperactivation in the striatum and mediotemporal areas during a working memory task involving categorization. Hyperfunction in these areas might be the pathophysiological foundation of ADHD, related to the deficits of working memory and the impulsive symptoms. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,10.9,16,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Our aim was to develop a rapid 2D spiral spin-echo sequence for T1-weighted MR imaging with minimal flow artifacts and to compare it with a conventional Cartesian 2D turbo spin-echo sequence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T1-weighted brain imaging was performed in 24 pediatric patients. After the administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast agent, a reference Cartesian TSE sequence with a scanning time of 2 minutes 30 seconds was performed, followed by the proposed spiral spin-echo sequence with a scanning time of 1 minutes 18 seconds, with similar spatial resolution and volumetric coverage. The results were reviewed independently and blindly by 3 neuroradiologists. Scores from a 3-point scale were assigned in 3 categories: flow artifact reduction, subjective preference, and lesion conspicuity, if any. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to evaluate the reviewer scores. The t test was used to evaluate the SNR. The Fleiss k coefficient was calculated to examine interreader agreement. RESULTS: In 23 cases, spiral spin-echo was scored over Cartesian TSE in flow artifact reduction (P <.001). In 21 cases, spiral spin-echo was rated superior in subjective preference (P <.001). Ten patients were identified with lesions, and no statistically significant difference in lesion conspicuity was observed between the 2 sequences. There was no statistically significant difference in SNR between the 2 techniques. The Fleiss k coefficient was 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed spiral spin-echo pulse sequence provides postcontrast images with minimal flow artifacts at a faster scanning time than its Cartesian TSE counterpart.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,6.1,0,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We used the ANEC scoring system (ANE-ss) and standardised neurodevelopmental scores to objectively characterise medium and long term outcomes. Methods Retrospective review of children with ANEC at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, from 2005 to 2012. ANE-ss was determined from clinical features and neuroimaging, and neurodevelopmental scores (Pediatric Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended, Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scale and Pediatric Overall Performance Category scale) were applied at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months post diagnosis. Results Seven patients with ANEC were studied. All had a viral prodrome with fever, and encephalopathy at presentation, and received immunotherapy (steroids or immunoglobulin). ANE-ss scores were medium risk in 4 patients and high risk in 3 patients. One died (high risk ANE-ss) and outcome was determined in the 6 survivors. At 1 month post diagnosis, 3 patients (50%) were mildly affected and 3 (50%) were severely affected. Morbidity rates improved by 12 months, with 67% and 33.3% scoring in the mildly affected and severely affected ranges, respectively. Medium risk patients did well with majority having little or no neurological deficits and good outcome scores. Conclusion Mortality and severe morbidity correlated well with high risk ANE-ss. However, our patients with medium risk ANE-ss had good neurodevelopmental sequelae. Serial disability scoring is useful in evaluating the progress of ANEC patients on follow up.

Methods: We followed up with 44 offspring of parents with BP, subdividing into the HR and UHR categories. The offspring were aged 8-28. years and were free of any current DSM-IV diagnoses. Our multilevel, integrative approach encompassed gray matter (GM) volumes, brain network connectivity, neuropsychological performance, and clinical outcomes. Findings: Compared with the healthy controls (HCs) (n. = 33), the HR offspring (n. = 26) showed GM volume reductions in the right orbitofrontal cortex. Compared with the HR offspring, the UHR offspring (n = 18) exhibited increased GM volumes in four regions. Both the HR and UHR offspring displayed abnormalities in the inferior occipital cortex regarding the measures of degree and centrality, reflecting the connections and roles of the region, respectively. In the UHR versus the HR offspring, the UHR offspring exhibited upwards-shifted small world topologies that reflect high clustering and efficiency in the brain networks. Compared with the HCs, the UHR offspring had significantly lower assortativity, which was suggestive of vulnerability. Finally, processing speed, visual-spatial, and general function were impaired in the UHR offspring but not in the HR offspring. Interpretation: The abnormalities observed in the HR offspring appear to be inherited, whereas those associated with the UHR offspring represent stage-specific changes predisposing them to developing the disorder. © 2015 The Authors.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,15.9,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic headaches were defined by the International Headache Society in 2004 and are helpful for classification. Evaluation must be done on an individual basis, and patients who do not clear their symptoms may need neuroimaging. The headaches fall into the category of chronic tension-type headache as well as headaches compatible with migraine and are treated in a similar fashion.

The present study addressed processing of emotional prosodic changes in natural speech stimuli in school-age children (mean age 10. years) by recording the electroencephalogram, facial electromyography, and behavioral responses. The stimulus was a semantically neutral Finnish word uttered with four different emotional connotations: neutral, commanding, sad, and scornful. In the behavioral sound-discrimination task the reaction times were fastest for the commanding stimulus and longest for the scornful stimulus, and faster for the neutral than for the sad stimulus. EEG and EMG responses were measured during non-attentive oddball paradigm. Prosodic changes elicited a negative-going, fronto-centrally distributed neural response peaking at about 500. ms from the onset of the stimulus, followed by a fronto-central positive deflection, peaking at about 740. ms. For the commanding stimulus also a rapid negative deflection peaking at about 290. ms from stimulus onset was elicited. No reliable stimulus type specific rapid facial reactions were found. The results show that prosodic changes in natural speech stimuli activate pre-attentive neural change-detection mechanisms in school-age children.

The timing of neurophysiological responses in visual cortex plays a key role in distinguishing between bottom-up and top-down theories. Here, we quantified at millisecond resolution the amount of visual information conveyed by intracranial field potentials from 912 electrodes in 11 human subjects. We could decode object category information from human visual cortex in single trials as early as 100 ms poststimulus. Decoding performance was robust to depth rotation and scale changes.

However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this trade-off. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodology, we concurrently asked participants to recognize and categorize own- and other-race faces to examine the neural correlates of this trade-off relationship. We found that for other-race faces, the fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA) responded more to recognition than categorization, whereas for own-race faces, the responses were equal for the 2 tasks. The right superior temporal sulcus (STS) responses were the opposite to those of the FFA and OFA. Further, recognition enhanced the functional connectivity from the right FFA to the right STS, whereas categorization enhanced the functional connectivity from the right OFA to the right STS. The modulatory effects of these 2 couplings were negatively correlated. Our findings suggested that within the core face processing network, although recognizing and categorizing own- and other-race faces activated the same neural substrates, there existed neural trade-offs whereby their activations and functional connectivities were modulated by face race type and task demand due to one’s differential processing expertise with own- and other-race faces.

Moreover, phonology has to often be retrieved from memory during reading because of the inconsistent mapping between characters and their pronunciations. Using optimized voxel-based morphometry, we examined differences in volumetrics between children with reading disability (RD, 10-12 years old) and age-matched typically developing (TD) children. Our study shows reduced gray matter volume (GMV) for RD in right inferior occipital gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus, consistent with previous studies suggesting that Chinese dyslexics have deficits in orthographic and phonological processing. The deficit in phonological processing was further supported by reductions in white matter volumes (WMV) in left precentral gyrus. Greater deficits in ortho-phonological processing may be associated with semantic compensation, as lower skill RD children showed greater GMV in anterior temporal cortex, even though as a group they showed less GMV in this region compared to TD. Perhaps most interestingly, we showed reduced GMV in bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortices (vmPFC) and this was correlated with reductions in WMV within vmPFC, suggesting that RD have deficits in memory retrieval. Moreover, these GMV alterations in vmPFC for the RD were correlated with alterations in right parahippocampal gyrus, which also showed a reduced GMV, suggesting that RD have a correlated deficit in memory encoding. Our results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that Chinese dyslexics have deficits in visuo-orthographic and phonological processing, but our study importantly suggests deficits in memory encoding and retrieval, perhaps due to the unique demands of the Chinese writing system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,11.75,12,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Importantly, however, a precise characterization of plasticity and its underlying mechanism has the potential to enable new approaches for enhancing reorganization of cortical function. Investigations of the impairment and subsequent recovery of cognitive and perceptual functions following early-onset cortical lesions in humans provide a unique opportunity to elucidate how the brain changes, adapts, and reorganizes. Specifically, here, we focus on restitution of visual function, and we review the findings on plasticity and re-organization of the ventral occipital temporal cortex (VOTC) in published reports of 46 patients with a lesion to or resection of the visual cortex early in life. Findings reveal that a lesion to the VOTC results in a deficit that affects the visual recognition of more than one category of stimuli (faces, objects and words). In addition, the majority of pediatric patients show limited recovery over time, especially those in whom deficits in low-level vision also persist. Last, given that neither the equipotentiality nor the modularity view on plasticity was clearly supported, we suggest some intermediate possibilities in which some plasticity may be evident but that this might depend on the area that was affected, its maturational trajectory as well as its structural and functional connectivity constraints.

Using psychophysical and fMRI investigations, we compared the neural and visuoperceptual profiles of 10 children or adolescents following unilateral cortical resections and their age- and gender-matched controls. Dramatically, with the exception of two individuals, both of whom had relatively greater cortical alterations, all patients showed normal perceptual performance on tasks of intermediate- and high-level vision, including face and object recognition. Consistently, again with the exception of the same two individuals, both univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses revealed normal selectivity and representational structure of category-selective regions. Furthermore, the spatial organization of category-selective regions obeyed the typical medial-to-lateral topographic organization albeit unilaterally in the structurally preserved hemisphere rather than bilaterally. These findings offer novel insights into the malleability of cortex in the pediatric population and suggest that, although experience may be necessary for the emergence of neural category-selectivity, this emergence is not necessarily contingent on the integrity of particular cortical structures.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT One approach to reduce seizure activity in patients with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy involves the resection of the epileptogenic focus. The impact of these resections on the perceptual behaviors and organization of visual cortex remain largely unexplored. Here, we characterized the visuoperceptual and neural profiles of ventral visual cortex in a relatively large sample of post-resection pediatric patients. Two major findings emerged. First, most patients exhibited preserved visuoperceptual performance across a wide-range of visual behaviors. Second, normal topography, magnitude, and representational structure of category-selective organization were uncovered in the spared hemisphere. These comprehensive imaging and behavioral investigations uncovered novel evidence concerning the neural representations and visual functions in children who have undergone cortical resection, and have implications for cortical plasticity more generally.

Previous studies tried to reveal these plastic effects of age of second language acquisition (AoA-L2) and proficiency-level in L2 (PL-L2) on the neural basis of language processing in bilinguals. Although different activation patterns have been observed during language processing in early and late bilinguals by task-fMRI, few studies reported the effect of AoA-L2 and high PL-L2 on language network at resting state. In this study, we acquired resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) data from 10 Cantonese (L1)-Mandarin (L2) early bilinguals (acquired L2: 3 years old) and 11 late bilinguals (acquired L2: 6 years old), and analyzed their topological properties of language networks after controlling the language daily exposure and usage as well as PL in L1 and L2. We found that early bilinguals had significantly a higher clustering coefficient, global and local efficiency, but significantly lower characteristic path length compared to late bilinguals. Modular analysis indicated that compared to late bilinguals, early bilinguals showed significantly stronger intra-modular functional connectivity in the semantic and phonetic modules, stronger inter-modular functional connectivity between the semantic and phonetic modules as well as between the phonetic and syntactic modules. Differences in global and local parameters may reflect different patterns of neuro-plasticity respectively for early and late bilinguals. These results suggested that different L2 experience influences topological properties of language network, even if late bilinguals achieve high PL-L2.

Here, in a total of 38 subjects, the functional anatomy of cross-modal semantic similarity for concrete words was determined based on a dual criterion: First, a voxelwise univariate analysis had to show significant activation during a semantic task (property verification) performed with written and spoken concrete words compared to the perceptually matched control condition. Second, in an independent dataset, in these clusters, the similarity in fMRI response pattern to two distinct entities, one presented as a written and the other as a spoken word, had to correlate with the similarity in meaning between these entities. The left ventral occipitotemporal transition zone and ventromedial temporal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, pars orbitalis bilaterally, and the left pars triangularis were all activated in the univariate contrast. Only the left pars triangularis showed a cross-modal semantic similarity effect. There was no effect of phonological nor orthographic similarity in this region. The cross-modal semantic similarity effect was confirmed by a secondary analysis in the cytoarchitectonically defined BA45. A semantic similarity effect was also present in the ventral occipital regions but only within the visual modality, and in the anterior superior temporal cortex only within the auditory modality. This study provides direct evidence for the coding of word meaning in BA45 and positions its contribution to semantic processing at the confluence of input-modality specific pathways that code for meaning within the respective input modalities. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,28,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Method A cranial imaging-based scoring system was devised using both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data. Patients were grouped into diagnostic categories where a definitive molecular diagnosis was known, or where the clinical and radiological features suggested a specific diagnosis. For patients in whom the diagnosis was unknown, subgroups were defined according to shared radiological features. Results Data on 244 scans from 119 patients were analysed. A specific diagnosis was available for 59 patients (31males, 28 females; median age 50mo, range 1wk to 54y). These were as follows (number of patients in brackets): Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (33), cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcification and cysts (10), band-like calcification with simplified gyration and polymicrogyria (6), COL4A1-related disease (3), Degos disease (2), Krabbe disease (2), Alexander disease (1), mitochondrial disease (1), and tetrasomy 15 (1). In 60 patients the aetiology was unknown. Within this group, subsets demonstrating shared characteristics suggestive of a specific calcification phenotype could be identified. Interpretation This study confirms the value of a systematic approach to radiological phenotyping of disorders associated with intracranial calcification.

Despite the striking nature of the autistic language impairment, knowledge about its corresponding alterations in the brain is still evolving. We hypothesized that the dual stream language network is altered in autism, and that this alteration could be revealed by changes in the relationships between microstructural integrity and functional activation. The study recruited 20 right-handed male youths with autism and 20 carefully matched individually, typically developing (TD) youths. Microstructural integrity of the left dorsal and left ventral pathways responsible for language processing and the functional activation of the connected brain regions were investigated by using diffusion spectrum imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging of a semantic task, respectively. Youths with autism had significantly poorer language function, and lower functional activation in left dorsal and left ventral regions of the language network, compared with TD youths. The TD group showed a significant correlation of the functional activation of the left dorsal region with microstructural integrity of the left ventral pathway, whereas the autism group showed a significant correlation of the functional activation of the left ventral region with microstructural integrity of the left dorsal pathway, and moreover verbal comprehension index was correlated with microstructural integrity of the left ventral pathway. These altered structure-function relationships in autism suggest possible involvement of the dual pathways in supporting deficient semantic processing. © 2013 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,13.7,18,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In VA span impaired dyslexic children, poor performance on letter report tasks is associated with reduced parietal activations for multiple letter processing. While this hints towards a non-specific, attention-based dysfunction, it is still unclear whether reduced parietal activity generalizes to other types of stimuli. Furthermore, putative links between reduced parietal activity and reduced ventral occipito-temporal (vOT) in dyslexia have yet to be explored. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured brain activity in 12 VA span impaired dyslexic adults and 12 adult skilled readers while they carried out a categorization task on single or multiple alphanumeric or non-alphanumeric characters. While healthy readers activated parietal areas more strongly for multiple than single element processing (right-sided for alphanumeric and bilateral for non-alphanumeric), similar stronger multiple element right parietal activations were absent for dyslexic participants. Contrasts between skilled and dyslexic readers revealed significantly reduced right superior parietal lobule (SPL) activity for dyslexic readers regardless of stimuli type. Using a priori anatomically defined regions of interest, we showed that neural activity was reduced for dyslexic participants in both SPL and vOT bilaterally. Finally, we used multiple regressions to test whether SPL activity was related to vOT activity in each group. In the left hemisphere, SPL activity covaried with vOT activity for both normal and dyslexic readers. In contrast, in the right hemisphere, SPL activity covaried with vOT activity only for dyslexic readers. These results bring critical support to the VA interpretation of the VA Span deficit. In addition, they offer a new insight on how deficits in automatic vOT based word recognition could arise in developmental dyslexia. © 2014 Lobier, Peyrin, Pichat, Le Bas and Valdois.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,23.8,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In children, this left hemispheric cortical specialization for letter strings is typically detected only after approximately 1 y of formal schooling and reading acquisition. Here, we recorded scalp electrophysiological (EEG) brain responses in 5-y-old (n = 40) prereaders presented with letter strings appearing every five items in rapid streams of pseudofonts (6 items per second). Within 2 min of recording only, letter strings evoked a robust specific response over the left occipito- Temporal cortex at the predefined frequency of 1.2 Hz (i.e., 6 Hz/5). Interindividual differences in the amplitude of this electrophysiological response are significantly related to letter knowledge, a preschool predictor of later reading ability. These results point to the high potential of this rapidly collected behavior-free measure to assess reading ability in developmental populations. These findings were replicated in a second experiment (n = 26 preschool children),where familiar symbols and line drawings of objects evoked right-lateralized and bilaterally specific responses, respectively, showing the specificity of the early left hemispheric dominance for letter strings. Collectively, these findings indicate that limited knowledge of print in young children, before formal education, is sufficient to develop specialized left lateralized neuronal circuits, thereby pointing to an early onset and rapid impact of left hemispheric reentrant sound mapping on posterior cortical development.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,5.5,5,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Preschool children were given a mapping task in which they were asked to find a 'winner' placed in a three-tiered box after seeing one placed in a virtually identical box. The correct choice was determined by finding the corresponding relative location in the test box, making it a difficult task for preschool children. We found that hearing language for spatial relations facilitated children's mapping performance. We found effects at younger ages on easier tasks (Experiments 1 and 2) and at older ages on harder tasks (Experiment 3). The effects of spatial relational language differed predictably according to the semantics of the terms children heard (Experiment 4). Finally, the effects of spatial language were maintained over time (Experiment 5): children given one initial exposure to the spatial terms maintained their advantage over baseline children when they again carried out the mapping task 2 days later, with no further exposure to the spatial terms. The evidence is consistent with the explanation that language bolsters children's spatial encodings, which in turn supports their mapping performance.

In half these cases, the patient had already experienced more than one seizure at the time of diagnosis. Patients presenting only one seizure but either a case history or significant EEG or neuroimaging abnormalities suggestive of a high risk of recurrence were classified as cases of epilepsy. Drug treatment was prescribed to 73p. 100 of the cohort. Treatment was far more frequent in cases where seizure had recurred (90p. 100) than in cases of first seizure (54p. 100) (p<0.0001). In the latter category, the older the patients, the more likely they were to be treated (69p. 100 of patients ≥60 years old versus 49p. 100 of those under 24 years of age, p=0.001). Those with multiple onset were more often treated than those with single onset (48p. 100 of cases of single seizure versus 80p. 100 of clustered seizures and 90p. 100 of status epilepticus, p<0.0001), as were cases of complex partial seizure (68p. 100 versus just under 50p. 100 of cases of generalized seizure, p=0.0001), those with epileptiform EEG abnormalities (67p. 100 of cases of cryptogenic partial epilepsy and 63p. 100 of idiopathic generalized epilepsy versus 42p. 100 of isolated seizure, p<0.0001) and those with cerebral lesions visible by neuroimagery (89p. 100 of cases of symptomatic partial epilepsy).

In the ERPs, rhyme processing produced more pronounced group differences than did semantic processing at about 480 msec, with a relatively more negative distribution for the impaired readers at centroparietal sites. At about 800 msec in both classification tasks, the impaired readers displayed a late positivity that was delayed in latency and of larger amplitude at frontal sites than that for the average readers.

Previous studies have shown that there is a hierarchy of responses from posterior to anterior vOT regions (along the y-axis) that corresponds with increasing levels of recognition—from perceptual to semantic processing, respectively. In contrast, the functional differences between superior and inferior vOT responses (i.e. along the z-axis) have not yet been elucidated. To investigate, we conducted an extensive review of the literature and found that peak activation for reading varies by more than 1 cm in the z-axis. In addition, we investigated functional differences between superior and inferior parts of left vOT by analysing functional MRI data from 58 neurologically normal skilled readers performing 8 different visual processing tasks. We found that group activation in superior vOT was significantly more sensitive than inferior vOT to the type of task, with more superior vOT activation when participants were matching visual stimuli for their semantic or perceptual content than producing speech to the same stimuli. This functional difference along the z-axis was compared to existing boundaries between cytoarchitectonic areas around the OTs. In addition, using dynamic causal modelling, we show that connectivity from superior vOT to anterior vOT increased with semantic content during matching tasks but not during speaking tasks whereas connectivity from inferior vOT to anterior vOT was sensitive to semantic content for matching and speaking tasks. The finding of a functional dissociation between superior and inferior parts of vOT has implications for predicting deficits and response to rehabilitation for patients with partial damage to vOT following stroke or neurosurgery.

Evidence from neurophysiologic and functional neuroimaging suggests that epileptic seizures and/or epileptiform activity can be the dominant factors inhibiting specific brain areas. However, most previous studies were focused on cognitive performance in children. In this study, we analyzed a new cohort of adult patients with frequent interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Methods: Data from 67 adult patients with epilepsy were reviewed. Electroencephalography (EEG)-video recording and cognitive testing were performed, and the IED index was estimated as a percentage assigned to one of four categories (<. 1%, 1-10%, 10-50%, and >. 50%) during either wakefulness or sleep. Correlations of cognitive test results and clinical characteristics of IED categories were analyzed. The effects of the frequency, duration, location, and sleep-wake cycles of IEDs on cognition (intelligence and memory capacity) were analyzed. Results: Patients with an IED index >. 10% showed impaired performance on the Chinese Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-RC) and the Chinese Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS). This effect was detected independently from other IED frequencies and other IED-related variables, such as duration, distribution, and location. The impact of waking or sleeping IEDs was of equal importance in contributing to impaired WAIS-RC and WMS performance. Conclusion: An IED frequency of more than 10% in both waking and sleeping EEGs is associated with impaired cognitive performance in adult patients. However, whether patients with a high IED frequency but low seizure frequency will benefit from antiepileptic treatment should be examined in future studies. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Study design: A retrospective chart review was carried out on all patients referred to a single university-based pediatric neurologist for evaluation of global developmental delay from July 1991 to December 1993. Patients referred because of isolated speech or motor delay or autism or those who had been previously evaluated by another neurologist were excluded. Results: A total of 77 patients were identified; 47 were male, and 62 were referred by a pediatrician. Neurologic evaluation did not confirm global delay in 10, and 8 did not complete diagnostic evaluation; one child was included in both groups. Of the remaining 60, an etiologic diagnosis was suspected by the referring physician at the time of referral in 13. Although parents suspected a delay at a mean age of 0.66 (±0.69) year, children were examined by the neurologist at a mean age of 3.58 (±2.42) years. Twenty-five were mildly delayed, 23 were moderately delayed, and 12 were severely delayed. Diagnostic studies (history, physical examination, and selected investigations, including screens for metabolic disease, karyotype, fragile X testing, electroencephalography, and neuroimaging) yielded an etiologic diagnosis in 38 (63.3%) of the 60 patients. Etiologic categories included cerebral dysgenesis (16.7%), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (10.0%), chromosomal abnormalities (10%), toxins (8.3%), metabolic disorders (5.0%), and neurocutaneous (3.3%), neuromuscular (3.3%), genetic/dysmorphic (3.3%), and epileptic (3.3%) syndromes. Etiologic yield was equivalent across categories and degree of developmental delay. Conclusion: Referral to a pediatric neurologist and application of a selected battery of investigations yield etiologic findings with important implications with respect to management, prognosis, and recurrence risk estimate in a significant portion of globally delayed children.

Method: Fifteen children with BECTS (age. = 11y 1m ± 16 m; 12 boys) and 18 healthy controls (age. = 11 y 8m ± 20 m; 11 boys) performed an fMRI reading comprehension task in which they read a pair of syntactically complex sentences and decided whether the target sentence (the second sentence in the pair) was true or false with respect to the first sentence. All children also underwent an exhaustive neuropsychological assessment. Results: We demonstrated weaknesses in several cognitive domains in BECTS children. During the sentence reading fMRI task, left inferior frontal regions and bilateral temporal areas were activated in BECTS children and healthy controls. However, additional brain regions such as the left hippocampus and precuneus were activated in BECTS children. Moreover, specific activation was found in the left caudate and putamen in BECTS children but not in healthy controls. Cognitive results and accuracy during the fMRI task were associated with specific brain activation patterns. Conclusion: BECTS children recruited a wider network to perform the fMRI sentence reading comprehension task, with specific activation in the left dorsal striatum. BECTS cognitive performance differently predicted functional activation in frontal and temporal regions compared to controls, suggesting differences in brain network organisation that contribute to reading comprehension. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,exclude,11.67,14,"""We generated regions of interest (ROIs) based on the theoretical assumptions of the above-described reading network...""",visual two–sentence comprehension judgment vs. symbol detection,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In this “fast” localizer paradigm, items are presented in groups of four; within sets, words are related in orthographic, phonological, and/or semantic properties. We tested this protocol with a group of skilled adult readers (N=18). Analyses uncovered key regions of the reading network that were sensitive to different component processes at the group level; namely, left fusiform gyrus as well as the pars opercularis subregion of inferior frontal gyrus were sensitive to lexicality; several regions including left precentral gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus were sensitive to spelling-sound consistency; the pars triangularis subregion of inferior frontal gyrus was sensitive to semantic similarity. Additionally, in a number of key brain regions, activation in response to semantically similar words was related to individual differences in reading comprehension outside the scanner. Importantly, these findings are in line with previous investigations of the reading network, yet data were obtained using much less imaging time than comparable paradigms currently available, especially relative to the number of indices of component processes obtained. This feature, combined with the relatively simple nature of the task, renders it appropriate for groups of subjects with a wide range of reading abilities, including children with impairments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,24,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Perceptual analysis of stimuli dealing with the exact discrimination of size and dimension is related more to mathematical abilities (MATH), while perceptual analysis of direction and spatial orientation is related more to abilities in reading and reading comprehension (READ). Some stimuli are MIXED since they deal with both of the above features combined. We previously determined the distributed neuronal network of analytical-specific visual perceptual processes as measured by the Mangina-Test. Here, we aim at further assessing as to how brain activity is differentially modulated by the discrimination of very subtle category-specific perceptual relationships. Brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging in 12 young healthy subjects while they performed a computer-adapted version of the Mangina-Test. Behavioral results of the present study indicate that performance was not different among stimulus categories. However, brain functional data show that analytical-specific perceptual processes for MATH, READ and MIXED stimuli rely on partially distinct brain circuits. Bilateral posterior parietal, premotor and prefrontal regions along with the anterior cingulate appeared to be more activated by MATH stimuli, while READ stimuli predominantly activated bilateral medial occipito-temporal, amygdala/parahippocampal and sensorimotor cortices, and the right inferior frontal cortex. Moreover, the posterior parahippocampal cortex showed a higher activity specifically for MIXED stimuli. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that in the Mangina-Test, the exact discrimination of very subtle perceptual relationships between geometrical stimuli distinctly modulates cerebral activity, so that category-specific brain responses can be related to identifiable cognitive abilities.

Previously, the role of the X chromosome was considered important in the ASD mainly because autistic symptoms were detected in genetic syndromes involving X chromosome (fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome). Instead, few studies have analyzed the possible role of the Y chromosome in the ASD. This study explores the role of the Y chromosome in ASD through a systematic literature review about the association between ASD and XYY syndrome and a description of two new cases with this association. The literature review considered studies published in peer-reviewed journals, included in the MEDLINE and PubMed databases, that examined the association between ASD and XYY syndrome. Few studies reported the occurrence of ASD in children with XYY karyotype and the majority of them did not reported a well-defined autism diagnostic category associated with an extra Y chromosome, but several clinical conditions that are generically described as language and social impairment. Conclusion: This study underlines the underestimated role of the Y chromosome in ASD, and we postulate that all the ASD associated with the XYY karyotype may presumably fall within mild degree of ASD as in our cases. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

It induces a lack or loss of access to the motor engrams that plan and programme the graphomotor movements necessary to produce written output. The neural network subserving handwriting includes the superior parietal region, the dorsolateral and medial premotor cortex and the thalamus of the dominant hemisphere. Recent studies indicate that the cerebellum may be involved as well. To the best of our knowledge, apraxic agraphia has not been described on a developmental basis. This paper reports the clinical, neurocognitive and (functional) neuroimaging findings of a 15-year-old left-handed patient with an isolated, non-progressive developmental handwriting disorder consistent with a diagnosis of «apraxic dysgraphia». Gross motor coordination problems were objectified as well but no signs of cerebellar, sensorimotor or extrapyramidal dysfunction of the writing limb were found to explain the apraxic phenomena. Brain MRI revealed no supra- and infratentorial damage but quantified Tc-99m-ECD SPECT disclosed decreased perfusion in the anatomoclinically suspected prefrontal and cerebellar brain regions crucially involved in the planning and execution of skilled motor actions. This pattern of functional depression seems to support the hypothesis that «apraxic dysgraphia» might reflect incomplete maturation of the cerebello-cerebral network involved in handwriting. In addition, it is hypothesized that ""apraxic dysgraphia"" may have to be considered to represent a distinct nosological category within the group of the developmental dyspraxias following dysfunction of the cerebello-cerebral network involved in planned actions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

A close interplay between three main strands of contemporary neuroscience induced a substantial modification of the traditional view of the cerebellum as a mere coordinator of autonomic and somatic motor functions. Indeed, the wealth of current evidence derived from detailed neuroanatomical investigations, functional neuroimaging studies with healthy subjects and patients and in-depth neuropsychological assessment of patients with cerebellar disorders shows that the cerebellum has a cardinal role to play in affective regulation, cognitive processing, and linguistic function. Although considerable progress has been made in models of cerebellar function, controversy remains regarding the exact role of the 'linguistic cerebellum' in a broad variety of nonmotor language processes. This consensus paper brings together a range of different viewpoints and opinions regarding the contribution of the cerebellum to language function. Recent developments and insights in the nonmotor modulatory role of the cerebellum in language and some related disorders will be discussed. The role of the cerebellum in speech and language perception, in motor speech planning including apraxia of speech, in verbal working memory, in phonological and semantic verbal fluency, in syntax processing, in the dynamics of language production, in reading and in writing will be addressed. In addition, the functional topography of the linguistic cerebellum and the contribution of the deep nuclei to linguistic function will be briefly discussed.

It is widely assumed that adults fully retain the capacity they used to acquire literacy as children for their native language (L1). However, given basic principles of neural plasticity and a limited body of empirical evidence, this assumption merits investigation. Accordingly, the current work used an artificial orthography approach to investigate behavioral and neural measures of learning as adult participants acquired a second orthography for English across six weeks of training. One group learned HouseFont, an alphabetic system in which house images are used to represent English phonemes, and the other learned Faceabary, an alphasyllabic system in which face images are used to represent English syllables. The findings demonstrate that adults have considerable capacity to learn a second orthography, even when it involves perceptually atypical graphs, as evidenced by performance improvements that were sustained across weeks of training. They also demonstrate that this learning involves assimilation into the same reading network that supports native literacy, as evidenced by learning related changes in orthographic, phonological, and semantic regions associated with English word reading. Additionally, we found learning patterns that varied across the two orthographies. Faceabary induced bilateral learning effects in the mid-fusiform gyrus and showed greater engagement of regions associated with semantic processing. We speculate the large graph inventories of non-alphabetic systems may create visual-perceptual challenges that increase reliance on holistic reading procedures and associated neural substrates. © 2018",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,20,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

A dermal sinus tract (DST) consists of a duct communicating to the skin with deep structures that carries an important risk of infection. A different lesion consisting of a translucent skin opening and a fibrous tract that lacks a lumen can also be found in OSD. We termed this lesion pseudo-dermal sinus tract. Patients and methods: We reviewed clinical features of 20 patients with spinal skin orifices. The patients were classified into two categories: group 1 comprised children with true DST and group 2 included patients with skin dimples resembling a DST. Aims: The aim of this study was to analyze differential features of patients in these two groups as they behaved dissimilarly in regard to clinical significance and outcomes, especially those concerning infectious risk. Results: Children of group 1 (n = 8) presented with tiny skin orifices and with superficial or deep infection. In contrast, group 2 (n = 12) mostly manifested with neurological symptoms. No patient in group 2 developed an infection preoperatively. In both groups, magnetic resonance showed tracts that ended in different structures. Histopathology of the lesions were dissimilar, those of group 1 being hollow tubular structures lined by epithelium while those of group 2 being solid tracts of fibrous connective tissue. Conclusions: DST constitutes a clinicopathological diagnosis. Although sharing some common cutaneous and neuroimaging findings, both groups behaved differently. Patients of group 1 tended to show up with infection requiring urgent surgery.

There are no early severity predictors for this disorder and no phenotype-genotype correlation. We performed a detailed dysmorphology evaluation to describe facial gestalt and its changes over time, to train digital recognition facial analysis tools and to identify early severity predictors. Methods Paediatric PMM2-CDG patients were evaluated and compared with controls. A computer-assisted recognition tool was trained. Through the evaluation of dysmorphic features (DFs), a simple categorisation was created and correlated with clinical and neurological scores, and neuroimaging. Results Dysmorphology analysis of 31 patients (4-19 years of age) identified eight major DFs (strabismus, upslanted eyes, long fingers, lipodystrophy, wide mouth, inverted nipples, long philtrum and joint laxity) with predictive value using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curveanalysis (p<0.001). Dysmorphology categorisation using lipodystrophy and inverted nipples was employed to divide patients into three groups that are correlated with global clinical and neurological scores, and neuroimaging (p=0.005, 0.003 and 0.002, respectively). After Face2Gene training, PMM2-CDG patients were correctly identified at different ages. Conclusions PMM2-CDG patients' DFs are consistent and inform about clinical severity when no clear phenotype-genotype correlation is known. We propose a classification of DFs into major and minor with diagnostic risk implications. At present, Face2Gene is useful to suggest PMM2-CDG. Regarding the prognostic value of DFs, we elaborated a simple severity dysmorphology categorisation with predictive value, and we identified five major DFs associated with clinical severity.

Many of them rely on multisite designs, with the recruitment of larger samples  increasing statistical power. However, recent large-scale studies have put some  findings into question, considering the results to be strongly dependent on the  database used, and demonstrating the substantial heterogeneity within this  clinically defined category. One major source of variance may be the acquisition of  the data in multiple centres. In this work we analysed the differences found in the  multisite, multi-modal neuroimaging database from the UK Medical Research Council  Autism Imaging Multicentre Study (MRC AIMS) in terms of both diagnosis and  acquisition sites. Since the dissimilarities between sites were higher than between  diagnostic groups, we developed a technique called Significance Weighted Principal  Component Analysis (SWPCA) to reduce the undesired intensity variance due to  acquisition site and to increase the statistical power in detecting group  differences. After eliminating site-related variance, statistically significant  group differences were found, including Broca's area and the temporo-parietal  junction. However, discriminative power was not sufficient to classify diagnostic  groups, yielding accuracies results close to random. Our work supports recent claims  that ASD is a highly heterogeneous condition that is difficult to globally  characterize by neuroimaging, and therefore different (and more homogenous)  subgroups should be defined to obtain a deeper understanding of ASD.

Emerging research suggests that aberrant saliency processing underlies the link between early trauma exposure and later cognitive and socioemotional deficits that are hallmark of several psychiatric disorders. Here, we examine brain and behavioral responses during a face categorization conflict task, and relate these to intrinsic connectivity of the salience network (SN). The results demonstrate a unique pattern of SN dysfunction in youth exposed to trauma (n = 14) relative to comparison youth (n = 19) matched on age, sex, IQ, and sociodemographic risk. We find that trauma-exposed youth are more susceptible to conflict interference and this correlates with higher fronto-insular responses during conflict. Resting-state functional connectivity data collected in the same participants reveal increased connectivity of the insula to SN seed regions that is associated with diminished reward sensitivity, a critical risk/resilience trait following stress. In addition to altered intrinsic connectivity of the SN, we observed altered connectivity between the SN and default mode network (DMN) in trauma-exposed youth. These data uncover network-level disruptions in brain organization following one of the strongest predictors of illness, early life trauma, and demonstrate the relevance of observed neural effects for behavior and specific symptom dimensions. SN dysfunction may serve as a diathesis that contributes to illness and negative outcomes following childhood trauma. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,12.06,NaN,"max age missing, but likely to be > 15 (SD = 2.66); aslo check task",visual face–gender word conflict task,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Oxytocin appears to be a potent modulator of amygdala reactivity and neuroendocrine responses to psychosocial stress. Given these stress regulatory effects, there is increasing interest in understanding the role of oxytocin in vulnerability to stress-related clinical disorders. The present study examines the impact of a common functional variant within the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene (rs2254298) on structure and function of the amygdala in a high-risk sample of urban, low-income, minority youth with a high incidence of early life stress (ELS). Compared to G/G homozygotes, youth carrying the OXTR A-allele showed increased amygdala volume, reduced behavioral performance, and heightened amygdala response during two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks that involved viewing socially-relevant face stimuli. Higher amygdala response was related to ELS in A-allele carriers but not G/G homozygotes. These findings underscore a series of relations among a common oxytocin system gene variant, ELS exposure, and structure and function of the amygdala in early life. Heightened amygdala response to salient social cues in OXTR A-allele carriers may elevate risk for emotional psychopathology by increasing amygdala involvement in disambiguating environmental cues, particularly for individuals with ELS.

This ""persistent generalized muscle contraction"" is often associated with bad humor, sleep disturbance, hyperhidrosis, wasting, elevation of serum creatine kinase levels, regular daytime use of hypnotic or sedative medication, and the necessity to maintain the neck or hip in a flexed position manually. The aim of this study is to elucidate the clinical profile of this condition. Methods: We retrospectively examined the medical records and brain imaging data of 66 SMID patients in the state of persistent generalized muscle contraction. Results: Most patients could be classified into 2 major categories on the basis of clinical presentation and brain imaging : (A) those with premature birth and bilateral lesion of globus pallidus interna (kernicterus) (n=16), and (B) those with various widespread bilateral basal ganglia/thalamic and/or cerebral lesions such as hypoxia-ischemia, acute encephalopathy, malformation, etc (n=50). Group A assumed an asymmetrical tonic-neck-reflex-like position, torsion of the trunk, fluctuation of hypertonia, and better mental development. Three of them exhibited extreme hypertonia resembling status dystonicus. Group B often exhibited persistent and fixed retroflexion of the neck and trunk or opisthotonus. Drugs such as oral muscular relaxants were ineffective in both groups. Injection of botulinum toxin into the cervical and paravertebral muscles partially alleviated symptoms. Conclusions: Persistent generalized muscle contraction in SMID has at least two different types. Group A has characteristics of severe dystonic hypertonia that could lead to status dystonicus.

Although the diagnosis of craniosynostosis is primarily the result of physical examination, craniometrics measuring, and observation of the skull deformity, the radiological assessment currently plays an important role in the confirmation of the diagnosis, the surgical planning, and even the postoperative follow-up.

Methods, results and conclusions: This review aims at summarizing the state of the art of the role of radiology in craniosynostosis, mainly focusing on indications and techniques, to provide an update not only to pediatric neurosurgeons or maxillofacial surgeons but also to all the other specialists involved in their management, like neonatologists, pediatricians, clinical geneticists, and pediatric neurologists. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Recent work has suggested that semantic combination is supported by the ATL and the AG, with a division of labor in which AG is involved in event concepts and ATL is involved in encoding conceptual features of entities and/or more general forms of semantic combination. The current fMRI study was designed to refine hypotheses about the angular gyrus processes in question. In particular, we ask whether the AG supports the computation of argument structure (a linguistic notion that depends on a verb taking other phrases as arguments) or the computation of event concepts more broadly. To distinguish these possibilities we used a novel, lexically-matched contrast: noun phrases (NP) (the frightened boy) and verb phrases (VP) (frightened the boy), where VPs contained argument structure, denoting an event and assigning a thematic role to its argument, and NPs did not, denoting only a semantically enriched entity. Results showed that while many regions showed increased activity for NPs and VPs relative to unstructured word lists (AG, ATL, pSTS, anterior IFG), replicating evidence of their involvement in combinatorial processing, neither AG or ATL showed differences in activation between the VP and NP conditions. These results suggest that increased AG activity does not reflect the computation of argument structure per se, but are compatible with a view in which the AG represents event information denoted by words such as frightened independent of their grammatical context. By contrast, pSTS and posterior IFG did show increased activation for the VPs relative to NPs. We suggest that these effects may reflect differences in syntactic processing and working memory engaged by different structural relations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,22,27,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Although caregivers are known to regulate the usage of IDS (linguistic and emotional components) depending on their child’s development, the underlying neural substrates of this flexible modification are largely unknown. Here, using an auditory observation method and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of four different groups of females, we revealed the experience-dependent influence of the emotional component on linguistic processing in the right caudate nucleus when mothers process IDS: (1) non-mothers, who do not use IDS regularly, showed no significant difference between IDS and adult-directed speech (ADS); (2) mothers with preverbal infants, who primarily use the emotional component of IDS, showed the main effect of the emotional component of IDS; (3) mothers with toddlers at the two-word stage, who use both linguistic and emotional components of IDS, showed an interaction between the linguistic and emotional components of IDS; and (4) mothers with school-age children, who use ADS rather than IDS toward their children, showed a tendency toward the main effect of ADS. The task that was most comparable to the naturalistic categories of IDS (i.e., explicit-language and implicit-emotion processing) recruited the right caudate nucleus, but it was not recruited in the control, less naturalistic condition (explicit-emotion and implicit-language processing).

Methods A national prospective population-based cohort study over 25 months. Newly diagnosed PTCS cases notified via British Paediatric Surveillance Unit were ascertained using classical diagnostic criteria and categorised according to 2013 revised diagnostic criteria. We derived national age, sex and weight-specific annual incidence rates and assessed effects of sex and weight categories. Results We identified 185 PTCS cases of which 166 also fulfilled revised diagnostic criteria. The national annual incidence (95% CI) of PTCS in children aged 1-16 years was 0.71 (0.57 to 0.87) per 100 000 population increasing with age and weight to 4.18 and 10.7 per 100 000 in obese boys and girls aged 12-15 years, respectively. Incidence rates under 7 years were similar in both sexes. From 7 years onwards, the incidence in girls was double that in boys, but only in overweight (including obese) children. In children aged 12-15 years, an estimated 82% of the incidence of PTCS was attributable to obesity. Two subgroups of PTCS were apparent: 168 (91%) cases aged from 7 years frequently presented on medication and with headache and were predominantly female and obese. The remaining 17 (9%) cases under 7 years often lacked these risk factors and commonly presented with paralytic squint. Conclusions This uniquely large population-based study of childhood PTCS will inform the design of future intervention studies.

"Mayor, J.; Plunkett, K.",2010,databases,A Neurocomputational Account of Taxonomic Responding and Fast Mapping in Early Word Learning,Psychological Review,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0018130,"We present a neurocomputational model with self-organizing maps that accounts for the emergence of taxonomic responding and fast mapping in early word learning, as well as a rapid increase in the rate of acquisition of words observed in late infancy. The quality and efficiency of generalization of word-object associations is directly related to the quality of prelexical, categorical representations in the model. We show how synaptogenesis supports coherent generalization of word-object associations and show that later synaptic pruning minimizes metabolic costs without being detrimental to word learning. The role played by joint-attentional activities is identified in the model, both at the level of selecting efficient cross-modal synapses and at the behavioral level, by accelerating and refining overall vocabulary acquisition. The model can account for the qualitative shift in the way infants use words, from an associative to a referential-like use, for the pattern of overextension errors in production and comprehension observed during early childhood and typicality effects observed in lexical development. Interesting by-products of the model include a potential explanation of the shift from prototype to exemplar-based effects reported for adult category formation, an account of mispronunciation effects in early lexical development, and extendability to include accounts of individual differences in lexical development and specific disorders such as Williams syndrome. The model demonstrates how an established constraint on lexical learning, which has often been regarded as domain-specific, can emerge from domain-general learning principles that are simultaneously biologically, psychologically, and socially plausible. © 2010 American Psychological Association.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
"Mccandliss, Bruce Donald",1997,databases,Experience-based changes in cortical responses to written words,NaN,NaN,"Reading is a learned skill of obvious importance to society. Our ability to recognize written words has been investigated extensively through cognitive and neuroimaging studies. Such research has identified distinct brain regions related to processing the orthography of visual words and accessing the information associated with particular words. This thesis uses high density event related potential recordings (ERP) and reaction time methods to examine the acquisition of word reading abilities in adults and children. The first study used these methods to trace learning-related changes as undergraduates spent 50 hours learning a miniature artificial language (Keki). Keki words are somewhat irregular by the standards of English orthography, but possess English-like semantics. Behavioral measures indicate that learning Keki produced similar reaction time benefits shown for English words. Early portions of the ERP (around 200 msec) were sensitive to orthographic differences between English, Keki and consonant strings, but these effects were uninfluenced by learning Keki. Learning effects in later portions of the ERP related to semantic processing (around 300 msec) demonstrate that Keki words came to be processed much like English. A second study examined ten year old children reading English words. Behavioral responses demonstrated an influence of word familiarity and a smaller influence of orthographic regularity. Early portions of the ERP were influenced by familiarity, but orthographic influences on the ERP were much later than for the adults and showed a different topography. A third study with seven year olds showed no initial ERP influences due to the familiarity or the orthography of English words. Several hours spent learning new words via phonics or look-say instruction produced learning effects for trained words in reaction time measures and in later portions of the ERP, but these effects were not equivalent for the two instruction methods. Overall, these studies show the possibility of using ERPs to explore the details of the acquisition of word reading skills. For both adults and children, hours spent learning new words has a substantial impact on reaction times and ERPs, yet acquisition of the adult pattern of orthographic processing apparently requires extensive reading experience.

They are innovatively combining methods, introducing new measures, and demonstrating the use of technologies and measurement approaches that can inform the study of word learning and categorization, gaze, attention, gesture, and physiological functions. The book is laid out in four main sections (with an introduction and final chapter not within those sections). The first section of the book, 'Recognizing Patterns,' deals with infants' ability to recognize and generalize from patterns for linguistic and nonlinguistic input. In Section 2 of the book, 'From Patterns to Meaning,' the authors address how infant speech perception, social cognition, early conceptualization, and learning link to meaning and how all of this links to language learning itself. In Section 3, 'Predictors of Language Emergence,' the authors present detailed data to support their contentions that attention, gaze, and gesture, when deconstructed into measurable or observable components, can predict later language outcomes, rate of growth, or the emergence of new language abilities. In Section 4, 'Models and Methods to Study Language,' Patricia Kuhl presents her own model, the Native Language Model; Leslie Cohen and Jason Brunt address methodological approaches in general; and Gary Marcus and Hugh Rabagliatti bring us up to date on statistical modeling; each chapter uses the work of the authors' own laboratory teams to instantiate the discussion with real data. Finally, Lisa Freund discusses neuroimaging tools that can now or may soon in the future be usable with infants and young children. Those who work in infant language and cognition must not only be aware of the work that is being done using paradigms and methodologies other than their own; they must also consider with an open mind the possibility that these other theories could play a role in their own work. We must embrace the excitement of intellectual debate and infuse it with data.

Previous studies of mTBI assessed at 1 week or less post-injury have produced inconsistent results, spanning reports of no ill effects to findings of robust dysfunction. These gross disparities reflect study differences such as the criteria for mTBI diagnosis and selection of comparison groups. In consideration of these issues, this study investigated outcome in the first 96 hours after injury in adolescents and adults ages 12-30 years with mTBI (n=73) compared with orthopedically injured (OI, n=65) and typically developing controls (TDC, n=40). The mTBI group reported significantly greater general psychological distress, post-concussion symptom severity, and post-traumatic stress severity than OI (all p<0.0001) and TDC (all p<0.0001); the OI and TDC groups responded similarly on these variables. There was a significant Group×Age interaction on the Total score (p<0.009), and the Cognitive (p=0.01) and Somatic (p<0.032) subscales of the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire where increasing symptom severity was associated with increasing age in the mTBI group. On neuropsychological assessment, the mTBI group performed significantly more poorly compared with OI for Verbal Selective Reminding Test (delayed recall, p=0.0003) and Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (SDMT written p=0.03; oral, p=0.001). The TDC group more robustly outperformed the mTBI group on these measures and also on the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (delayed recall, p<0.04), Letter Fluency (p<0.02), and Category Switching (p<0.04). The TDC group outperformed the OI group on SDMT and Letter Fluency. These findings are consistent with previous reports of acute deficits in episodic memory and processing speed acutely after mTBI. Notably, however, these data also demonstrate the challenges of comparison group selection because differences were also found between the TDC and OI groups. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,30,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Behavioral and neuroimaging studies have found that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) evidence abnormalities in semantic processing, with particular difficulties in verbal comprehension. However, it is not known whether these semantic deficits are confined to the verbal domain or represent a more general problem with semantic processing. The focus of the current study was to investigate verbal and meaningful nonverbal semantic processing in high-functioning children with autism (mean age = 5.8 years) using event-related potentials (ERPs). Method: ERPs were recorded while children attended to semantically matching and mismatching picture-word and picture-environmental sound pairs. Results: ERPs of typically developing children exhibited evidence of semantic incongruency detection in both the word and environmental sound conditions, as indexed by elicitation of an N400 effect. In contrast, children with ASD showed an N400 effect in the environmental sound condition but not in the word condition. Conclusions: These results provide evidence for a deficiency in the automatic activation of semantic representations in children with ASD, and suggest that this deficit is somewhat more selective to, or more severe in, the verbal than the nonverbal domain. © 2009 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,6,7,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Short lists (16 words/list), consisting of visually-presented semantically-related words (bed, rest) or rhyming words (weep, beep) were presented rapidly to subjects, who were asked to attend to the relations among the words. Regions preferentially involved in attention to semantic relations appeared within left anterior/ventral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, approximate Brodmann Area, BA47), left posterior/dorsal IFG (BA44/45), left superior/middle temporal cortex (BA22/21), left fusiform gyrus (BA37), and right cerebellum. Regions preferentially involved in attention to phonological relations appeared within left inferior frontal cortex (near BA6/44, posterior to the semantic regions within IFG described above) and within bilateral inferior parietal cortex (BA40) and precuneus (BA7). This method is notable in that a comparison of the two tasks within some of the individual subjects revealed activation patterns similar to the group average, especially within left inferior frontal and left superior/middle parietal cortices. This fact combined with the efficiency with which the data can be obtained (here, in about an hour of functional scanning) and the adaptability of the task for many different subject populations suggests a wide range of possibilities for this technique: it could be used to track language development (e.g. in children), compare language organization across subject populations (e.g. for dyslexic or blind subjects), and identify language regions within individuals (e.g. potentially to aid in surgical planning). © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this study, we use advanced multimodal imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography; MEG) to investigate the spatiotemporal profile of repetition priming. We use intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) to validate our fMRI/MEG measurements. Twelve controls completed a semantic judgment task with fMRI and MEG that included words presented once (new, 'N') and words that repeated (old, 'O'). Six patients with epilepsy completed the same task during iEEG recordings. Blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses for N vs. O words were examined across the cortical surface and within regions of interest. MEG waveforms for N vs. O words were estimated using a noise-normalized minimum norm solution, and used to interpret the timecourse of fMRI. Spatial concordance was observed between fMRI and MEG repetition effects from 350 to 450. ms within bilateral occipitotemporal and medial temporal, left prefrontal, and left posterior temporal cortex. Additionally, MEG revealed widespread sources within left temporoparietal regions, whereas fMRI revealed bilateral reductions in occipitotemporal and left superior frontal, and increases in inferior parietal, precuneus, and dorsolateral prefrontal activity. BOLD suppression in left posterior temporal, left inferior prefrontal, and right occipitotemporal cortex correlated with MEG repetition-related reductions. IEEG responses from all three regions supported the timecourse of MEG and localization of fMRI. Furthermore, iEEG decreases to repeated words were associated with decreased gamma power in several regions, providing evidence that gamma oscillations are tightly coupled to cognitive phenomena and reflect regional activations seen in the BOLD signal. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,36,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In the present paper, we report an adult case of MSUD with associated neurocognitive deficits and functional limitations following liver transplantation. Neuroimaging revealed no structural abnormalities, while the results from the neuropsychological evaluation showed impairment in visual-spatial processing, attention, executive functioning, and psychomotor abilities, with relative strengths in verbal skills.

Previous studies have addressed this issue by contrasting tasks involving semantic and phonological decisions. However, these tasks engage verbal short-term memory and executive functions that are not required for reading and naming. Here, 20 subjects were instructed to overtly name written words and pictures of objects while their neuronal responses were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Each trial consisted of a pair of successive stimuli that were either semantically related (e.g., ""ROBIN-nest""), phonologically related (e.g., ""BELL-belt""), unrelated (e.g., ""KITE-lobster""), or semantically and phonologically identical (e.g., ""FRIDGE-fridge""). In addition, a pair of stimuli could be presented in either the same modality (word-word or picture-picture) or a different modality (word-picture or picture-word). We report that semantically related pairs modulate neuronal responses in a left-lateralized network, including the pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus, the angular gyrus, and the superior frontal gyrus. We propose that these areas are involved in stimulus-driven semantic processes. In contrast, phonologically related pairs modulate neuronal responses in bilateral insula. This region is therefore implicated in the discrimination of similar, competing phonological and articulatory codes. The above effects were detected with both words and pictures and did not differ between the two modalities even with a less conservative statistical threshold. In conclusion, this study dissociates the effects of semantic and phonological relatedness between successive items during reading and naming aloud. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,26,36,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Mounting evidence suggests that executive function in adults may be driven by dynamic control of neurophysiological processes. Yet, how these dynamics evolve over adolescence and contribute to cognitive development is unknown. In a sample of 780 youth aged 8–22 yr (42.7% male) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopment Cohort, we use a dynamic graph approach to extract activation states in BOLD fMRI data from 264 brain regions. We construct a graph in which each observation in time is a node and the similarity in brain states at two different times is an edge. Using this graphical approach, we identify two primary brain states reminiscent of intrinsic and task-evoked systems. We show that time spent in these two states is higher in older adolescents, as is the flexibility with which the brain switches between them. Increasing time spent in primary states and flexibility among states relates to increases in a complex executive accuracy factor score over adolescence. Flexibility is more positively associated with accuracy toward early adulthood. These findings suggest that brain state dynamics are associated with complex executive function across a critical period of adolescence. © 2017",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,15.6,21,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Participants were visually presented with sentences, word-by-word, and were asked to judge whether the sentences were semantically acceptable. The crucial manipulation was on the sentence-final two-character compound words, which were either correct or incorrect. For the incorrect compounds, the second characters of the base words were replaced by homophonic or orthographically similar characters. ERP results showed that, across participant groups, the peak of P200 appeared earlier for the homophonic condition than for the orthographic and the baseline conditions. Importantly, for both child and adult readers, relative to the baseline, both orthographic mismatch in the homophonic condition and phonological mismatch in the orthographic condition elicited N400 effects. While for adults these effects appeared to be equal in size, the peak of the N400 component appeared earlier for orthographic mismatch than for phonological mismatch. For children the N400 effect was larger for orthographic mismatch than for phonological mismatch. The N400 component was also more negative for children than for adults in the homophonic condition, and its peak appeared later for children than for adults in the homophonic and the baseline conditions. Moreover, the offset of the N400 effects appeared earlier for adults than for children and for orthographic mismatch than for phonological mismatch. These findings suggest that both Chinese adult readers and school children rely more on orthographic information than on phonological information to access lexical semantics in reading Chinese sentences. However, the differential effects between orthography and phonology may have different ERP manifestations in adults and children. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Neurodevelopmental assessments demonstrated significant differences in full-scale, verbal, and performance intelligence quotient, as well as Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores, between the preterm and term control subjects. Rates of perinatal complications did not differ significantly across preterm treatment groups, but male preterm subjects randomly assigned to saline tended to have lower Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised scores than did all of the other preterm groups. During phonological processing, a significant treatment-by-gender effect was demonstrated in 3 brain regions: the left inferior parietal lobule, the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area), and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate a differential effect of indomethacin administration early in postnatal life on the subsequent development of neural systems that subserve language functioning in these male and female preterm infants.

Study design: Subjects who were born prematurely (n = 14; 600-1250 g birthweight) without neonatal brain injury and 10 matched term control subjects were examined with a fMRI passive listening task of language, the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF) and portions of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP). The fMRI task was evaluated for both phonologic and semantic processing. Results: Although there were differences in CELF scores between the subjects born prematurely and control subjects, there were no significant differences in the CTOPP measures in the 2 groups. fMRI studies demonstrated that the groups differentially engaged neural systems known to process language. Children born at term were significantly more likely to activate systems for the semantic processing of language, whereas subjects born prematurely preferentially engaged regions that subserve phonology. Conclusions: At 12 years of age, children born prematurely and children born at term activate neural systems for the auditory processing of language differently. Subjects born prematurely engage different networks for phonologic processing; this strategy is associated with phonologic language scores that are similar to those of control subjects. These biologically based developmental strategies may provide the substrate for the improving language skills noted in children who are born prematurely. © 2006 Mosby, Inc.

Through the process of system-consolidation, the mnemonic binding role of the hippocampus is subsequently replaced by cortical hubs, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) or the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). Here, using BOLD-fMRI, we compared retrieval of semantic associations acquired through Fast Mapping (FM), an incidental, exclusion-based learning procedure, to retrieval of similar associations that were intentionally acquired through Explicit Encoding (EE). Despite an identical retrieval task, the encoding histories of the retrieved semantic associations (FM vs. EE) induced distinct neural substrates and disparate related neural dynamics in time. Retrieval of associations acquired through EE engaged the expected hippocampal and vmPFC related networks. Furthermore, retrieval intentionally encoded associations gave rise to a typical overnight increase in engagement of the vmPFC and increased vmPFC-hippocampal-neocortical functional connectivity. On the other hand, retrieval of associations acquired through FM immediately engaged an ATL related network that typically supports well-established semantic knowledge, a network that did not engage the hippocampus and the vmPFC. Moreover, FM learning was associated with minimal overnight changes in the BOLD responses and in the functional connectivity. Our findings indicate that FM may induce a direct, ATL-mediated acquisition and retention of novel arbitrary associations, bypassing the initial hippocampal-cortical representation phase. A direct, ATL-mediated vocabulary acquisition through FM could support the learning and retention of new associations in young children with presumably an immature hippocampal system, and possibly even in amnesic adults with hippocampal lesions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,23,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Some researchers question the justification for diagnosing and treating pediatric anxiety disorders, owing to concerns about the inappropriate medicalization of social problems. Others note the importance of diagnosis and treatment, given that pediatric anxiety disorders represent a strong risk factor for serious adult mental disorders. We examine the neural correlates of pediatric anxiety disorders, to consider the validity of the categorization scheme used in recent treatment studies. Methods: Using inclusion criteria derived from recent treatment trials, we compared gray matter volume throughout the brain in children with and without anxiety. Morphometric analyses used optimized voxel-based morphometry, an automated method for examining structural changes throughout the brain. Results: Reductions in left amygdala gray matter volume were noted for patients with anxiety disorders relative to comparison subjects.

Because only relative durational information distinguishes this particular vowel contrast, both first and second language learners have difficulties in acquiring this phonemically crucial durational difference. Previous cross-linguistic studies conducted on adults showed that phoneme-specific, left-dominant neural responses were observed only for native Japanese listeners. Using the same stimuli, we show that a larger response to the across-category changes than to the within-category changes occurred transiently in the 6- to 7-month-old group before stabilizing in the groups older than 12 months. However, the left dominance of the phoneme-specific response in the auditory area was observed only in the groups of 13 months and above. Thus, the durational phonemic contrast is most likely processed first by a generic auditory circuit at 6-7 months as a result of early auditory experience. The neural processing of the contrast is then switched over to a more linguistic circuit after 12 months, this time with a left dominance similar to native adult listeners.

"Minturn, J.E.; Fisher, M.J.",2013,databases,Gliomas in children,Current Treatment Options in Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11940-013-0225-x,"Opinion statement: Gliomas are the most common brain tumor in children and represent nearly 50 % of all pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors. They are a heterogeneous group of diseases, ranging from highly malignant and frequently fatal to histologically benign and curable by surgery alone. A uniform treatment approach to these tumors is not practical, due to their histological and biological heterogeneity. Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are best treated with maximally safe surgical resection, generally achievable for hemispheric or cerebellar locations. Patients with deep midline, optic pathway/hypothalamic, and brain stem locations should undergo subtotal resection or biopsy only. If a complete resection is not feasible, subtotal resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy is the standard approach; however, observation alone with serial neuroimaging is used in some asymptomatic, surgically inaccessible lesions. Chemotherapy is used first-line in cases of residual or progressive disease, to avoid or delay radiation therapy and its associated side effects. Regimens demonstrating objective responses and increased progression free survival (PFS) include carboplatin and vincristine (CV), thioguanine/procarbazine/CCNU/vincristine (TPCV), or weekly vinblastine. High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are less common in children than in adults, though are similar in their aggressive clinical behavior, resistance to therapy, and dismal outcomes. There is not a single ""standard of care"" therapy for non-metastatic HGGs, but generally accepted is an aggressive attempt at a complete surgical resection, followed by multimodality therapy with focal radiation and chemotherapy. The use of temozolomide (TMZ) during and following radiotherapy is common, though it appeared not to improve the outcome in a cooperative group clinical trial when compared to an historical control cohort. The angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab, used alone or in combination with irinotecan, is also commonly used as maintenance therapy after radiation. Current trials are prospectively comparing TMZ to newer agents (vorinostat, bevacizumab) in a randomized phase II trial. Brainstem gliomas are a unique category of childhood gliomas. Approximately 80 % of childhood brainstem gliomas arise within the pons as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG). When biopsied, these are usually HGGs and carry a dismal prognosis. Standard therapy is focal radiation (54-58 Gy), preferably on a clinical trial testing concurrent chemotherapy or biologic agent. No standard chemotherapy agent has impacted survival. The remaining 20 % of brainstem gliomas are low-grade, arise in the midbrain, dorsal medulla, or cervicomedullary junction, and are indolent in nature with a much better prognosis. Improvement in the outcome of all childhood gliomas will require increased knowledge of the underlying biology of these tumors, in order to treat with more biologically based and precise therapies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a crucial area engaged in this ability. Cognitive training has been demonstrated to improve episodic memory in adults and older subjects. However, there are no studies examining the effects of cognitive training on episodic memory encoding in typically developing children and adolescents. This study investigated the behavioral effects and neural correlates of semantic categorization strategy training in children and adolescents during verbal episodic memory encoding using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants with age range: 7–18 years were scanned before and after semantic categorization training during encoding of word lists. Results showed improved memory performance in adolescents, but not in children. Deactivation of the anterior medial PFC/anterior cingulate and higher activation of the right anterior and lateral orbital gyri, right frontal pole and right middle frontal gyrus activation were found after training in adolescents when compared to children.

IONM allows intraoperative detection of neurological insults to the spinal cord and enables surgeons to react in real time. IONM failure rates can reach 61% in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). Factors decreasing the quality of IONM signals or making IONM impossible in CP patients undergoing scoliosis correction have not been well described. Methods: We categorized IONM data from 206 children with CP who underwent surgical scoliosis correction at a single institution from 2002 through 2013 into 3 groups: (1) ""no signals,"" if neither somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) nor transcranial motor-evoked potentials (TcMEP) could be obtained; (2) ""no sensory,"" if no interpretable SSEP were obtained regardless of interpretable TcMEP; and (3) ""no motor,"" if no interpretable TcMEP were obtained regardless of interpretable SSEP. We analyzed preexisting neuroimaging, available for 93 patients, and neurological status of the full cohort against these categories. Statistical analysis of univariate and multivariate associations was performed using logistic regression. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with significance set at P<0.05. Results: Multivariate analysis showed significant associations of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), hydrocephalus, and encephalomalacia with lack of meaningful and interpretable signals. Focal PVL (Fig. 1) was associated with no motor (OR=39.95; P=0.04). Moderate hydrocephalus was associated with no signals (OR=32.35; P<0.01), no motor (OR=10.14; P=0.04), and no sensory (OR=8.44; P=0.03). Marked hydrocephalus (Fig. 2) was associated with no motor (OR=20.46; P<0.01) and no signals (OR=8.83; P=0.01). Finally, encephalomalacia (Fig. 3) was associated with no motor (OR=6.99; P=0.01) and no signals (OR=4.26; P=0.03).

In line with this pattern of activation–lesion overlap, patients did not differ from matched healthy controls (N = 10) in predictability-related activations. However, whereas controls showed increased activation in bilateral auditory cortex and parietal operculum when silently reading familiar words relative to viewing letter strings, this effect was absent in the patients.

Simultaneous-bilinguals, sequential-bilinguals and monolingual, male and female 10-13 years old children participated in this longitudinal study over a period of two years.

Headaches are divided into primary and secondary categories. Migraine and tension type headaches are prototype of primary headaches without underlying pathology. On the other hand, the type of headache which stems from organic diseases such as: brain tumor, increased intracranial pressure, systemic disease, drug toxicity, ear-nose and throat problems are considered secondary. On the whole, the majority of children with primary headache have two patterns of headache. One is a chronic low-grade and the other is an intermittent disabling headache. The cause of the former is either caffeine or analgesic abuse, and the latter is predominantly migraine. Traditionally, if a child presents himself with chief complain of headache, care taker physician begins with history taking followed by thorough physical and neurological examinations.

ADHD with and without RD consistently have higher inattentive ratings compared with typically developing controls, with co-occurring ADHD and RD also demonstrating impaired phonological processing. Accordingly, inattention has been associated with greater phonological impairment, though the neural correlates of the association are poorly understood from a functional neuroimaging perspective. It was postulated that only the co-occurring subgroup would demonstrate hypoactivation of posterior, left hemispheric, reading-related areas and, to a lesser extent, alterations in right hemispheric, attention areas compared with controls. Methods: A novel word rhyming Continuous Performance Task assesses functional activation differences in phonology- and attention-related areas between three groups: ten boys with ADHD and RD, fourteen boys with ADHD without RD, and fourteen typically developing controls. Subjects respond to words that rhyme with a target word as mono- and disyllabic, English words are visually presented over 90. s blocks. Results: Behavioral performance was not different between groups. Some hypoactivation of left hemispheric, reading-related areas was apparent in ADHD and RD, but not ADHD without RD, compared with controls. Right hemispheric, attention areas showed alterations in both ADHD subgroups relative to controls; however, the differences for each subgroup were dissimilar.

To elucidate the relationship between p53 abnormality and invasiveness of the tumors, we studied mutation and protein expression of p53 in 48 consecutive patients with malignant astrocytoma (14 anaplastic astrocytomas and 34 glioblastoma multiformes). The tumors were classified into three categories according to the features of magnetic resonance imaging, and 5, 7, and 36 tumors were classified into diffuse, multiple, and single type, respectively. We then examined how these tumor types correlate with MIB-1 staining index, TP53 gene mutation, and p53 protein expression. We found that p53 immunopositivity or TP53 mutation was frequently observed in diffuse and multiple types. These abnormalities of p53 were also associated with high MIB-1 staining index and strong expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. Furthermore, diffuse- and multiple-type tumors were significantly correlated with poor progression-free survival, whereas only multiple-type tumors were significantly correlated with poor overall survival. As diffuse and multiple features on imaging modalities represent invasive characteristics of the tumors, p53 abnormalities may affect the invasive and aggressive nature of malignant astrocytomas. © 2010 Japan Soceity of BrainTumor Pathology.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,57.5,83,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The advantage in this task was attributed to the greater executive control of bilinguals, but this impact on linguistic processing has not been demonstrated in adults. Here, we recorded event-related potentials in young adults who were either English monolinguals or bilinguals as they performed two different language judgment tasks. In the acceptability task, participants indicated whether or not the sentence contained an error in either grammar or meaning; in the grammaticality task, participants indicated only whether the sentence contained an error in grammar, in spite of possible conflicting information from meaning. In both groups, sentence violations generated N400 and P600 waves. In the acceptability task, bilinguals were less accurate than monolinguals, but in the grammaticality task which requires more executive control, bilingual and monolingual groups showed a comparable level of accuracy. Importantly, bilinguals generated smaller P600 amplitude and a more bilateral distribution of activation than monolinguals in the grammaticality task requiring more executive control. Our results show that bilinguals use their enhanced executive control for linguistic processing involving conflict in spite of no apparent advantage in linguistic processing under simpler conditions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,23.5,33,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The transverse patterning (TP) task is dependent upon the integrity of the hippocampal system, however, we previously demonstrated successful TP following hippocampal damage using meaningful stimuli and relations (Moses, S.N., Ostreicher, M.L., Rosenbaum, R.S., Ryan, J.D., 2008. Successful transverse patterning in amnesia using semantic knowledge. Hippocampus 18, 121–124). Here, we used magnetoencephalgraphy (MEG) to directly observe the neural underpinnings of TP, and the changes that occur as stimuli and relations become more meaningful. In order to optimize our ability to detect signal from deep, non-dominant, brain sources we implemented the event-related synthetic aperture magnetometry minimum-variance beamformer algorithm (ER-SAM; Cheyne, D., Bakhtazad, L., Gaetz, W., 2006. Spatiotemporal mapping of cortical activity accompanying voluntary movements using an event-related beamforming approach. Human Brain Mapping 27, 213–229) coupled with the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate statistical approach (McIntosh, A.R., Bookstein, F.L., Haxby, J.V., Grady, C.L., 1996.

Partial least squares analysis of neuroimaging data: Applications and advances. NeuroImage 23, S250–S263). We found that increased meaningfulness elicited reduced bilateral hippocampal activation, along with increased activation of left prefrontal and temporal cortical structures, including inferior frontal (IFG), as well as anterior temporal and perirhinal cortices. These activation patterns may represent a shift towards reliance upon existing semantic knowledge. This shift likely permits successful TP performance with meaningful stimuli and relations following hippocampal damage.

Despite considered typical of children for a long time, the persistence of ADHD symptoms in adulthood gained increasing interest during the last decades. Indeed, its diagnosis, albeit controversial, is rarely carried out even because ADHD is often comorbid with several other psychiatric diosrders, in particular with bipolar disorders (BDs), a condition that complicates the clinical picture, assessment and treatment. Aims: The aim of this paper was to systematically review the scientific literature on the neurobiological, clinical features and current pharmacological management of ADHD comorbid with BDs across the entire lifespan, with a major focus on the adulthood. Discussion: The pharmacology of ADHD-BD in adults is still empirical and influenced by the individual experience of the clinicians. Stimulants are endowed of a prompt efficacy and safety, whilst non-stimulants are useful when a substance abuse history is detected, although they require some weeks in order to be fully effective. In any case, an in-depth diagnostic and clinical evaluation of the single individual is mandatory. Conclusion: The comorbidity of ADHD with BD is still a controversial matter, as it is the notion of adult ADHD as a distinct nosological category. Indeed, some findings highlighted the presence of common neurobiological mechanisms and overlapping clinical features, although disagreement does exist. In any case, while expecting to disentangle this crucial question, a correct management of this comorbidity is essential, which requires the co-administration of mood stabilizers. Further controlled clinical studies in large samples of adult ADHD-BD patients appear extremely urgent in order to better define possible therapeutic guidelines, as well as alternative approaches for this potentially invalidating condition. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Experiment 1 found that the type of agent, but not the type of effect, influenced children's production of causal language. Children produced more causal language for intentionally caused events than for either unintentionally- or object-caused events, independent of the type of effect. Experiment 2, which tested children's judgments of descriptions for the events, found a similar pattern. Children preferred causal descriptions more for the intentionally caused events than the unintentionally- and the object-caused events. Experiment 3 found no evidence of bias in children's non-linguistic representations of the events. Taken together, these results suggest an intention-to-CAUSE bias in children's mapping of conceptual representations of causality into linguistic structure.

In doing so, we concentrate primarily on the first postnatal year because it is within this time window that the most dramatic shifts in scientific opinion have occurred. Moreover, this time frame includes the critical age (∼9 months) at which human infants purportedly first begin to demonstrate rudimentary hippocampal-dependent memory. We review the evidence for and against this assertion, note the lack of direct neurocognitive data speaking to this issue, and question how demonstrations of exuberant relational learning and memory in infants as young as 3-months old can be accommodated within extant models. Finally, we discuss whether current impasses in the infant memory literature could be leveraged by making greater use of neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which have been deployed so successfully in adults. © 2014 The Authors.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

By contrast, patients with developmental amnesia (DA), where hippocampal damage was acquired early in life, have preserved performance on this task, although the reason for this sparing is unclear. One possibility is that residual function in remnant hippocampal tissue is sufficient to support basic scene construction in DA. Such a situation was found in the one amnesic patient with adult-acquired hippocampal damage (P01) who could also construct scenes. Alternatively, DA patients’ scene construction might not depend on the hippocampus, perhaps being instead reliant on non-hippocampal regions and mediated by semantic knowledge. To adjudicate between these two possibilities, we examined scene construction during functional MRI (fMRI) in Jon, a well-characterised patient with DA who has previously been shown to have preserved scene construction. We found that when Jon constructed scenes he activated many of the regions known to be associated with imagining scenes in control participants including ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, retrosplenial and posterior parietal cortices. Critically, however, activity was not increased in Jon's remnant hippocampal tissue. Direct comparisons with a group of control participants and patient P01, confirmed that they activated their right hippocampus more than Jon. Our results show that a type of non-hippocampal dependent scene construction is possible and occurs in DA, perhaps mediated by semantic memory, which does not appear to involve the vivid visualisation of imagined scenes.

Although there is a strong genetic contribution, non-inherited factors are also important. Children with ADHD can underperform on IQ tests. They also show deficits on measures of executive function, response inhibition, prefrontal cortical function, delay aversion and timing deficits. Structural imaging studies show alterations, including reduced volume, in the basal ganglia and limbic regions of the brain, and delayed cortical maturation especially in the prefrontal regions; functional magnetic resonance imaging studies implicate corticostriatal circuit involvement and alterations in networks considered relevant to attention and executive function.

However, no study to date, has taken advantage of this strength in visuospatial processing to improve language comprehension difficulties in ASD. This study used a translational neuroimaging approach to test the role of a visual imagery-based reading intervention in improving the brain circuitry underlying language processing in children with ASD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in a longitudinal study design, was used to investigate intervention-related change in sentence comprehension, brain activation, and functional connectivity in three groups of participants (age 8–13 years): an experimental group of ASD children (ASD-EXP), a wait-list control group of ASD children (ASD-WLC), and a group of typically developing control children. After intervention, the ASD-EXP group showed significant increase in activity in visual and language areas and right-hemisphere language area homologues, putamen, and thalamus, suggestive of compensatory routes to increase proficiency in reading comprehension. Additionally, ASD children who had the most improvement in reading comprehension after intervention showed greater functional connectivity between left-hemisphere language areas, the middle temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus while reading high imagery sentences. Thus, the findings of this study, which support the principles of dual coding theory [Paivio 2007], suggest the potential of a strength-based reading intervention in changing brain responses and facilitating better reading comprehension in ASD children.

The aim of this study was to explore associations between white matter microstructure and language domains of semantics, grammar and phonological awareness at 7-years of age on a whole-brain level and within the arcuate fasciculus, an important language pathway, in very preterm and term-born children. Language was assessed in 145 very preterm-born (<30 weeks’ gestation and/or <1250 g birth weight) and 33 term-born children aged 7 years. Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), mean diffusivity (MD), axon orientation dispersion and axon density were estimated from diffusion magnetic resonance images also obtained at 7 years. The correlation between diffusion values and language was assessed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). The arcuate fasciculus was delineated using constrained spherical deconvolution tractography and diffusion parameters from this tract were related to language measures using linear regression. While there was evidence for widespread associations between white matter microstructure and language, there was little evidence of differences in these associations between very preterm and term-born groups. TBSS analyses revealed that higher FA and lower AD, RD, and MD in major fibre tracts, including those subserving language, were associated with better semantic, grammar and phonological awareness performance. Higher axon density in widespread fibre tracts was also associated with better semantic performance. The tractography analyses of the arcuate fasciculus showed some evidence for associations between white matter microstructure and language outcomes. White matter microstructural organisation in widespread fibre tracts, including language-relevant pathways, was associated with language performance in whole-brain and tract-based analyses. The associations were similar for very preterm and term-born groups, despite very preterm children performing more poorly across language domains. © 2018 The Authors",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,7.6,7,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Methods: Data concerning 2,531 patients with epilepsy seen between January 1989 and June 1994 were analyzed using the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification. Results: Of 2,531 cases, 48% fell into ILAE categories 1.3, 3.2, or 4.1 (cryptogenic, without unequivocal generalized or focal seizures; or situation-related seizures, respectively). Localization-related epilepsies (LREs) and epileptic syndromes (1.1, 1.2, 1.3) were found in 1,591 (62.9%) patients; of these patients, symptomatic localization-related epilepsies totaled 62.7%, and idiopathic localization-related epilepsies accounted for only 0.7%. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy was the most common type of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), comprising 4.9% of the total study population and 7.7% of patients registered in the epilepsy clinic. A combination of childhood and juvenile absence epilepsies were found in only 0.4% of the total study population. Single computed tomography (CT) enhancing lesion (SCTEL) and focal cerebral calcification (FCC) accounted for 22% of the etiologic factors for localization-related epilepsies. Neurologic deficits were found in 9.5% of patients with SCTEL; none were found with FCC. None of the patients with these lesions had any history of antecedent events that suggested CNS involvement. In patients with localization-related epilepsies with unremarkable clinical data, the proportion of CT scans showing SCTELs was 39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.43) and 0.18 (95% CI, 15-0.21) for FCCs. The proportion for both lesions together was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.53-0.61). Seizures did not recur once the lesion resolved in patients with SCTELs. In patients with FCCs, seizure remission was 71.5% (95% CI, 53.7-85.4) at 3 years. Conclusions: This study illustrates the rarity in one patient population of some of the syndromes and categories described in the ILAE classification. Childhood and juvenile absence epilepsies together formed a small proportion. SCTEL and FCC were important etiologic factors for localization related epilepsies. The epilepsy associated with SCTEL was a form of benign epilepsy; epilepsy associated with FCC had remission rates similar to other remote symptomatic epilepsies. Without neuroimaging evidence, these 2 lesions would have been missed and the patients might have been grouped under cryptogenic localization related epilepsy. For this reason, we emphasize the need for neuroimaging in patients with localization related epilepsies with unremarkable clinical findings, before classification into the cryptogenic category. In the absence of neuroimaging, such patients should be classified as 'probably cryptogenic'.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Failure to identify this subset of patients and adjust the surgical plan accordingly results in suboptimum surgical outcomes. There are unique technical challenges associated with obtaining recordings from the STP. The authors sought to examine the clinical utility and safety of placing depth electrodes within the STP in patients with TLE. METHODS This study is a retrospective review and analysis of all cases in which patients underwent intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) with use of at least one STP depth electrode over the 10 years from January 2006 through December 2015 at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Basic clinical information was collected, including the presence of ictal auditory symptoms, electrode coverage, monitoring results, resection extent, outcomes, and complications. Additionally, cases in which the temporal lobe was primarily or secondarily involved in seizure onset and propagation were categorized based upon how rapidly epileptic activity was observed within the STP following seizure onsets: within 1 second, between 1 and 15 seconds, after 15 seconds, and not involved. RESULTS Fifty-two patients underwent iEEG with STP coverage, with 1 STP electrode used in 45 (86.5%) cases and 2 STP electrodes in the other cases. There were no complications related to STP electrode placement. Of 42 cases in which the temporal lobe was primarily or secondarily involved, seizure activity was recorded from the STP in 36 cases (85.7%): in 5 cases (11.9%) within 1 second, in 5 (11.9%) between 1 and 15 seconds, and in 26 (61.9%) more than 15 seconds following seizure onset. Seizure outcomes inversely correlated with rapid ictal involvement of the STP (Engel class I achieved in 25%, 67%, and 82% of patients in the above categories, respectively). All patients without ictal STP involvement achieved seizure freedom. Only 4 (11.1%) patients with STP ictal involvement reported auditory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Ictal involvement of the STP is common even in the absence of auditory symptoms and can be effectively detected by the STP electrodes.

The electroencephalography (EEG) background has been shown to be an excellent predictor of outcome by most studies, with a few suggesting limited value in prognostication. Previous studies suggest poor prognosis with severely abnormal backgrounds, but prediction was difficult with moderate abnormalities. The proposed numerical scoring system for the EEG background provides an objective method of evaluation with improved reproducibility, categorization, and prognostication. Our study showed that the numerical score of EEG background was a good predictor of outcome. Higher numerical scores reflecting greater abnormality of background EEG were associated with increasing incidence of mortality, neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing impairment, and epilepsy. The numerical score also correlated with neuroimaging abnormalities. A numerical EEG score can help target interventional strategies for neonatal seizures.

The category of  intracranial germ cell tumors is divided into pure germ cell tumors (GCTs) versus  nongerminomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). They are usually present in the second  decade of life with a male preponderance. We present here a rare case of  intracranial NGGCT in a 21-year-old Romanian male, who presented with complaints of  emesis, ataxic gait, and diplopia. A computed tomography scan of the head in the  emergency department revealed a pineal/suprapineal mass along with obstructive  hydrocephalus and dilated lateral and third ventricles without any bleeding. MRI of  the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine showed no evidence of leptomeningeal  metastasis. The patient had elevated serum markers of beta-hCG and AFP, which  pointed towards a diagnosis of nongerm cell tumor, as in pure GCTs, these markers  are normal. To relieve the obstruction from the mass effect, the patient had an  endoscopic third ventriculostomy (EVT). However, after the procedure, he developed  central diabetes insipidus as a complication with a triphasic response. Biopsy of  the mass revealed atypical cells with granular architecture and atypical glands with  positive immune histological markers for NGGCT. These findings supported the  diagnosis of mixed germ cell tumor with yolk sac carcinoma and seminoma components.  Patient's transient central diabetes resolved with normalization in his urine  output. He was eventually stabilized and returned to Romania for further management.  In summary, intracranial germ cell tumors are rare brain tumors that should be  distinguished based on histology and tumor markers as they will help in the guidance  of therapy.

The etiology of ICSDs likely involves a complex interplay among neurobiological, psychological and social risk factors. Neurobiological risk factors include the status of the neuroanatomical circuits that govern ICSDs. These circuits can be altered by disease, as well as exogenous influences such as centrally-acting pharmacologics. The ‘poster child’ for this scenario is Parkinson's disease (PD) medically managed by pharmacological treatments. PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that involves a gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons largely within nigrostriatal projections. Replacement therapy includes dopamine receptor agonists that directly activate postsynaptic dopamine receptors (bypassing the requirement for functioning presynaptic terminals). Some clinically useful dopamine agonists, e.g., pramipexole and ropinirole, exhibit high affinity for the D2/D3 receptor subtypes. These agonists provide excellent relief from PD motor symptoms, but some patients exhibit debilitating ICSD. Teasing out the neuropsychiatric contribution of PD-associated pathology from the drugs used to treat PD motor symptoms is challenging. In this review, we posit that modern clinical and preclinical research converge on the conclusion that dopamine replacement therapy can mediate addictions in PD and other neurological disorders. We provide five categories of evidences that align with this position: (i) ICSD prevalence is greater with D2/D3 receptor agonist therapy vs PD alone. (ii) Capacity of dopamine replacement therapy to produce addiction-like behaviors is independent of disease for which the therapy is being provided. (iii) ICSD-like behaviors are recapitulated in laboratory rats with and without PD-like pathology. (iv) Behavioral pathology co-varies with drug exposure.

A dramatic illustration of this multisensory integration is the McGurk effect, an illusion in which an auditory syllable is perceived differently when it is paired with an incongruent mouth movement. However, there are significant interindividual differences in McGurk perception: some children never perceive the illusion, while others always do. Because converging evidence suggests that the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) is a critical site for multisensory integration, we hypothesized that activity within the STS would predict susceptibility to the McGurk effect. To test this idea, we used BOLD fMRI in 17 children aged 6-12 years to measure brain responses to the following three audiovisual stimulus categories: McGurk incongruent, non-McGurk incongruent, and congruent syllables. Two separate analysis approaches, one using independent functional localizers and another using whole-brain voxel-based regression, showed differences in the left STS between perceivers and nonperceivers. The STS ofMcGurkperceivers responded significantlymorethan that of nonperceivers toMcGurk syllables, but not to other stimuli, and perceivers' hemodynamic responses in the STS were significantly prolonged. In addition to the STS, weaker differences between perceivers and nonperceivers were observed in the fusiform face area and extrastriate visual cortex. These results suggest that the STS is an important source of interindividual variability in children's audiovisual speech perception. ©2011 the authors.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,9.3,12,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Neuroimaging studies conducted with adults indicate that humor activates specific brain regions, including the temporo-occipito-parietal junction (TOPJ), involved in incongruity resolution, and mesolimbic regions, involved in reward processing. However, no study to date has used neuroimaging to examine humor in typically developing children. Here, we illuminate the neural network involved in the detection and appreciation of humor in childhood. Fifteen typically developing children (ages, 6-12 years) were invited to watch and respond to video clips while neural activity was imaged with a 3T GE Discovery MR750 scanner. Before presentation during functional imaging, the clips were evaluated by age-matched controls and were representative of three categories: Funny, Positive (enjoyable but not funny), and Neutral (not intended to evoke any emotional response). We found TOPJ and mesolimbic activation in children's response to humor, suggesting these regions may form a humor-essential neural network already present in childhood. Furthermore, in a novel comparison of Funny to Positive stimuli, we found that bilateral TOPJ activation may be specific to humor processing and not part of a general constellation of neural activity in response to reward. Finally, we observed greater activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and nucleus accumbens in younger participants, indicating humor activation intensity changes during development. By providing a crucial link in studying the neurodevelopment of humor processing across the lifespan, our findings contribute valuable information about the evolution of how children understand their world. © 2012 the authors.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,10,11,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We hypothesized that electroencephalography (EEG) synchrony and its temporal variability, analyzed during the acute phase following TBI, would be altered from that of normal children and as such would offer insights into TBI pathophysiology. Seventeen pediatric patients with mild to severe head injury admitted to a pediatric critical care unit were recruited along with 10 age- and gender-matched controls. Patients had two electroencephalographs performed 3 days apart. Outcome was measured at 1 year post-TBI utilizing the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score (PCPC).

The temporal variability of phase synchronization among EEG electrodes increased as patients recovered and emerged from coma (p < 0.001).

Comparisons of cerebral organization in normally hearing, monolingual English speakers with that observed in hearing and deaf late learners of English suggest that while systems important in lexical/semantic processing are relatively invulnerable to delays in exposure to a language, the development of systems important in grammatical processing, including the specialization of the left hemisphere, is affected by early language experience. Studies of individuals who acquired American Sign Language (ASL) as a native language suggest that similar systems within the left hemisphere are employed in processing all natural languages independently of the structure and modality of the language acquired. These studies also reveal that additional areas within the right hemisphere can be recruited into the language system when the language depends on the perception of spatial location and motion. Studies of children acquiring their first language reveal that there is increasing differentiation of the neural systems important in processing the meaning of words and of the areas important in lexical and grammatical processing and that these increases in specialization are linked to language abilities rather than to chronological age per se. Further studies suggest that developmental language impairment can result from alterations in one of several different systems important in language, and that some indices of these functional neural systems may be predictive of language impairment.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In this review, three significant strands of developmental action research are discussed. The first strand focuses on the relationship of diverse social cognitive processes, including the perception of goals and animacy, and the development of precursors to theory of mind, to action perception. The second investigates the role of motor resonance and mirror systems in early action development. The third strand focuses on the extraction of meaning from action by infants and discusses how semantic processing of action emerges early in life.

Dyslexia is an umbrella term for the various manifestations of  reading disabilities, each of which is related to its own complex of  neuropsychological dysfunctions, sometimes accompanied by neurological symptoms that  can be indicative of the specific location involved. Electro-physiology and  neuro-imaging in relation to metabolic activity have also confirmed that, to some  extent, there is dysfunction in various cerebral areas, more frequently in the left  than in the right hemisphere, less often between the hemispheres (corpus callosum)  and outside the classical language areas. The rather rare subtype referred to as  visual dyslexia and the inter-modal disconnection type resembling alexia are  eclipsed by dyslexias related to spoken language: the dysphonemic  (auditory-phonological) subtype and the subtypes that are concerned with the  production of speech (fluency, word-finding, syntax, sequences), semantics (language  comprehension) and linguistic memory. Although it is considered that there are basic  brain dysfunctions in dyslexics such as deficits in sequential information  processing, there is no ""grand unified theory"" of dyslexia. There are some new  insights as regards the aetiology. In addition to indications of such possible  causes as perinatal brain damage, genetic or chromosomal anomalies that manifest  themselves in the substrate in an unclear manner, there is also the possibility that  the cortical language areas can be disturbed in their development (migration  disorders and abnormal asymmetry) due to genetic or epigenetic hormonal and/or  immunological factors, so that the normal left hemispheric dominance does not  develop.

Higher brain signal variability has previously been linked with optimal behavioral performance. At present, little is known regarding the relationship between resting-state brain signal variability and ADHD symptom severity. The current study examined the relationship between a measure of moment-to-moment brain signal variability called mean-square successive difference (MSSD) and ADHD symptomatology in a group of children (7-12 years old) with (n = 40) and without (n = 30) a formal diagnosis of ADHD. A categorical analysis comparing subjects with and without a clinical diagnosis of ADHD showed no differences in MSSD between groups. A dimensional analysis revealed a positive relationship between MSSD and overall ADHD symptom severity and inattention across children with and without an ADHD diagnosis. Specifically, this positive relationship was found in medial prefrontal areas comprising the default mode network.

The impact of similar lesions sustained in infancy has not been established. Methods: We compared language outcomes in term-born individuals with confirmed neonatal stroke (n = 30, age = 7–18 years, left-sided lesions in 21 cases) to matched controls (n = 40). Injury to the dorsal and/or ventral language streams was assessed using T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tractography. Language lateralization was determined using functional MRI. Results: At the group level, left dorsal language stream injury was associated with selective speech repetition impairment for nonwords (p = 0.021) and sentences (p &lt; 0.0001). The majority of children with significant repetition impairment had retained left hemisphere language representation, but right hemisphere dominance was correlated with minimal or absent repetition deficits. Post hoc analysis of the repetition-impaired group revealed additional language-associated deficits, but these were more subtle and variable. Interpretation: We conclude that (1) despite the considerable plasticity of the infant brain, early dorsal language stream injury can result in specific and long-lasting problems with speech repetition that are similar to the syndrome of conduction aphasia seen in adults; and (2) language reorganization to the contralateral hemisphere has a protective effect.

The patients were also evaluated through MR Spectroscopy at baseline and after pharmacotherapy. The efficacy of the chosen therapy in correlation with the pharmacogenetic testing was evaluated through the mean change in the PANSS (Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale) total scores of the applied scales and through the change registered for the relevant neurobiological markers and MR (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) metabolites, from baseline till endpoint in different timepoints.

While many theories have attempted to explain the pattern of visual specialization within the ventral occipital and temporal areas, the biased connectivity hypothesis provides a framework which postulates extrinsic connectivity as a potential mechanism in shaping the development of category selectivity. As the posterior parietal cortex plays a central role in visual attention, we examined whether the pattern of parietal connectivity with the face and scene processing regions is closely linked with the functional properties of these two visually selective networks in a cohort of 60 children ages 9 to 12. Functionally localized face and scene selective regions were used in deriving each visual network's resting-state functional connectivity. The children's face and scene processing networks appeared to show a weak network segregation during resting state, which was confirmed when compared to that of a group of gender and handedness matched adults. Parietal regions of these children showed differential connectivity with the face and scene networks, and the extent of this differential parietal-visual connectivity predicted individual differences in the degree of segregation between the two visual networks, which in turn predicted individual differences in visual perception performance. Finally, the pattern of parietal connectivity with the face processing network also predicted the foci of face-related activation in the right fusiform gyrus across children. These findings provide evidence that extrinsic connectivity with regions such as the posterior parietal cortex may have important implications in the development of specialized visual processing networks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,10.2,12,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The present ERP study investigates the processing of phrase-structure violations in children below three years of age. Both children (mean age of 2.8 years) and adults passively listened to short active sentences that were either correct or syntactically incorrect. Adults displayed an ELAN that was followed by a P600 to the syntactic violation. Children also demonstrated a biphasic ERP pattern consisting of an early left hemispheric negativity and a late positivity. Both components, however, started later and persisted longer than those observed in adults.

This study aimed at developing optimal procedures for localizing interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) of patients with localization related epilepsy in the frontal lobe. To this end the localization results obtained for magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) were compared systematically using automated analysis procedures. Methods: Simultaneous recording of interictal EEG and MEG was successful for 18 out of the 24 patients studied. Visual inspection of these recordings revealed IEDs with varying morphology and topography. Cluster analysis was used to classify these discharges on the basis of their spatial distribution followed by equivalent dipole analysis of the cluster averages. The locations of the equivalent dipoles were compared with the location of the epileptogenic lesions of the patient or, if these were not visible at MRI with the location of the interictal onset zones identified by subdural electroencephalography. Results: Generally IEDs were more abundantly in MEG than in the EEG recordings. Furthermore, the duration of the MEG spikes, measured from the onset till the spike maximum, was in most patients shorter than the EEG spikes. In most patients, distinct spike subpopulations were found with clearly different topographical field maps. Cluster analysis of MEG spikes followed by dipole localization was successful (n = 14) for twice as many patients as for EEG source analysis (n = 7), indicating that the localizability of interictal MEG is much better than of interictal EEG. Conclusions: The automated procedures developed in this study provide a fast screening method for identifying the distinct categories of spikes and the brain areas responsible for these spikes. The results show that MEG spike yield and localization is superior compared with EEG.

Methods: Prospective study by semi-structured interview of 160 consecutive patients (117 female and 43 male) with video EEG confirmed diagnosis of PNES + epileptic seizures (ES). Results: Most parameters showed no significant differences. Males were, however, more likely to be unemployed (P=0.028), and females were six times more likely to self-harm (P=0.050), though the numbers were small in these categories. Men were more likely to attribute their PNES to a predisposing factor for epilepsy (P=0.001), and women were over eight times more likely to report sexual abuse (P=0.001). Event semiology was similar, but women were more likely to weep after events (P=0.017). The carers and family of men with PNES were three times less likely to accept the diagnosis of PNES (P=0.017). Conclusions: Our samples showed few significant gender differences, suggesting that other male and female populations of patients with PNES are likely to be similar also.

Design: Retrospective study. Setting: A 12-bed paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Patients: Children aged between 1 month and 18 years who had DW-MRI with ADC measurement within the first week following CA. Neurological outcomes were assessed using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale (PCPC). Differences between the favourable (PCPC ≤3) and unfavourable (PCPC ≥4) groups were analysed with regard to clinical data, electrophysiological patterns as well as qualitative and quantitative DW-MRI abnormalities. Results: Twenty children with a median age of 20 months (1.5-185) and a male/female sex ratio of 1.5 underwent DW-MRI after CA with a median delay of 3 days (1-7). Aetiologies of CA were (i) asphyxia (n = 10), (ii) haemodynamic (n = 5) or (iii) unknown (n = 5). With regard to DW-MRI findings, the unfavourable outcome group (n = 8) was associated with cerebral cortex (p = 0.02) and basal ganglia (p = 0.005) lesions, with a larger number of injured brain regions (p = 0.001) and a global decrease in measured ADC signal (p = 0.008).

Etiologic diagnosis is important for providing information about pathogenesis, prognosis, recurrence risk and specific medical interventions. The aim of this study was to determine the etiologic yield and spectrum of a consecutive cohort of global developmentally delayed children. Methods: This retrospective study included all children younger than 5 years of age with global developmental delay referred to a single university-based ambulatory pediatric neurology clinic for initial evaluation over a 14-month period from January 1997. Diagnostic studies consisted of history, physical examination, electroencephalography and selected investigations including neuroimaging, screening for metabolic disease, karyotype and fragile X testing. Results: In the study 247 patients (136 males) with a mean age of 24.2 ± 20.3 months were evaluated. Etiologic diagnosis was determined in 64 per cent of the patients classified under the following categories: perinatal complications (21 per cent), cerebral dysgenesis (18 per cent), chromosomal abnormalities (9 per cent), genetic/dysmorphic syndromes (3 per cent), metabolic disorders (4 per cent), hypothyroidism (4 per cent), neurocutaneous syndromes (3 per cent), intrauterine infection (2 per cent). Etiology was unknown in 36 per cent of the patients. Two laboratory tests (neuroimaging and cytogenetic analysis) together with the history and physical examination were most helpful in determining the etiologic diagnosis. Conclusion: This study suggests that optimal management of global developmentally delayed children and their family should involve a comprehensive evaluation. © The Author [2005].

Patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) are at high risk of developing schizophrenia and present similar cognitive impairments, including executive functions deficits. Thus, 22q11DS represents a model for the study of neural biomarkers associated with schizophrenia. In this study, we investigated structural and functional connectivity within and between the Default Mode (DMN), the Central Executive (CEN), and the Saliency network (SN) in 22q11DS using resting‐state fMRI and DTI. Furthermore, we investigated if triple network impairments were related to executive dysfunctions or the presence of psychotic symptoms. Sixty‐three patients with 22q11DS and sixty‐eighty controls (age 6–33 years) were included in the study. Structural connectivity between main nodes of DMN, CEN, and SN was computed using probabilistic tractography. Functional connectivity was computed as the partial correlation between the time courses extracted from each node. Structural and functional connectivity measures were then correlated to executive functions and psychotic symptom scores. Our results showed mainly reduced structural connectivity within the CEN, DMN, and SN, in patients with 22q11DS compared with controls as well as reduced between‐network connectivity. Functional connectivity appeared to be more preserved, with impairments being evident only within the DMN. Structural connectivity impairments were also related to executive dysfunctions. These findings show an association between triple network structural alterations and executive deficits in patients with the microdeletion, suggesting that 22q11DS and schizophrenia share common psychopathological mechanisms.

Several ERP and neuroimaging studies of second-language learners have found that neural organization for syntactic processing is sensitive to delays in secondlanguage acquisition. However, such delays in second-language acquisition are typically associated with lower language proficiency, rendering it difficult to assess whether differences in AOA or proficiency lead to these effects. Here we examined the effects of delayed second-language acquisition while controlling for proficiency differences by examining participants who differ in AOA but who were matched for proficiency in the same language. We compared the ERP response to auditory English phrase structure violations in a group of late learners of English matched for grammatical proficiency with a group of English native speakers. In the native speaker group, violations elicited a bilateral and prolonged anterior negativity, with onset at 100 msec, followed by a posterior positivity (P600). In contrast, in the nonnative speaker group, violations did not elicit the early anterior negativity, but did elicit a P600 which was more widespread spatially and temporally than that of the native speaker group. These results suggest that neural organization for syntactic processing is sensitive to delays in language acquisition independently of proficiency level. More specifically, they suggest that both early and later syntactic processes are sensitive to maturational constraints. These results also suggest that late learners who reach a high level of second-language proficiency rely on different neural mechanisms than native speakers of that language. © 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,25,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

This study explores relationships between white matter microstructure, assessed by fractional anisotropy (FA), and speed of cognitive processing using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). At 36 months after treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, 40 patients completed an MRI examination and neuropsychological evaluation. Patients were matched with healthy control subjects based on age, sex, and race. Individual FA values were extracted from examinations for all voxels identified as having significant association between processing speed and FA using TBSS. The regions were labeled anatomically, and fiber tracts were grouped into larger fiber bundle categories based on their anatomical and functional associations. Analyses were performed between mean skeletal FA values in each of the fiber bundles and each of the cognitive processing scores controlling for age. Children 3 years after treatment for posterior fossa brain tumors demonstrate significantly lower processing speed associated with decreased FA, compared with their healthy peers. Commissural fibers in the corpus callosum were negatively affected by disease and therapy with detrimental consequence on patients' cognitive processing. Diffusion tensor imaging of the white matter tracts in the brain is relevant to determining potential mechanisms underlying clinically meaningful change in cognitive performance.

It is caused by heterozygous or biallelic variants in FGFR1. Recently, a dominant-negative effect was suggested for FGFR1 variants associated with HS. Here, exome sequencing analysis in a 12-year-old boy with HS disclosed a novel de novo heterozygous variant c.1934C>T in FGFR1 predicted to cause the p.(Ala645Val) amino-acid substitution. In order to evaluate whether the variant, changing a highly conserved residue of the kinase domain, affects FGFR1 function, biochemical studies were employed. We measured the FGFR1 receptor activity in FGF2-treated cell lines exogenously expressing wild-type or Ala645Val FGFR1 by monitoring the activation status of FGF2/FGFR1 downstream pathways. Our analysis highlighted that RAS/ERK1/2 signaling was significantly perturbed in cells expressing mutated FGFR1, in comparison with control cells. We also provided preliminary evidence showing a modulation of the autophagic process in cells expressing mutated FGFR1.

During functional near-infrared spectroscopy recordings, all participants performed a verbal fluency task, which consisted in naming as many words as possible belonging to a given semantic category. Hemoglobin concentration changes were measured in bilateral frontal and temporal cortical areas. During the language task, results showed a strong left hemisphere response along with weaker right hemisphere activation in all groups. Age-related increases in hemodynamic responses were found bilaterally, with younger children showing smaller hemodynamic responses than adolescents and adults in both hemispheres. Overall, these findings confirm that a left hemisphere specialization is already established in young children and persists through adulthood.

Methods This is a randomized single-blinded controlled trial. The study included 62 children younger than 4 years who were deemed by the emergency physician to need a computed tomographic (CT) scan. The experimental group (Exp) (n = 30) listened to recorded children's songs with integrated heartbeat sounds (Baby Go To Sleep compact disc) before and during the head CT. The controls (Con) (n = 32) had no music. Two scales to measure agitation were completed by a trained research associate: (1) a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) and (2) the Modified Ramsay Sedation Scale (MRSS). The research associate wore headphones blocking out all music. The research associate recorded agitation levels preintervention and postintervention on the 2 scales, whether there was successful completion of the head CT without pharmacologic intervention, and the frequency of medication use. Mann-Whitney U, t test, and logistic regression were used for analysis, and P <.05 was considered significant. Results There were no differences between groups in the age, sex, initial vital signs, diagnostic category, ethnicity, insurance status, rate of completion of head CT, rate of medication use, hospital admissions, or initial VAS or MRSS score. There was improvement on the VAS score in 53% of the Exp group subjects and 25% of the Con group subjects. The VAS score in the Exp group improved by 1.6 cm, whereas the Con group worsened by 0.8 cm after the intervention (difference = 2.4 cm, P =.03). There were no significant changes in MRSS scores.

The prevalence of LD in the general population has been found to be 2-10%, and reading disorders are the most frequent subtype. Epilepsy is one of the most common serious neurological disorders in childhood. LD are more common in children with epilepsy than in the general population. As a consequence, the risk of cognitive impairment in children with epilepsy is high, and a review of the literature needs to be fully presented. Methods: Narrative review including articles regarding LD in children with various epileptic syndromes published in the international medical literature. Results: LD are more frequent among children with epilepsy. The etiology is multifactorial, being affected by the type of epileptic syndrome, the age of onset and the antiepileptic treatment being selected. LD can be either permanent or state-dependent. Each category has different treatment protocols and prognosis. Conclusions: Despite the fact that the findings of the studies discussed in our article support the evidence that epilepsy in childhood impairs the cognitive function, we should not underestimate the role of demographic and psychosocial factors on academic performance of children with epilepsy. Despite the high prevalence of LD, a healthy family and school environment can help reduce its impact on the patient's quality of life. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The incidence of paediatric stroke is estimated to be 1-3 cases per 100,000/year. During childhood, the incidence of haemorrhagic vs. ischaemic stroke is 45 vs. 55%. The aetiology of ischaemic stroke includes several factors which can be subdivided into 8 principal groups: cardiac diseases, haematologic, primary vasculopathies, trauma, metabolic diseases, drugs, surgical interventions, and neurocutaneous syndromes. Stroke symptoms, akthough varying, are usually related to the cerebral area involved in the ischaemic or haemorrhagic episode. Generally, the symptoms of an ischaemic stroke are limited to the area fed by the artery involved; while haemorrhagic stroke symptoms can be nonspecific. An essential aid in the diagnosis derives from diagnostic and laboratory procedures, such as neuroimaging investigations and coagulation parameters. Therapeutic procedures are always necessary to achieve rapid restoration and maintenance of blood supply to ischaemic areas, to minimize brain damage, and for the prevention and the treatment of acute complications and supportive care. Survival for paediatric ischaemic stroke is 85-95% in the first month and 60-80% for haemorrhagic stroke.

Additionally, age-related increases in false alarms (FAs) to semantically related lures were associated with changes in the activation profile of left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, a region associated with semantic processing. Additional regions exhibiting age-related changes include posterior parietal and anterior prefrontal cortices. In summary, concomitant changes in the MTL, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex underlie developmental increases in true and false recognition during childhood and adolescence. © 2008 The Authors.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,8.55,9,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Here, using fMRI, we investigate the development of these areas, focusing on the right FFA and FBA. Despite the overlap of functionally defined FFA and FBA (54%-75% overlap), we found that these regions developed along different trajectories. With age (7-32 years old), the FFA gradually increased in size and selectivity, and was significantly larger and more face-selective in adults than children. By contrast, the size and selectivity of the FBA did not correlate with age, and were equivalent in children and adults. Whereas in adults the FFA and FBA were comparable in size, in children the FBA was on average 70% larger than the FFA. These findings suggest that, in children, the fusiform gyrus is predominantly selective for bodies, with commensurate face-selective responses apparent later in development. Moreover, differences in the development of the FFA and FBA indicate that overlapping functional brain areas, supported by the same anatomical structure, can develop along different trajectories. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,11.8,17,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

However, materials with short T1 relaxation times may show hyperintensity signals and contaminate the TOF images. The objective of our study was to determine whether subtraction three-dimensional (3D) TOF MR angiography improves image quality in brain and temporal bone diseases with unwanted contaminations with short T1 relaxation times. Methods: During the 12-month study period, patients who had masses with short T1 relaxation times noted on precontrast T1-weighted brain MR images and 24 healthy volunteers were scanned using conventional and subtraction 3D TOF MR angiography. The qualitative evaluation of each MR angiogram was based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and scores in three categories, namely, (1) presence of misregistration artifacts, (2) ability to display arterial anatomy selectively (without contamination by materials with short T1 relaxation times), and (3) arterial flow-related enhancement. Results: We included 12 patients with intracranial hematomas, brain tumors, or middle-ear cholesterol granulomas. Subtraction 3D TOF MR angiography yielded higher CNRs between the area of the basilar artery (BA) and normal-appearing parenchyma of the brain and lower SNRs in the area of the BA compared with the conventional technique (147.7±77.6 vs. 130.6±54.2, p<0.003 and 162.5±79.9 vs. 194.3±62.3, p<0.001, respectively) in all 36 cases. The 3D subtraction angiography did not deteriorate image quality with misregistration artifacts and showed a better selective display of arteries (p<0.0001) and arterial flow-related enhancement (p<0.044) than the conventional method. Conclusion: Subtraction 3D TOF MR angiography is more appropriate than the conventional method in improving the image quality in brain and temporal bone diseases with unwanted contaminations with short T1 relaxation times. © 2013 Elsevier Taiwan LLC and the Chinese Medical Association.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,55.2,81,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Abnormalities in brain structure, cognition, and behavior have been described in children born prematurely. However, no direct in vivo evidence has yet demonstrated abnormal neural processing in these children. Our aim was to compare brain activity associated with phonologic and semantic processing of language between term and preterm children using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods. fMRI scans were acquired during a passive language comprehension task in 26 preterm children at 8 years of age and in 13 term community control children who were comparable in age, sex, maternal education, and minority status. IQ was assessed using a standard measure of intelligence. Results. The pattern of brain activity identified in a semantic processing task in the preterm children closely resembled the pattern of brain activity identified in a phonologic processing task in term controls. The greater this resemblance in the preterm children, the lower their verbal comprehension IQ scores and the poorer their language comprehension during the scanning task. Conclusions. Preterm children with the poorest language comprehension seemed not to fully engage normal semantic processing pathways in a language comprehension task. These children instead engaged pathways that normal term children used to process meaningless phonologic sounds.

Cognitive science,https://doi.org/10.1002/wcs.1404,"Among the most prevailing assumptions in science and society about the human reading  process is that sound and sound-based phonology are critical to young readers. The  child's sound-to-letter decoding is viewed as universal and vital to deriving  meaning from print. We offer a different view. The crucial link for early reading  success is not between segmental sounds and print. Instead the human brain's  capacity to segment, categorize, and discern linguistic patterning makes possible  the capacity to segment all languages. This biological process includes the  segmentation of languages on the hands in signed languages. Exposure to natural sign  language in early life equally affords the child's discovery of silent segmental  units in visual sign phonology (VSP) that can also facilitate segmental decoding of  print. We consider powerful biological evidence about the brain, how it builds sound  and sign phonology, and why sound and sign phonology are equally important in  language learning and reading. We offer a testable theoretical account, reading  model, and predictions about how VSP can facilitate segmentation and mapping between  print and meaning. We explain how VSP can be a powerful facilitator of all  children's reading success (deaf and hearing)-an account with profound  transformative impact on learning to read in deaf children with different language  backgrounds. The existence of VSP has important implications for understanding core  properties of all human language and reading, challenges assumptions about language  and reading as being tied to sound, and provides novel insight into a remarkable  biological equivalence in signed and spoken languages.

To probe this issue, we used resting state (N = 586) and behavioural (N = 255) data from a lifespan sample and tested the interactions among ten intrinsic neural systems, derived from a well-established whole-brain parcellation. Our results revealed three distinguishable profiles, whose expression strengthened with increasing age and which characterized developmental differences in connectivity within the ten systems, between networks thought to underlie cognitive control and non-control systems, and among the non-control networks. The within-network connectivity profile was typified by decreased connectivity within two external processing networks (auditory/language and ventral attention). The non-control-to-non-control connectivity profile was typified by increased separation between networks involved in external processing, including language (dorsal attention, auditory) and those linked to internally generated cognitions and category learning (default mode, subcortical). Finally, the third connectivity profile was characterized by increased coupling of the three control networks (frontoparietal, salience, cingulo-opercular) with one another and with the remaining systems, particularly the subcortical and the two networks showing declining segregation with age. All three profiles showed significant associations with behavior during young adulthood, although these effects were less discernible during early development (before the age of 21) and degraded during late middle age and older adulthood. An exception to this trend was observed with respect to the within-network connectivity profile, whose “precocious” expression during early development predicted superior cognitive functioning. These findings thus help explain lifespan changes in the quality of mental processes, while also pointing to distinguishable mechanisms, which aid behavioural performance during different life stages. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The purpose of the current paper was to identify the cerebral correlates of this VA span disorder. For this purpose, 12 French dyslexic children with severe reading and VA span disorders and 12 age-matched control children were engaged in a categorisation task under fMRI. Two flanked and isolated conditions were designed which both involved multiple-element simultaneous visual processing but taxed visual attention differently. For skilled readers, flanked stimuli processing activated a large bilateral cortical network comprising the superior and inferior parietal cortex, the inferior temporal cortex, the striate and extrastriate visual cortex, the middle frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex while the less attention-demanding task of isolated stimuli only activated the inferior occipito-temporal cortex bilaterally. With respect to controls, the dyslexic children showed significantly reduced activation within bilateral parietal and temporal areas during flanked processing, but no difference during the isolated condition. The neural correlates of the processes involved in attention-demanding multi-element processing tasks were more specifically addressed by contrasting the flanked and the isolated conditions. This contrast elicited activation of the left precuneus/superior parietal lobule in the controls, but not in the dyslexic children. These findings provide new insights on the role of parietal regions, in particular the left superior parietal lobule, in the visual attention span and in developmental dyslexia. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,10.25,NaN,NaN,visual categorical matching (letters vs. geometrical figures),NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

LL showed a phonological disorder but preserved VA span whereas FG exhibited the reverse pattern. During a phonological rhyme judgement task, LL showed decreased activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus whereas this region was activated at the level of the controls in FG. Conversely, during a visual categorization task, FG demonstrated decreased activation of the parietal lobules whereas these regions were activated in LL as in the controls. These contrasted patterns of brain activation thus mirror the cognitive disorders' dissociation.

They present with central and peripheral neurological features usually in association with other organ involvement including the eye, the heart, the liver, and kidneys, diabetes mellitus and sensorineural deafness. Current treatment is largely supportive and the disorders progress relentlessly causing significant morbidity and premature death. Vitamin supplements, pharmacological agents and exercise therapy have been used in isolated cases and small clinical trials, but the efficacy of these interventions is unclear. The first review was carried out in 2003, and identified six clinical trials. This major update was carried out to identify new studies and grade the original studies for potential bias in accordance with revised Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. To determine whether there is objective evidence to support the use of current treatments for mitochondrial disease. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (4 July 2011), CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1966 to July 2011), and EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2011), and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (including cross-over studies). Two of the authors independently selected abstracts for further detailed review. Further review was performed independently by all five authors to decide which trials fit the inclusion criteria and graded risk of bias. Participants included males and females of any age with a confirmed diagnosis of mitochondrial disease based upon muscle histochemistry, respiratory chain complex analysis of tissues or cell lines or DNA studies. Interventions included any pharmacological agent, dietary modification, nutritional supplement, exercise therapy or other treatment. The review authors excluded studies at high risk of bias in any category. The primary outcome measures included an change in muscle strength and/or endurance, or neurological clinical features. Secondary outcome measures included quality of life assessments, biochemical markers of disease and negative outcomes. Two of the authors (GP and PFC) independently identified studies for further evaluation from all abstracts within the search period. For those studies identified for further review, all five authors then independently assessed which studies met the entry criteria. For the included studies, we extracted details of the number of randomised participants, treatment, study design, study category, allocation concealment and other risk of bias criteria, and participant characteristics. Analysis was based on intention-to-treat data. We planned to use meta-analysis, but this did not prove necessary. The authors reviewed 1335 abstracts, and from these identified 21 potentially eligible abstracts. Upon detailed review, 12 studies fulfilled the entry criteria. Of these, eight were new studies that had been published since the previous version of this review. Two studies which were included in the previous version of this review were excluded because of potential for bias. The comparability of the included studies is extremely low because of differences in the specific diseases studied, differences in the therapeutic agents used, dosage, study design, and outcomes. The methodological quality of included studies was generally high, although risk of bias was unclear in random sequence generation and allocation concealment for most studies. Otherwise, the risk of bias was low for most studies in the other categories. Serious adverse events were uncommon, except for peripheral nerve toxicity in a long-term trial of dichloroacetate (DCA) in adults.One trial studied high-dose coenzyme Q10 without clinically meaningful improvement (although there were multiple biochemical, physiologic, and neuroimaging outcomes, in 30 participants). Three trials used creatine monohydrate alone, with one reporting evidence of improved measures of muscle strength and post-exercise lactate, but the other two reported no benefit (total of 38 participants). One trial studied the effects of a combination of coenzyme Q10, creatine monohydrate, and lipoic acid and reported a statistically significant improvement in biochemical markers and peak ankle dorsiflexion strength, but overall no clinical improvement in 16 participants. Five trials studied the effects of DCA: three trials in children showed a statistically significant improvement in secondary outcome measures of mitochondrial metabolism (venous lactate in three trials, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in one trial; total of 63 participants). One trial of short-term DCA in adults demonstrated no clinically relevant improvement (improved venous lactate but no change in physiologic, imaging, or questionnaire findings, in eight participants). One longer-term DCA trial in adults was terminated prematurely due to peripheral nerve toxicity without clinical benefit (assessments included the GATE score, venous lactate and MRS, in 30 participants). One trial using dimethylglycine showed no significant effect (measurements of venous lactate and oxygen consumption (VO(2)) in five participants). One trial using a whey-based supplement showed statistically significant improvement in markers of free radical reducing capacity but no clinical benefit (assessments included the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and UK Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength, in 13 participants). Despite identifying eight new trials there is currently no clear evidence supporting the use of any intervention in mitochondrial disorders.

Many patients with BD experience substantial symptomatology months or even years before full BD manifestation. Adequate diagnosis and treatment is often delayed, which is associated with a worse outcome. This study aims to prospectively evaluate and improve early recognition and intervention strategies for persons at-risk for BD. Methods: Early-BipoLife is a prospective-longitudinal cohort study of 1419 participants (aged 15–35 years) with at least five waves of assessment over a period of at least 2 years (baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months). A research consortium of ten university and teaching hospitals across Germany conducts this study. The following risk groups (RGs) were recruited: RG I: help-seeking youth and young adults consulting early recognition centres/facilities presenting ≥ 1 of the proposed risk factors for BD, RG II: in-/outpatients with unipolar depressive syndrome, and RG III: in-/outpatients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The reference cohort was selected from the German representative IMAGEN cohort. Over the study period, the natural course of risk and resilience factors, early symptoms of BD and changes of symptom severity (including conversion to manifest BD) are observed. Psychometric properties of recently developed, structured instruments on potential risk factors for conversion to BD and subsyndromal symptomatology (Bipolar Prodrome Symptom Scale, Bipolar at-risk criteria, EPIbipolar) and biomarkers that potentially improve prediction are investigated. Moreover, actual treatment recommendations are monitored in the participating specialized services and compared to recently postulated clinical categorization and treatment guidance in the field of early BD. Discussion: Findings from this study will contribute to an improved knowledge about the natural course of BD, from the onset of first noticeable symptoms (precursors) to fully developed BD, and about mechanisms of conversion from subthreshold to manifest BD. Moreover, these generated data will provide information for the development of evidence-based guidelines for early-targeted detection and preventive intervention for people at risk for BD. © 2020, The Author(s).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Through the study of two developmental amnesic patients suffering of neonatal brain injuries, we explored how the different facets of the self-memory system develop when growing up with bilateral hippocampal atrophy. Neuropsychological evaluations showed that both of them suffered from dramatic episodic learning disability with no sense of recollection (Remember/Know procedure), whereas their semantic abilities differed, being completely preserved (Valentine) or not (Jocelyn). Magnetic resonance imaging, including quantitative volumetric measurements of the hippocampus and adjacent (entorhinal, perirhinal, and temporopolar) cortex, showed severe bilateral atrophy of the hippocampus in both patients, with additional atrophy of adjacent cortex in Jocelyn. Exploration of EAM and SAM according to lifetime periods covering the entire lifespan (TEMPAu task, Piolino et al., 2009) showed that both patients had marked impairments in EAM, as they lacked specificity, details and sense of recollection, whereas SAM was completely normal in Valentine, but impaired in Jocelyn. Finally, measures of patients’ CS (Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, Fitts and Warren, 1996), checked by their mothers, were generally within normal range, but both patients showed a more positive self-concept than healthy controls. These two new cases support a modular account of the medial-temporal lobe with episodic memory and recollection depending on the hippocampus, and semantic memory and familiarity on adjacent cortices. Furthermore, they highlight developmental episodic and semantic functional independence within the self-memory system suggesting that SAM and CS may be acquired without episodic memories.

Antisocial behaviour typically onsets before adulthood and is reflected in antisocial individuals at the biological level. We therefore conducted a brain-based study of emotion processing in juvenile offenders. Male adolescent offenders and age-matched non-offenders passively viewed emotional images whilst their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography. The early posterior negativity (EPN) and the late positive potential (LPP) components were used as indices of emotion processing. For both juvenile offenders and non-offenders, the EPN differentiated unpleasant images from other image types, suggesting that early perceptual processing was not impaired in the offender group. In line with normal emotion processing, the LPP was significantly enhanced following unpleasant images for non-offenders. However, for juvenile offenders, the LPP did not differ across image categories, indicative of deficient emotional processing. The findings indicated that this brain-based hypo-reactivity occurred during a late stage of cognitive processing and was not a consequence of atypical early visual attention or perception. This study is the first to show attenuated emotion processing in juvenile offenders at the neural level.

We aimed to assess whether specific neuroimaging features in CCM patients correlate with neurodevelopmental outcomes. Method: Hospital records and neuroimaging of 67 children with CCMs were systematically reviewed. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations between specific imaging features and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Results: CCM categories were distributed as follows: 28 percent isolated vermis hypoplasia (n=19), 28 percent global cerebellar hypoplasia (n=19), 15 percent Dandy–Walker malformation (n=10), 13 percent pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH, n=9), 9 percent molar tooth malformation (n=6), 3 percent rhombencephalosynapsis (n=2), and 3 percent unilateral cerebellar malformation (n=2). Overall, 85 percent (55/65) of the cohort had global developmental delay (GDD). Intellectual disability was present in 61 percent (27/43) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 12 percent (6/52). Adjusting for supratentorial malformations and presence of genetic findings, severe GDD was associated with cerebellar hypoplasia (p=0.049) and PCH (p=0.030), whereas children with vermis hypoplasia were less likely to have severe GDD (p=0.003). Presence of supratentorial abnormalities was not significantly associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcome but was associated with epilepsy. Interpretation: Children with CCMs have high prevalence of neurodevelopmental deficits. Specific features on imaging can aid prognostication and establish early intervention strategies. What this paper adds: Atypical long-term neurodevelopmental outcome is very common in patients with congenital cerebellar malformations (CCMs). Involvement of the brainstem and cerebellar hemispheres predicts more severe neurodevelopmental disability. Most patients with vermis hypoplasia have language delay but are verbal. Supratentorial abnormalities are not significantly associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcome but are associated with epilepsy.

Furthermore, there have been few attempts to evaluate the familiality of OCD symptom dimensions. The purpose of this study was to extend prior work by this collaborative group in category-based dimensions by conducting the first-ever exploratory dichotomous factor analysis using individual OCD symptoms, comparing these results to a refined category-level solution, and testing the familiality of derived factors. Participants were 485 adults in the six-site OCD Collaborative Genetics Study, diagnosed with lifetime OCD using semi-structured interviews. YBOCS-SC data were factor analyzed at both the individual item and symptom category levels. Factor score intraclass correlations were calculated using a subsample of 145 independent affected sib pairs. The item- and category-level factor analyses yielded nearly identical 5-factor solutions.

It grows throughout lifetime with our experiences and is built up from general self-knowledge and specific memories. The study of autobiographical memory depicts the dynamic and reconstructive features of this type of long-term memory, combining both semantic and episodic aspects, its strength and fragility. In this article, we propose to illustrate the properties of autobiographical memory from the field of cognitive psychology, neuropsychology and neuroimaging research through the analysis of the mechanisms of disturbance in normal and Alzheimer's disease. We show that the cognitive and neural bases of autobiographical memory are distinct in both cases. In normal aging, autobiographical memory retrieval is mainly dependent on frontal/executive function and on sense of reexperiencing specific context connected to hippocampal regions regardless of memory remoteness. In Alzheimer's disease, autobiographical memory deficit, characterized by a Ribot's temporal gradient, is connected to different regions according to memory remoteness. Our functional neuroimaging results suggestthat patients at the early stage can compensate for their massive deficit of episodic recent memories correlated to hippocampal alteration with overgeneral remote memories related to prefrontal regions. On the whole, the research findings allowed initiating new autobiographical memory studies by comparing normal and pathological aging and developing cognitive methods of memory rehabilitation in patients based on preserved personal semantic capacity. © 2010 Société de Biologie.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

During childhood, a pattern of increasing left lateralization for language has been described in brain imaging studies, suggesting that this trait develops. This development could reflect change due to brain maturation or change due to skill acquisition, given that children acquire and refine language skills as they mature. We test the possibility that skill acquisition, independent of age-associated maturation can result in shifts in language lateralization in classic language cortex. We imaged adults exposed to an unfamiliar language during three successive fMRI scans. Participants were then asked to identify specific words embedded in Norwegian sentences. Exposure to these sentences, relative to complex tones, resulted in consistent activation in the left and right superior temporal gyrus. Activation in this region became increasingly left-lateralized with repeated exposure to the unfamiliar language.

The emergence of such functional specialization in the human cortex represents a pivotal developmental process, which provides a basis for targeted and efficient information processing. For example, functional specialization to print in the left vOT is an important prerequisite for fluent reading. However, it remains unclear, which processes initiate the preferential cortical activations to characters arising in the vOT during child development. Using a multimodal neuroimaging approach with preschool children at familial risk for developmental dyslexia, we demonstrate how varying levels of expertise modulate the neural response to single characters, which represent the building blocks of print units. The level of expertise to characters was manipulated firstly through brief training of false-font speech–sound associations and secondly by comparing characters for which children differed in their level of familiarity and expertise accumulated through abundant exposure in their everyday environment. Neural correlates of character processing were tracked with simultaneous high-density electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging in a target detection task. We found training performance and expertise-dependent modulation of the visual event-related potential around 220 ms (N1) and the corresponding vOT activation. Additionally, trained false-font characters revealed stronger functional connectivity between the left fusiform gyrus (FFG) seed and left superior parietal/lateral occipital cortex regions with higher training performance. In sum, our results demonstrate that learning artificial-character speech–sound associations enhances activation to trained characters in the vOT and that the magnitude of this activation and the functional connectivity of the left FFG to the parieto-occipital cortex depends on learning performance. This pattern of results suggests emerging development of the reading network after brief training that parallels network specialization during reading acquisition. © 2019 The Authors",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,6.7,7,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Pedophiles show sexual interest in prepubescent children but not in adults. Research into the neurofunctional mechanisms of paraphilias has gathered momentum over the last years. Aim. To elucidate the underlying neural processing of sexual interest among pedophiles and to highlight the differences in comparison with nonparaphilic sexual interest in adults. Methods. Nine pedophilic patients and 11 nonpedophilic control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing pictures of nude (prepubescents, pubescents, and adults) and neutral content, as well as performing a concomitant choice reaction time task (CRTT). Main Outcome Measures. Brain blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals and response latencies in the CRTT during exposure to each picture category. Results. Analysis of behavioral data showed group differences in reaction times regarding prepubescent and adult but not pubescent stimuli. During stimulation with pictures displaying nude prepubescents, pedophiles showed increased BOLD response in brain areas known to be involved in processing of visual sexual stimuli. Comparison of pedophilic patients with the control group discovered differences in BOLD responses with respect to prepubescent and adult but not to pubescent stimuli. Differential effects in particular occurred in the cingulate gyrus and insular region. Conclusions. The brain response of pedophiles to visual sexual stimulation by images of nude prepubescents is comparable with previously described neural patterns of sexual processing in nonpedophilic human males evoked by visual stimuli depicting nude adults. Nevertheless, group differences found in the cingulate gyrus and the insular region suggest an important role of these brain areas in pedophilic sexual interest. Furthermore, combining attention-based methods like CRTT with fMRI may be a viable option for future diagnostic procedures regarding pedophilia. © 2011 International Society for Sexual Medicine.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

An event-related fMRI experiment was conducted using an auditory lexical decision task in which word and nonword stimuli varied in terms of neighborhood density (high and low).

The comparison between high and low frequency words revealed greater activation for high frequency words in both anterior and posterior left middle temporal gyrus. A significant interaction between density and frequency was found in lateral and medial frontal structures.

It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. The impaired reading in dyslexia is associated with inability to process the sensory input that enters the nervous system. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a potential source in understanding the neurobiology and to identify the brain basis of sensory stimuli processed in dyslexic patients. Methodology: The present study was conducted to assess the difference in neural changes using fMRI in children and adolescents with SLD compared with normal children and also the correlation of clinical parameters with BOLD – fMRI changes. Sixteen children and adolescents diagnosed as dyslexia were assessed with All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) SLD Battery, Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI KID) and Aggregated Neurobehavioral Student Health and Educational Review (ANSER) system and compared with 15 controls matched with age and sex. Participants of both groups were asked to perform 3 tasks during the fMRI acquisition (phonological, picture-naming and semantic tasks). Result: As compared to control group, the participants with dyslexia show phonological decoding problem. During picture task, the participants with dyslexia use more areas of brain involve in recalling the memory events while during semantic tasks processing the occipito-temporal (fusiform) gyrus was less activated when in contrast to control. Conclusion: This study shows that participants with dyslexia fail to use normal brain regions specialized in language processing, but rather use different areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,12.46,16,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

After normal speech and language development, aphasia develops between the ages of 3-7. years in a period ranging from days to months. The epileptic discharges usually disappear after reaching adulthood, but language outcomes are usually poor if no treatment focused on restoration of (non-) verbal communication is given. Patients often appear deaf-mute, but sign language, as part of the treatment, may lead to recovery of communication. The neural mechanisms underlying poor language outcomes in LKS are not yet understood. In this detailed functional MRI study of a recovered LKS patient - that is, a patient no longer suffering from epileptic discharges, audiovisual multi-sensory processing was investigated, since LKS patients are often proficient in reading, but not in speech perception. In the recovered LKS patient a large difference in the neural activation to auditory stimuli was found in the left versus the right auditory cortex, which cannot be attributed to hearing loss. Compared to healthy proficient readers investigated earlier with the same fMRI experiment, the patient demonstrated normal letter-sound integration in the superior temporal gyrus as demonstrated by the multi-sensory interaction index, indicating intact STG function. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) based fiber tracking in the LKS patient showed fibers originating from Heschl's gyrus that seem to be left-right inverted with respect to HG fiber pattern described in the literature for healthy controls. In the patient, in both hemispheres we found arcuate fibers projecting from (homologues of) Broca's to Wernicke's areas, and a lack of fibers from arcuate left inferior parietal and sylvian areas reported in healthy subjects. We observed short arcuate segments in the right hemisphere. Although speculative, our results suggest intact temporal lobe processing but an altered temporal to frontal connectivity. The altered connectivity might explain observed short-term verbal memory problems, disturbed (speech) sound-motor interaction and online feedback of speech and might be one of the neuronal factors underlying LKS. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,22.8,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Experiment 1 used an accuracy judgment task that would draw participants' attention to the violation of the writing sequence whereas Experiment 2 required participants to judge the completion of the display and thus the more automatic aspects of sequence processing could be revealed. In Experiment 1, the within-radical boundary reversal produced bilateral posterior N2 enhancement and the cross-boundary reversal elicited a left N2 effect and right posterior N2 reduction on the critical stroke. Both types of reversal elicited P3 effects on the critical stroke and sustained negativity effects on the following stroke, with the size being larger for the cross-boundary reversal. In Experiment 2, in addition to the P3 effects, the within-boundary reversal elicited a left posterior N2 effect and the cross-boundary reversal elicited right posterior N2 reduction on the critical stroke. Moreover, on the following stroke, the cross-boundary reversal elicited a right N2 effect and both types of reversal elicited sustained positivity effects. These findings demonstrate that native Chinese readers use their sequential knowledge to predict upcoming strokes in perceiving the writing of characters and to construct appropriate representations for the action sequence regardless of whether such predictions and constructions are required by the task.

We thus set out to investigate the long-term effects of childhood trauma exposure on brain function of adult chronic patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and (psychotic) bipolar-I disorder while performing a standard 2/0-back working memory task. Participants were 50 cases diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (SCZ), 42 cases with bipolar-I disorder (BD), and 47 healthy controls (HC). Among this sample, 56 clinical cases (SCZ = 32; BD = 24) and 17 HC reported significant levels of childhood trauma, while 36 clinical cases (SCZ = 18; BD = 18) and 30 HC did not. Effects of childhood trauma on working memory-related brain activation were examined in combined samples of clinical cases (independently of diagnosis) relative to HCs, as well as within each diagnostic category. Case–control analyses revealed increased activation of the left inferior parietal lobule as a main effect of trauma exposure. In addition, trauma exposure interacted with a diagnosis of SCZ or BD to reveal trauma-related increased activation in the cuneus in clinical cases and decreased activation in this region in controls. Disorder-specific functional alterations were also evident in the SCZ sample, but not BD. Childhood trauma exposure elicits aberrant function of parietal regions involved in working memory performance regardless of clinical status, as well as task-relevant visual regions that participates to attentional processes.

This overlap has been taken to suggest that individuals draw on past personal experiences to infer others’ mental states, but work with amnesic people shows that ToM does not always depend on AM. One variable that may determine the extent to which one relies on AM when inferring another's thoughts and feelings during ToM is whether that individual is personally known. To test this possibility, participants were scanned with fMRI as they remembered past experiences in response to personal photos (‘AM’ condition) and imagined others’ experiences in response to photos of personally familiar (‘pToM’ condition) and unfamiliar (‘ToM’ condition) others. Spatiotemporal Partial Least Squares was used to identify the spatial and temporal characteristics of neural activation patterns associated with AM, pToM, and ToM. We found that the brain regions supporting pToM more closely resembled those supporting AM relative to ToM involving unfamiliar others, with the greatest degree of overlap within midline regions. A complementary finding was the observation of striking differences between pToM and ToM such that midline regions associated with AM predominated during pToM, whereas more lateral regions associated with social semantic memory predominated during ToM. Overall, this study demonstrates that ToM involves a dynamic interplay between AM and social semantic memory that is biased towards AM when a personally familiar other is the subject of the mental state inference.

Methods: Among the 664 patients who underwent ATL for TLE from 1995 to 2008, there were 134 children. “Excellent” outcome in them was defined as seizure freedom during the entire follow-up (Engel class I a); “good outcome” if in remission last 2 years, and the rest as “unfavorable outcome”. To identify the potential predictors of seizure recurrence, the attributes of recurred and non-recurred groups was compared by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Of the 134 children, at a mean post-operative follow-up of 8.1 years, there were 82 (61.1%) with excellent outcome and 26 (19.4%) with good outcome (category-1; seizure-free, 80.6%). Drugs could be successfully withdrawn in 69 (63.9%). 26 patients (22.4%) had seizure recurrence, (category-2, treatment/surgical failure).Whereas, of the 530 adults who underwent ATL during this time period, only 46.8% never had seizures (category-1) and 53.2% had seizure recurrence in the form of acute post-operative seizures or auras or habitual or non-habitual seizures (category-2).The hazard of seizure recurrence in children increased with positive family history of seizures and /or epilepsy, normal neuroimaging, spikes in post-operative EEG at 3-months, normal histopathology and duration of epilepsy ≥5 years. Conclusions: The information on the predictive factors causing seizure recurrence/freedom in children with drug-resistant TLE is important in surgical selection.

To test this theory, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain activity during category fluency in participants who had sustained pre-or perinatal left hemisphere stroke (n = 25) and in neurologically normal siblings (n = 27). In typically developing children, performance of a category fluency task elicits strong involvement of left frontal and lateral temporal regions and a lesser involvement of right hemisphere structures. In our cohort of atypically developing participants with early stroke, expressive and receptive language skills correlated with activity in the same left inferior frontal regions that support language processing in neurologically normal children. This was true independent of either the amount of brain injury or the extent that the injury was located in classical cortical language processing areas. Participants with bilateral activation in left and right superior temporal-inferior parietal regions had better language function than those with either predominantly left-or right-sided unilateral activation. The advantage conferred by left inferior frontal and bilateral temporal involvement demonstrated in our study supports a strong predisposition for typical neural language organization, despite an intervening injury, and argues against models suggesting that the right hemisphere fully accommodates language function following early injury. © The Author (2010).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,16.25,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Simultaneous 122-channel whole-head MEG and 33-channel EEG were recorded for 20 to 40 minutes during spontaneous sleep. The EEG and MEG data were separated and four blinded independent reviewers marked the presence and timing of epileptic discharges (ED) in the 28 data segments. EEG and MEG data were matched and spikes identified by at least three reviewers were classified in three categories according to the following criteria: type 1 MEG > EEG, type 2 EEG > MEG (type 1/2: difference of three or more raters), and type 3 EEG = MEG (three or more raters each). The presence of simultaneous sleep changes was visually determined for every single EEG-segment. Spikes with high spatiotemporal correlation were averaged and subjected to single dipole analysis of peak activity in EEG. Out of 4704 marked patterns, 1387 spikes fulfilled the above criteria. In fact, more spikes were unique to MEG (689) than to EEG (136) and to the combination of both modalities (562). ED were detected predominantly by MEG in eight patients and by EEG in two patients. The presence of vertex waves and spindles lead to a significantly higher number of spikes identified only in MEG. Averaging of type 1 spikes produced clear spike activity in EEG in 9 of 12 cases. On the contrary, only 2 of 10 type 2 spikes were visible in MEG after averaging. Dipoles of spikes visible in MEG showed a more tangential orientation compared with more radial dipoles of type 2 spikes. Spike characteristics, e.g., dipole orientation, are a key factor for a sole EEG representation. Exclusive MEG detection is more likely influenced by overlapping background activity in EEG. Because MEG is indifferent to radial activity, i.e., sleep changes, a higher ratio of spikes unique to MEG compared with EEG is detected in the case of overlapping sleep changes.

The success of epilepsy surgery depends upon the accurate preoperative localization of the epileptogenic zone and its complete resection. Children with medically refractory lesional epilepsies belong to different categories depending upon the degree of complexity involved in the presurgical evaluation to define their epileptogenic zone. While some patients, such as those with tumoral epilepsy syndrome, can be selected for surgery by simple noninvasive presurgical evaluation strategy, others with malformations of cortical development and those with multiple lesions often require complex and invasive means to define their epileptogenic zone. Recent advances in structural and functional imaging have obviated the need of invasive monitoring in the majority.

We hypothesized that childhood emotional abuse, which is disruptive of emotional regulation, would differentially impact neurometabolite concentrations of the RPFC, and related neocortical areas, in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) versus healthy controls. Methods GAD patients (n=16; females=11) and medically healthy volunteers (n=16; F=10) were assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), specifically the emotional abuse category. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging examined 3 regions of interest (ROI) from the most rostral slice from the Duyn et al. (1993) multivoxel imaging modality: rostral prefrontal cortex (BA 10,9), premotor cortex (BA 6,8) and secondary somatosensory and associated parietal cortex (BA 5,7). Metabolites included N-acetyl-aspartate, creatine, and choline. Results GAD patients reported higher emotional abuse scores versus controls. An omnibus general linear model including 3 ROI, 3 metabolites, and laterality as dependent variables revealed a significant diagnosis by CTQ emotional abuse score interactive effect. In controls, all 3 ROI for all 3 metabolites on both sides demonstrated a significant inverse relationship with emotional abuse scores; none were significant in GAD patients. Limitations A major limitation is the uneven distribution of emotional abuse scores between the controls and GAD patients, with GAD patients reporting higher scores. Conclusion Unlike controls, GAD patients appear compromised in forming a molecular representation reflective of magnitude of childhood emotional abuse. The neurometabolites in GAD patients appear non-aligned to childhood emotional abuse, suggesting potential consequences for normative ""theory of mind"" processes and emotional function in certain anxiety disorders. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This chapter examines executive function training, one category of these emerging treatment interventions that has garnered widespread interest among clinicians, mental health professionals, and parents of children with ADHD. We summarize the accumulating evidence from neuroimaging studies initially to provide fundamental insights into why children with ADHD continue to experience significant impairment across a wide range of functional outcomes despite receiving the most efficacious treatments available over an extended time period. The ensuing section highlights the evolving literature on executive functions (EFs) and the extent to which particular EFs and/or their component processes are deficient and related to cote clinical features (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity) and functional outcomes in children with ADHD. Afterward, we describe two broad categories of EF training programs, facilitative intervention training (FIT) and mindfulness. We focus on these two particular training programs because they share two common tenets: (1) that many of these children's behavioral, cognitive, interpersonal, and learning difficulties are outcomes of underdeveloped or poorly regulated EF processes, and (2) that these EF processes can be strengthened or corrected through training and extended practice. In the final section, we summarize extant evidence supporting FIT and mindfulness interventions. We also discuss what we believe represents the most critical issues that must be resolved to enable these types of interventions to bring about fundamental and lasting changes in the cognitive abilities and associated functional outcomes in children with ADHD.

However, most neuroimaging studies on AB to date only contain relatively small sample sizes. To objectively investigate the consistency of previous structural and functional research in adolescent AB, we performed a systematic literature review and two coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses on eight VBM and nine functional neuroimaging studies in a total of 783 participants (408 [224AB/184 controls] and 375 [215 AB/160 controls] for structural and functional analysis respectively). We found 19 structural and eight functional foci of significant alterations in adolescents with AB, mainly located within the emotion processing and regulation network (including orbitofrontal, dorsomedial prefrontal and limbic cortex). A subsequent conjunction analysis revealed that functional and structural alterations co-localize in right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and left insula. Our results are in line with meta-analytic work as well as structural, functional and connectivity findings to date, all of which make a strong point for the involvement of a network of brain areas responsible for emotion processing and regulation, which is disrupted in AB. Increased knowledge about the behavioural and neuronal underpinnings of AB is crucial for the development of novel and implementation of existing treatment strategies. Longitudinal research studies will have to show whether the observed alterations are a result or primary cause of the phenotypic characteristics in AB.

No data are present in pediatrics on the presentation and management of AD. Aim This study investigated characteristics, etiology and health care utilization of the pediatric population with AD accessed to pediatric Emergency Departments (ED), trying to identify “red flags” associated with potentially life-threatening (LT) conditions. Methods We conducted a cohort multicenter study on children with AD in ten Italian hospitals. Patients were classified into diagnostic categories, comparing children with and without LT disease. Results 621 children presented AD at a rate of 3.6 per 10.000. The most frequent diagnosis among no-LT conditions (81.2%) were headache, ocular disorders and minor post-traumatic disease, while LT conditions (18.8%) were represented by brain tumors, demyelinating conditions, idiopathic intracranial hypertension and major post-traumatic diseases. The LT group showed a significantly higher age, with the odds increased by 1% for each month of age. Monocular diplopia occurred in 16.1%, but unlike adult one-fifth presented LT conditions. Binocular diplopia, associated ocular manifestations or extraocular neurological signs were significantly more common in the LT group. At regression logistic analysis strabismus and ptosis were associated with LT conditions. Conclusion The majority of children presented no-LT conditions and more than one-fourth of patients had headache.

There is preliminary support for the use of computerized neuropsychological testing. The prognostic use of proteomics is a promising area of future research. Pre-injury and injury-related characteristics have been thoroughly examined and developed into a clinical risk score for predicting delayed recovery.

Child mental health has several needs for such technology. The field needs to rapidly and easily measure the various capacities of the central nervous system (CNS) so that we can accurately evaluate cognitive, emotional, and behavioral variation. We need to go further and measure the genetic variation of these domains to understand risk and vulnerability prior to their developmental manifestations. The discovery, testing, validation, and dissemination of technological procedures to fill gaps in our assessment protocols could reshape our practice of patient care, standards of treatment, the scope of our intervention goals, and the direction in which resources are expended on mental health care. We currently face many problems with assessment that are still answered in ways based on decades-old approaches. What tools do we need, for example, that would allow us to know if a child with poor academic progress and identified dyslexia also had attentional problems that were consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) inattentive type? Or if an adolescent presented as withdrawn, isolated, and self-destructive, what neurobiological assessment would allow us to easily tell whether this was an acute reaction to significant loss, a major depressive disorder, or bipolar disorder? Could we use neuroimaging to separate very early prodromes of schizophrenia from Asperger's syndrome? Could we curtail the time burden of developmental, family, and medical history-taking by simply applying a piece of modern-day miracle technology? Do we have the neurobiological tools to refine diagnosis and treatment planning? At this point we do not. If we could, our entire nomenclature might need changing. For example, if neuroimaging provided enough information about brain-behavior relationships we might decide that disorders of the frontal cortex should be a major DSMx category. Limbic system disorders might encompass depression, anxiety, and adjustment disorders if assessment techniques could discriminate among them. New categories would group global brain problems such as mental retardation and autism together. Specific brain region disorders would be a collection of problems such as simple motor tic disorder, habit disorders, and blepharospasm. Rapid neurobiological assessment using one of the many forms of imaging such as positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and the various forms of magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) would improve identification and move treatment to early onset or even prodromal stages. We now have these technologies but they have not revolutionized the way we work with patients, and it may be time to hope the next generation of technologies will create these opportunities. An alternative is to start to look elsewhere for technologies that are waiting to be brought to clinical practice.

Study design: A cohort of 198 children born <30 weeks' gestational age and/or <1250 g, and 70 term controls were examined. White matter abnormalities were rated quantitatively on brain magnetic resonance imaging at term-equivalent age. Language was assessed at age 7 years using standardized language tests. Differences between groups were tested in the 5 language subdomains of phonological awareness, semantics, grammar, discourse, and pragmatics. A mediation effect was tested between birth group, white matter abnormality, and language subdomains. Results: The VPT/VLBW group performed significantly worse than controls on all language subdomains (all P < .001). White matter abnormality mediated the effect of group differences on phonological awareness, and partly mediated this effect for semantics, grammar, and discourse. White matter abnormality was not significantly associated with pragmatics (P = .13). Conclusions: Language is an important area of concern in children born VPT/VLBW.

CLRE is a large nonspecific category within the ILAE classification. For this population no unequivocal prognosis exists. Methods: Twenty-five articles describing aspects of CLRE were included in this review. Results: As a result of the progress in epilepsy research, as well as more advanced investigation in individual cases, the population with CLRE constantly changes. Also, disagreement on interpretation of the classification has resulted in striking differences between the populations described. High remission rates are reported, but relapse occurs frequently, leaving the long-term prognosis unforeseeable. This is reflected in academic and psychosocial prognosis, which is described to be problematic in CLRE specifically. Possible prognostic factors of CLRE in children have been identified: age at onset, seizure semiology, seizure frequency, intractability, interictal epileptiform activity on EEG, and premorbid IQ. These factors are explored to define subgroups within the CLRE population. Discussion: Prospective studies on well-defined CLRE cohorts are needed to identify factors that distinguish various prognostic subgroups.

Secondly, these series were used with rnTMS preoperatively in five children with epilepsy. Naming errors induced by the stimulation comprised no response, delayed response, semantic error, phonological error, and self-correction. Language laterality was compared with the results of a dichotic listening test and with neuropsychological tests with respect to general laterality, and general language abilities were considered with respect to the results of stimulation. One participant had below normal general language abilities, two had below-normal rapid naming, and three had slow and indistinct articulation. Laterality was only clear in two of the participants.

An MRI scan of the brain found acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, with a preponderance of white matter degeneration in the bilateral frontal lobes. Interval MRIs showed continued degeneration. Confirmation of Alexander disease was made at age 20 through genetic testing. Four evaluations completed from ages 15 to 21 showed impairment across all cognitive domains. Cognitive deficits were most prominent in new learning and recent memory, executive functions, and fine motor dexterity, and less apparent in information processing and visual scanning speed. These results present evidence for a particular cognitive pattern in individuals with juvenile-onset Alexander disease. Despite extensive white matter degeneration in the frontal lobes, certain tasks associated with frontal lobe integrity were relatively preserved. Further research into the neuropsychological presentation of the subtypes of Alexander disease can enhance diagnostic clarity and treatment planning.

To handle the complexity of neuroimaging data and to convert brain images in informative biomarkers of pathology, multivariate analysis techniques based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been widely used in several disease conditions. They are usually trained to distinguish patients from healthy control subjects by making a binary classification. Here, we propose the use of the One-Class Classification (OCC) or Data Description method that, in contrast to two-class classification, is based on a description of one class of objects only. This approach, by defining a multivariate normative rule on one class of subjects, allows recognizing examples from a different category as outliers. We applied the OCC to 314 regional features extracted from brain structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of young children with ASD (21 males and 20 females) and control subjects (20 males and 20 females), matched on age [range: 22-72 months of age; mean = 49 months] and non-verbal intelligence quotient (NVIQ) [range: 31-123; mean = 73]. We demonstrated that a common pattern of features characterize the ASD population. The OCC SVM trained on the group of ASD subjects showed the following performances in the ASD vs. controls separation: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.74 for the male and 0.68 for the female population, respectively. Notably, the ASD vs. controls discrimination results were maximized when evaluated on the subsamples of subjects with NVIQ = 70, leading to AUC = 0.81 for the male and AUC = 0.72 for the female populations, respectively. Language regions and regions from the default mode network-posterior cingulate cortex, pars opercularis and pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, and transverse temporal gyrus-contributed most to distinguishing individuals with ASD from controls, arguing for the crucial role of these areas in the ASD pathophysiology. The observed brain patterns associate preschoolers with ASD independently of their age, gender and NVIQ and therefore they are expected to constitute part of the ASD brain endophenotype. © 2016 Retico, Gori, Giuliano, Muratori and Calderoni.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,4.1,5,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

By including several linguistic and nonlinguistic conditions within our paradigm, we were also able to test whether the processing of semantically reversible sentences places additional load on sentence-specific processing, such as syntactic processing and syntactic-semantic integration, or on phonological working memory. Our results identified increased activation for reversible sentences in a region on the left temporal-parietal boundary, which was also activated when the same group of participants carried out an articulation task which involved saying ""one, three"" repeatedly.

Here, we investigated whether multisensory perception of gender is influenced by infant-directed (IDS) or adult-directed (ADS) speech. Six-, 9-, and 12-month-old infants saw side-by-side silent video-clips of talking faces (a male and a female) and heard either a soundtrack of a female or a male voice telling a story in IDS or ADS. Infants participated in only one condition, either IDS or ADS. Consistent with earlier work, infants displayed advantages in matching female relative to male faces and voices. Moreover, the new finding that emerged in the current study was that extraction of gender from face and voice was stronger at 6 months with ADS than with IDS, whereas at 9 and 12 months, matching did not differ for IDS versus ADS. The results indicate that the ability to perceive gender in audiovisual speech is influenced by speech manner. Our data suggest that infants may extract multisensory gender information developmentally earlier when looking at adults engaged in conversation with other adults (i.e., ADS) than when adults are directly talking to them (i.e., IDS). Overall, our findings imply that the circumstances of social interaction may shape early multisensory abilities to perceive gender.

The results show that verbal fluency scores correlated mainly with measures of brain morphology in the left inferior frontal cortex and bilateral insula.

However, this risk-centered approach neglects variations in individual-level and environmental characteristics that portend differential pathways that are distinguishable by timing of substance use initiation (e.g., early versus delayed), the likelihood of use escalation versus eventual desistance, and enduring abstinence, despite exposure to significant risk factors. Considering the various underpinnings of these distinct substance use trajectories is critical to a more nuanced understanding of the effects, potency, and malleability of factors that are known to increase risk or confer protection. Here, we discuss three pathways relative to substance use patterns and predictors in the context of adversity, a well-known, highly significant influence on propensity for substance misuse. The first pathway is designated as ""high risk"" based on early onset of substance use, rapid escalation, and proneness to substance use disorders. Individuals who defy all odds and eventually exhibit adaptive developmental outcomes despite an initial maladaptive reaction to adversity, are referred to as ""resilient."" However, another categorization that has not been adequately characterized is ""resistant."" Resistant individuals include those who do not exhibit problematic substance use behaviors (e.g., early onset and escalation) and do not develop substance use disorders or other forms of psychopathology, despite significant exposure to factors that normally increase the propensity for such outcomes (e.g.Trauma and/or adversity). In this paper, we apply this conceptualization of risk, resistance, and resilience for substance misuse to a more fine-grained analysis of substance use pathways and their corresponding patterns (e.g., non-use, initiation, escalation, desistance). The significance of the progression of neurocognitive functioning over the course of development is discussed as well as how this knowledge may be translated to make a science-based determination of intervention targets. This more encompassing theoretical model has direct implications for primary prevention and clinical approaches to disrupt risk pathways and to optimize long-Term outcomes. © 2007-2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

Associative memory improves across development, and this age-related improvement is supported by the development of the hippocampus and pFC. Recent work, however, additionally suggests a role for visual association cortex in the formation of associative memories. This study investigated the role of category-preferential visual processing regions in associative memory across development using a paired associate learning task in a sample of 56 youths (age 6–19 years). Participants were asked to bind an emotional face with an object while undergoing fMRI scanning. Outside the scanner, participants completed a memory test. We first investigated age-related changes in neural recruitment and found linear age-related in- creases in activation in lateral occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus, which are involved in visual processing of objects and faces, respectively. Furthermore, greater activation in these visual processing regions was associated with better subsequent memory for pairs over and above the effect of age and of hippocampal and pFC activation on performance. Recruitment of these visual processing regions mediated the association between age and memory performance, over and above the effects of hippocampal activation. Taken together, these findings extend the existing literature to suggest that greater recruitment of category-preferential visual processing regions during encoding of associative memories is a neural mechanism explaining improved memory across development. © 2017 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,13.68,19,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We tested the usefulness of synchronous video recording to identify and model the fMRI changes associated with non-epileptic movements to improve sensitivity and specificity of fMRI maps related to interictal epileptiform discharges (IED). New methods: Categorization of different facial/cranial movements during EEG-fMRI was obtained for 38 patients [with benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS, n= 16); with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE, n= 17); focal symptomatic/cryptogenic epilepsy (n= 5)]. We compared at single subject- and at group-level the IED-related fMRI maps obtained with and without additional regressors related to spontaneous movements. As secondary aim, we considered facial movements as events of interest to test the usefulness of video information to obtain fMRI maps of the following face movements: swallowing, mouth-tongue movements, and blinking. Results: Video information substantially improved the identification and classification of the artifacts with respect to the EEG observation alone (mean gain of 28 events per exam). Comparison with existing method: Inclusion of physiological activities as additional regressors in the GLM model demonstrated an increased Z-score and number of voxels of the global maxima and/or new BOLD clusters in around three quarters of the patients. Video-related fMRI maps for swallowing, mouth-tongue movements, and blinking were comparable to the ones obtained in previous task-based fMRI studies. Conclusions: Video acquisition during EEG-fMRI is a useful source of information. Modeling physiological movements in EEG-fMRI studies for epilepsy will lead to more informative IED-related fMRI maps in different epileptic conditions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Gaussian-process regression coordinate-based meta-analysis was used to examine sex differences in voxel-based regional volume and density. On average, males have larger total brain volumes than females. Examination of the breakdown of studies providing total volumes by age categories indicated a bias towards the 18–59 year-old category.

We are aware of thirty previously reported cases. We present four additional patients with this condition. Previously reported patients have shown the hallmark triad of rhombocephalosynapsis, trigeminal anesthesia, and bilateral parietal or parieto-occipital alopecia. Rhombencephalosynapsis consists of agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres, and the dentate nuclei. The gene or genes responsible for GLHS remain unknown. Alopecia is seen in all previously reported cases of GLHS. Additional craniofacial findings such as low-set and posteriorly rotated ears, midface retrusion, craniosynostosis, and brachyturricephaly are also very common in this syndrome. Trigeminal anesthesia, reported in the original three patients, is seen in just over half of reported patients. Most patients with GLHS have motor delays, intellectual disability, and hypotonia. Unusual stereotypic movements of the head are seen in many patients with GLHS. Neuroimaging of patients with GLHS shows rhombencephalosynapsis is universally present, with ventriculomegaly/hydrocephalus and cerebellar hypoplasia being common. We propose that rhombencephalosynapsis and scalp alopecia are necessary, but by themselves not sufficient, for a diagnosis of GLHS. Additional findings of trigeminal anesthesia or one of two major craniofacial findings (brachycephaly and/or turricephaly or midface retrusion) are sufficient to make a diagnosis of GLHS.

We examined the association between GAD symptoms and sensitivity to recognizing emotional facial expressions (emotion sensitivity: ES) for three emotions (happiness, anger, fear) in a large, diverse, population-based sample. We hypothesized that higher anxiety scores would be associated with poorer performance, and expected that ES performance and anxiety scores would decline across the lifespan. Method: Participants were 7,176 responders to a web-based ES study (age range = 10–96 years old). Results: Higher GAD-7 scores were associated with poorer ES performance for all emotion categories (happiness, anger, fear). The relationship between GAD-7 and ES scores remained significant after controlling for the effects of age and sex, and there was no significant interaction, indicating that the relationship does not change across age. Age significantly predicted ES and GAD-7 scores across emotions, with older ages showing lower ES scores and lower anxiety. Conclusions: In the largest study of its kind, GAD symptoms were associated with impaired ES performance across three emotion types. Future research should explore the connection between anxiety symptoms, cognitive processing, and social processing to better characterize the mechanisms of how GAD is linked with both social and non-social information processing. Future work may also look at if ES is related over time to changes in anxiety, making it a promising target for intervention. © 2019 The Authors.

Nevertheless, the impact of IQ differences is not usually considered in studies that  compared the cognitive functioning of children with and without epilepsy. This study  aimed to determine the effect of using IQ as a covariate on memory and  attentional/executive functions of children with TLE. METHODS: Thirty-eight children  and adolescents with TLE and 28 healthy controls paired as to age, gender, and  sociodemographic factors were evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological  battery for memory and executive functions. The authors conducted three analyses to  verify the impact of IQ scores on the other cognitive domains. First, we compared  performance on cognitive tests without controlling for IQ differences between  groups. Second, we performed the same analyses, but we included IQ as a confounding  factor. Finally, we evaluated the predictive value of IQ on cognitive functioning.  RESULTS: Although patients had IQ score in the normal range, they showed lower IQ  scores than controls (p = 0.001). When we did not consider IQ in the analyses,  patients had worse performance in verbal and visual memory (short and long-term),  semantic memory, sustained, divided and selective attention, mental flexibility and  mental tracking for semantic information. By using IQ as a covariate, patients  showed worse performance only in verbal memory (long-term), semantic memory,  sustained and divided attention and in mental flexibility. IQ was a predictor factor  of verbal and visual memory (immediate and delayed), working memory, mental  flexibility and mental tracking for semantic information. CONCLUSION: Intelligence  level had a significant impact on memory and executive functioning of children and  adolescents with TLE without intellectual disability.

In the speech stream boundaries of major syntactic constituents are reliably marked by prosodic cues. Therefore, prosodic information provides an important cue for discovering the syntactic structure of a language [Jusczyk, P.W., 2002. How infants adapt speech-processing capacities to native language structure. Curr. Dir. Psychol. Sci. 11, 15-18.]. Following this, the question is, whether children with SLI differ in the processing of syntactic information from normally developing children and to what extent this is related to the processing of the inherent prosodic information. Children heard either correct sentences or sentences with a word category violation (syntactic level) and a joined prosodic incongruity (prosodic level) while event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Judging the sentence's correctness, control children performed better than children with SLI for all types of sentences. With respect to the ERPs, control children showed a bilateral early starting anterior negativity sustaining into a late anterior negativity and a P600 in posterior regions in response to incorrect sentences. Children with SLI showed a comparable P600 but unlike the control children there was only a late, clearly left lateralized anterior negativity. The complete absence of a right anterior negativity in children with SLI suggests that they may not access prosodic information in the same way normal children do. The differences in prosodic processing may in turn hamper the development of syntactic processing skills as indicated by the absence of the syntax-related early left anterior negativity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies and assessed risk of bias. We used a random-effects model for meta-analysis. We rated the quality of the evidence according to the GRADE approach. Main results: We included three trials (590 participants). One single-site trial included 27 children; another multicenter trial (three countries) recruited 155 adults, the third trial was conducted in 24 countries, and recruited 408 adolescents and adults. Each study compared DC combined with standard care (this could include induced barbiturate coma or cooling of the brain, or both). All trials measured outcomes up to six months after injury; one also measured outcomes at 12 and 24 months (the latter data remain unpublished). All trials were at a high risk of bias for the criterion of performance bias, as neither participants nor personnel could be blinded to these interventions. The pediatric trial was at a high risk of selection bias and stopped early; another trial was at risk of bias because of atypical inclusion criteria and a change to the primary outcome after it had started. Mortality: pooled results for three studies provided moderate quality evidence that risk of death at six months was slightly reduced with DC (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.01; 3 studies, 571 participants; I2 = 38%; moderate-quality evidence), and one study also showed a clear reduction in risk of death at 12 months (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.76; 1 study, 373 participants; high-quality evidence). Neurological outcome: conscious of controversy around the traditional dichotomization of the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scale, we chose to present results in three ways, in order to contextualize factors relevant to clinical/patient decision-making. First, we present results of death in combination with vegetative status, versus other outcomes. Two studies reported results at six months for 544 participants. One employed a lower ICP threshold than the other studies, and showed an increase in the risk of death/vegetative state for the DC group. The other study used a more conventional ICP threshold, and results favoured the DC group (15.7% absolute risk reduction (ARR) (95% CI 6% to 25%). The number needed to treat for one beneficial outcome (NNTB) (i.e. to avoid death or vegetative status) was seven. The pooled result for DC compared with standard care showed no clear benefit for either group (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.13; 2 studies, 544 participants; I2 = 86%; low-quality evidence). One study reported data for this outcome at 12 months, when the risk for death or vegetative state was clearly reduced by DC compared with medical treatment (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.86; 1 study, 373 participants; high-quality evidence). Second, we assessed the risk of an 'unfavorable outcome' evaluated on a non-traditional dichotomized GOS-Extended scale (GOS-E), that is, grouping the category 'upper severe disability' into the 'good outcome' grouping. Data were available for two studies (n = 571). Pooling indicated little difference between DC and standard care regarding the risk of an unfavorable outcome at six months following injury (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.63; 544 participants); heterogeneity was high, with an I2 value of 82%. One trial reported data at 12 months and indicated a clear benefit of DC (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.95; 373 participants). Third, we assessed the risk of an 'unfavorable outcome' using the (traditional) dichotomized GOS/GOS-E cutoff into 'favorable' versus 'unfavorable' results. There was little difference between DC and standard care at six months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.40; 3 studies, 571 participants; low-quality evidence), and heterogeneity was high (I2 = 78%). At 12 months one trial suggested a similar finding (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09; 1 study, 373 participants; high-quality evidence). With regard to ICP reduction, pooled results for two studies provided moderate quality evidence that DC was superior to standard care for reducing ICP within 48 hours (MD −4.66 mmHg, 95% CI −6.86 to −2.45; 2 studies, 182 participants; I2 = 0%). Data from the third study were consistent with these, but could not be pooled. Data on adverse events are difficult to interpret, as mortality and complications are high, and it can be difficult to distinguish between treatment-related adverse events and the natural evolution of the condition. In general, there was low-quality evidence that surgical patients experienced a higher risk of adverse events. Authors' conclusions: Decompressive craniectomy holds promise of reduced mortality, but the effects of long-term neurological outcome remain controversial, and involve an examination of the priorities of participants and their families. Future research should focus on identifying clinical and neuroimaging characteristics to identify those patients who would survive with an acceptable quality of life; the best timing for DC; the most appropriate surgical techniques; and whether some synergistic treatments used with DC might improve patient outcomes.

We aimed to examine the neurobiological basis of this difference using functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. We compared 12 children with high functioning autism (HFA) to 12 age- and IQ-matched typically developing controls (CTRL) on a pictorial reasoning paradigm under three conditions: V, requiring visuospatial processing; S, requiring language (i.e., semantic) processing; and V+S, a hybrid condition in which language use could facilitate visuospatial transformations. Activated areas in the brain were chosen as endpoints for probabilistic diffusion tractography to examine tract integrity (FA) within the structural network underlying the activation patterns. The two groups showed similar networks, with linguistic processing activating inferior frontal, superior and middle temporal, ventral visual, and temporo-parietal areas, whereas visuospatial processing activated occipital and inferior parietal cortices. However, HFA appeared to activate occipito-parietal and ventral temporal areas, whereas CTRL relied more on frontal and temporal language regions. The increased reliance on visuospatial abilities in HFA was supported by intact connections between the inferior parietal and the ventral temporal ROIs. In contrast, the inferior frontal region showed reduced connectivity to ventral temporal and middle temporal areas in this group, reflecting impaired activation of frontal language areas in autism. The HFA group's engagement of posterior brain regions along with its weak connections to frontal language areas suggest support for a reliance on visual mediation in autism, even in tasks of higher cognition. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Method: Using a two-channel NIRS arrangement, we measured changes in bilateral prefrontal blood oxygenation during a category version of the verbal fluency task (VFT) in 27 monozygotic twin pairs and 12 same-sex dizygotic twin pairs ages 5–17 years. We also assessed the participant's full-scale intelligence quotient (FIQ) and retrieved parental socioeconomic status (SES). Classical structured equation modeling was used to estimate the heritability. Results: The heritability of VFT-related brain activation was estimated to be 44% and 37% in the right and left prefrontal regions, respectively. We also identified a significant genetic contribution (74%) to FIQ, but did not to VFT task performance. Parental SES was not correlated with FIQ, task performance, or task-related prefrontal activation. Conclusions: This finding provides further evidence that variance in prefrontal function has a genetic component since childhood and highlights brain function, as measured by NIRS, as a promising candidate for endophenotyping neurodevelopmental disorders. © 2018 The Authors.

Methods: We recorded and simultaneously monitored several physiological parameters [voice-recording, electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG)] during blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in nine patients with reading epilepsy. Individually tailored language paradigms were used to induce and record habitual seizures inside the MRI scanner. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used for structural brain analysis. Reading-induced seizures occurred in six out of nine patients. Results: One patient experienced abundant orofacial reflex myocloni during silent reading in association with bilateral frontal or generalized epileptiform discharges. In a further five patients, symptoms were only elicited while reading aloud with self-indicated events. Consistent activation patterns in response to reading-induced myoclonic seizures were observed within left motor and premotor areas in five of these six patients, in the left striatum (n = 4), in mesiotemporal/limbic areas (n = 4), in Brodmann area 47 (n = 3), and thalamus (n = 2). These BOLD activations were overlapping or adjacent to areas physiologically activated during language and facial motor tasks. No subtle structural abnormalities common to all patients were identified using VBM, but one patient had a left temporal ischemic lesion. Discussion: Based on the findings, we hypothesize that reflex seizures occur in reading epilepsy when a critical mass of neurons are activated through a provoking stimulus within corticoreticular and corticocortical circuitry subserving normal functions. © 2008 International League Against Epilepsy.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,27,50,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Studies of mnemonic function in ASD suggest a profile of impaired episodic memory with relative preservation of semantic memory (at least in high-functioning individuals). Such a pattern is consistent with developmental hippocampal abnormality. However, imaging evidence for abnormality of the hippocampal formation in ASD is inconsistent. These inconsistencies led us to examine the memory profile of children with ASD and the relationship to structural abnormalities. A cohort of high-functioning individuals with ASD and matched controls completed a comprehensive neuropsychological memory battery and underwent magnetic resonance imaging for the purpose of voxel-based morphometric analyses. Correlations between cognitive/behavioural test scores and quantified results of brain scans were also carried out to further examine the role of the medial temporal lobe in ASD. A selective deficit in episodic memory with relative preservation of semantic memory was found. Voxel-based morphometry revealed bilateral abnormalities in several areas implicated in ASD including the hippocampal formation. A significant correlation was found between parental ratings reflecting autistic symptomatology and the measure of grey matter density in the junction area involving the amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. The data reveal a pattern of impaired and relatively preserved mnemonic function that is consistent with a hippocampal abnormality of developmental origin.

However, few studies in pediatrics have characterized specific psychiatric conditions associated with seizure localization. In addition, degree to which psychiatric illness may be more prominent in children refractory to standard medical treatment for epilepsy is not known. The aim of this study was to assess psychiatric symptoms in children with medically refractory epilepsy and ascertain whether symptoms were associated with specific localization. Methods Case records were reviewed for 40 children with medically refractory epilepsy at the time of their referral for presurgical evaluation. Patients received a clinical psychiatric evaluation and parents completed the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL). Seizure localization was verified by pediatric epileptologists, and suitability for surgical procedures was verified by neurosurgical specialists. Groups were compared based on localization of seizure foci, either in the temporal lobe or predominantly extratemporal. Key Findings The majority of the sample had psychiatric diagnoses and behavior problems, well beyond the level reported in chronic epilepsy populations. In addition, children with temporal lobe seizure foci had more CBCL behavioral problem categories rated in the clinically significant range, and also were more likely to have clinical diagnoses of depression. Significance Routine psychiatric evaluation prior to epilepsy surgery may be important for pediatric patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Psychiatric illness, particularly depression, may be especially prominent for those with temporal lobe seizure foci. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2013 International League Against Epilepsy.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,11.4,17,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

At the same time, a large number of special service units for early psychosis have been established around the world especially in Australia, USA, UK, Germany etc. Recently, similar units operate in Greece also. The Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association in its latest edition in 2013 (DSM-5), introduced the category 'Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome' (APS) for people with early psychotic experiences in the section: 'Conditions for further study'. This new category has specific criteria and describes a situation. In which a person displays psychotic symptoms in an attenuated form, with quite unaffected reality testing, but not qualifying a diagnosis of schizophrenic spectrum. The clinical expression of APS should be differentiated with several well known psychiatric disorders such as: brief psychotic disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, major depression with psychotic features, adolescence adjustment disorders, drug use, etc. The 'Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome' occurs mainly in adolescence and in young adulthood. The mean percentage of transition to psychosis for these individuals is estimated at 36%, three years after the onset of initial symptoms, while the risk of transition to psychosis, although smaller, seems to remain up to ten years later. For some other individuals, transition to other psychiatric disorders occurs, such as depression with psychotic elements, or bipolar disorder, while a significant number of them will not transmit to even more serious disorders. At the biological level, studies focused in brain's neuroimaging, suggest significant volumetric differences among people at high risk for psychosis who later develop psychosis compared to those who don't, while studies of psychophysiological indicators or/and genetic markers show promising results for the identification of relevant parameters indicating the transition to psychosis. Although an heterogeneous population, people with APS, show significant difficulties in social, professional and cognitive level, that should be therapeutically addressed. In an attempt to improve the clinical status of these individuals, to delay or even to prevent a psychotic episode, a series of Interventions have been used by psychiatrists. These interventions include: (a) administration of drugs, especially atypical antipsychotics or antidepressants in low dosage, (b) administration of non-pharmaceutical supplements (e.g. omega-3 ), (c) psychotherapeutic interventions, mainly cognitive behavior therapy and (d) a combination of the above. Many questions need to be answered such as, the period of therapeutic intervention, identification of indicators (biological or/and clinical) that may determine the most suited for the APS individuals therapeutic interventions or, that may foresee, to prevent the transition to psychosis. Thus, the continuation of research in populations of APS individuals in multiple levels is necessary.

Objective: To assess the effects of specific proactive semantic interference deficits as they relate to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neocortical and limbic functional connectivity in middle aged offspring of individuals with LOAD (O-LOAD) and age-equivalent controls. Methods:We examined 21O-LOADand 20 controls without family history of neurodegenerative disorders (CS) on traditional measures of cognitive functioning and the LASSI-L, a novel semantic interference test uniquely sensitive to the failure to recover from proactive interference (frPSI). Cognitive tests then were correlated to fMRI connectivity of seeds located in entorhinal cortex and anterodorsal thalamic nuclei among O-LOAD and CS participants. Results: Relative to CS, O-LOAD participants evidenced lower connectivity between entorhinal cortex and orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, and anterior temporal cortex. In the offspring of LOAD patients, LASSI-L measures of frPSI were inversely associated with connectivity between anterodorsal thalamus and contralateral posterior cingulate. Intrusions on the task related to frPSI were inversely correlated with a widespread connectivity network involving hippocampal, insular, posterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, along with precunei and anterior thalamus in this group. Different patterns of connectivity associated with frPSI were observed among controls.

Method: Thirty-five male patients (ranging from 0.7–43.5y at the first MRI) with PLP1-related disorder were prospectively followed over 7 years. Patients were classified according to best motor function acquired before 5 years (MDS) into five categories (from PMD0 without motor acquisition to PMD4 with autonomous walking). We determined myelination and atrophy scores and measured corpus callosum area, volume of cerebellum, white matter and grey matter on 63 MRI. Results: Age-adjusted multivariate analysis revealed that patients with PMD0-1 had higher-severity atrophy scores and smaller corpus callosum area than did patients with PMD2 and PMD3-4. Myelination score increased until 12 years. There was evidence that the mean myelination differed in frontal white matter, arcuate fibres, and internal capsules among the groups. Most patients showed worsening atrophy (brain, cerebellum, corpus callosum), whereas grey matter and white matter proportions did not change. Interpretation: Brain atrophy and myelination of anterior cerebral regions appear to be pertinent biomarkers of motor development. The time-course of inter- and intra-individual cerebral white matter and grey matter atrophy suggests that both oligodendrocytes and neurons are involved in the physiopathology of PLP1-related disorders. © 2016 Mac Keith Press",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,17,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Our aims are: to provide a subcortical atlas of human brain functions; to  elucidate the functional roles of different bundles; to provide a probabilistic  resection map of WM. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied 130 patients who underwent  awake surgery for gliomas (82 left; 48 right) with electrostimulation mapping at  cortical and subcortical levels. Different aspects of language, sensori-motor,  spatial cognition, and visual functions were monitored. 339 regions of interest  (ROIs) including the functional response errors collected during stimulation were  co-registered in the MNI space, as well as the resections' areas and residual  tumors. Functional response errors and resection areas were matched with DTI and  cortical atlases. Subcortical maps for each function and a probability map of  resection were computed. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: The medial part of dorsal stream  (arcuate fasciculus) subserves phonological processing; its lateral part [indirect  anterior portion of the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF)] subserves speech  planning. The ventral stream subserves language semantics and matches with the  inferior fronto-occipital fascicle. Reading deficits match with the inferior  longitudinal fascicle. Anomias match with the indirect posterior portion of the SLF.  Frontal WM underpins motor planning and execution. Right parietal WM subserves  spatial cognition.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy offers the possibility to measure brain activity during verbal fluency in psychiatric patients due to low susceptibility to movements artefacts. Fourteen patients with mainly combined ADHD subtype and 14 healthy controls matched for age, gender, handedness, education level, and intelligence showed equal performance in phonological verbal fluency and higher performance in semantical verbal fluency in comparison to the controls. On the level of brain function indicated by concentration changes of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin, both groups showed inferior frontal brain activity during both tasks. ADHD patients had a lower magnitude of oxygenation and a significant negative correlation of brain activity with performance, i.e. higher brain activity was associated with lower performance.

Design: A computerized literature search was conducted, and other sources, such as textbooks, were searched. Results: Many categories of sleep related disorders were represented in the classification: parasomnias (confusional arousals/sleepwalking, with or without obstructive sleep apnea; REM sleep behavior disorder); sleep related seizures; Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS); severe chronic insomnia; restless legs syndrome; narcolepsy; sleep exacerbation of persistent sexual arousal syndrome; sleep related painful erections; sleep related dissociative disorders; nocturnal psychotic disorders; miscellaneous states. Kleine-Levin syndrome (78 cases) and parasomnias (31 cases) were most frequently reported. Parasomnias and sleep related seizures had overlapping and divergent clinical features. Thirty-one cases of parasomnias (25 males; mean age, 32 years) and 7 cases of sleep related seizures (4 males; mean age, 38 years) were identified. A full range of sleep related sexual behaviors with self and/or bed partners or others were reported, including masturbation, sexual vocalizations, fondling, sexual intercourse with climax, sexual assault/rape, ictal sexual hyperarousal, ictal orgasm, and ictal automatism. Adverse physical and/or psychosocial effects from the sleepsex were present in all parasomnia and sleep related seizure cases, but pleasurable effects were reported by 5 bed partners and by 3 patients with sleep related seizures. Forensic consequences were common, occurring in 35.5% (11/31) of parasomnia cases, with most (9/11) involving minors. All parasomnias cases reported amnesia for the sleep-sex, in contrast to 28.6% (2/7) of sleep related seizure cases. Polysomnography (without penile tumescence monitoring), performed in 26 of 31 parasomnia cases, documented sexual moaning from slow wave sleep in 3 cases and sexual intercourse during stage 1 sleep/wakefulness in one case (with sex provoked by the bed partner). Confusional arousals (CAs) were diagnosed as the cause of 'sleepsex' (""sexsomnia"") in 26 cases (with obstructive sleep apnea [OSA] comorbidity in 4 cases), and sleepwalking in 2 cases, totaling 90.3% (28/31) of cases being NREM sleep parasomnias. REM behavior disorder was the presumed cause in the other 3 cases. Bedtime clonazepam therapy was effective in 90% (9/10) of treated parasomnia cases; nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy was effective in controlling comorbid OSA and CAs in both treated cases. All five treated patients with sleep related sexual seizures responded to anticonvulsant therapy. The hypersexuality in KLS, which was twice as common in males compared to females, had no reported effective therapy.

Previous studies have suggested that stimuli that encourage semantic grouping strategies had modulating effects on specific ERP components. However, these studies did not differentiate between ERP activation patterns evoked by elaborative working memory strategies like semantic grouping and more simple strategies like rote rehearsal. Identification of neurocognitive correlates underlying successful use of elaborative strategies is important to understand better why certain populations, like children or elderly people, have problems applying such strategies. To compare ERP activation during the application of elaborative versus more simple strategies subjects had to encode either four semantically related or unrelated pictures by respectively applying a semantic category grouping or a simple rehearsal strategy. Another goal was to investigate if maintenance of semantically grouped vs. ungrouped pictures modulated ERP-slow waves differently. At the behavioral level there was only a semantic grouping benefit in terms of faster responding on correct rejections (i.e. when the memory probe stimulus was not part of the memory set). At the neural level, during encoding semantic grouping only had a modest specific modulatory effect on a fronto-central Late Positive Component (LPC), emerging around 650. ms. Other ERP components (i.e. P200, N400 and a second Late Positive Component) that had been earlier related to semantic grouping encoding processes now showed stronger modulation by rehearsal than by semantic grouping. During maintenance semantic grouping had specific modulatory effects on left and right frontal slow wave activity. These results stress the importance of careful control of strategy use when investigating the neural correlates of elaborative encoding. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,20.1,25,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Possible differences in the neuroanatomical correlates of intelligence and their developmental trajectories between boys and girls were investigated using functional MRI (fMRI). A large cohort of over 300 children, ages 5-18, performed the semantic processing task of silent verb generation. Regions were found in the left hemisphere exhibiting positive correlations of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activation with IQ, including the middle temporal gyrus, prefrontal cortex (Broca's area), medial frontal gyrus, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus, while the superior temporal gyrus in the right hemisphere displayed a negative correlation of BOLD activation with IQ. Significant sex-X-IQ and sex-X-IQ-X-age interaction effects were also seen in the left middle temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus. Using a data-driven analysis procedure, a sex-X-IQ-X-age interaction was also demonstrated in the functional connectivity between regions in the left hemisphere, parameterized as a weighted sum of pairwise covariances between fMRI time courses. While young girls (<13 years) exhibited no correlation of connectivity with intelligence, older girls (>13 years) demonstrated a positive association of functional connectivity with intelligence. Boys, however, demonstrated the opposite developmental trajectory, from a positive association of connectivity with intelligence in young boys (ages <9 years), to a negative association in older boys (ages >13 years).

We  investigate the correlation of white matter microstructure with various higher-order  auditory processing tasks, including interpretation of speech-in-noise, recognition  of low-pass frequency filtered words, and interpretation of time-compressed  sentences at two different values of compression. These tests are typically used to  diagnose auditory processing disorder (APD) in children. Our hypothesis is that  correlations between white matter microstructure in tracts connecting the temporal,  frontal, and parietal lobes, as well as callosal pathways, will be seen. Previous  functional imaging studies have shown correlations between activation in temporal,  frontal, and parietal regions from higher-order auditory processing tasks. In  addition, we hypothesize that the regions displaying correlations will vary  according to the task because each task uses a different set of skills. DESIGN:  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired from a cohort of 17 normal-hearing  children aged 9 to 11 yrs. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of white matter  fiber tract integrity and organization, was computed and correlated on a voxelwise  basis with performance on the auditory processing tasks, controlling for age, sex,  and full-scale IQ. RESULTS: Divergent correlations of white matter FA depending on  the particular auditory processing task were found. Positive correlations were found  between FA and speech-in-noise in white matter adjoining prefrontal areas and  between FA and filtered words in the corpus callosum. Regions exhibiting  correlations with time-compressed sentences varied depending on the degree of  compression: the greater degree of compression (with the greatest difficulty)  resulted in correlations in white matter adjoining prefrontal (dorsal and ventral),  whereas the smaller degree of compression (with less difficulty) resulted in  correlations in white matter adjoining audiovisual association areas and the  posterior cingulate. Only the time-compressed sentences with the lowest degree of  compression resulted in positive correlations in the centrum semiovale; all the  other tasks resulted in negative correlations. CONCLUSIONS: The dependence of  performance on higher-order auditory processing tasks on brain anatomical  connectivity was seen in normal-hearing children aged 9 to 11 yrs. Results support a  previously hypothesized dual-stream (dorsal and ventral) model of auditory  processing, and that higher-order processing tasks rely less on the dorsal stream  related to articulatory networks and more on the ventral stream related to semantic  comprehension. Results also show that the regions correlating with auditory  processing vary according to the specific task, indicating that the neurological  bases for the various tests used to diagnose APD in children may be partially  independent.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,10.17,11,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

This co-reference could be established, among other ways, by using (i) conceptual/semantic information (biological gender agreement between the pronoun and its referent), (ii) syntactic information (syntactic gender agreement), or (iii) both. This event-related brain potential (ERP) study assesses this interplay of syntactic and semantic information. We focussed on the N400 component, related to semantic integration, and the SPS/P600 component, related to syntactic reanalysis. The study was conducted in German, because its rich syntactic gender system offers a means to dissociate between biological (MALE/FEMALE) and syntactic gender (masculine/feminine/neuter), especially in the case of diminutives (dasneuter BübchenMALE [the little boy]). German subjects read sentences in which a referent (BübchenMALE-neuter/BubMALE-masculine [boy]) was introduced. Later a personal pronoun was presented which either agreed with the referent in terms of syntactic gender, or in terms of biological gender, or both, or violated both agreements. Overall, results showed salient P600 effects for pronouns. This indicates that the establishment of reference involves syntactic reanalysis. Furthermore, we observed N400 effects in sentences with non-diminutives, but not with diminutives. This shows that conceptual/semantic integration is involved during non-diminutive but not during diminutive pronoun processing, or at least it could not be violated. The overall pattern of results supports the claim that for non-diminutives, both syntactic and conceptual information is used to establish co-reference, while for diminutives the process might be purely syntactically driven. © Elsevier Science B.V.

The fMRI paradigm consisted in judging if a series of adjectives applied to the participant himself/herself (self), to his/her best friend or to a fictional character (Harry Potter). In control adolescents, we observed that self- and other-related processing elicited strong activation in cortical midline structures (CMS) when contrasted with a semantic baseline condition. 22q11DS exhibited hypoactivation in the CMS and the striatum during the processing of self-related information when compared to the control group. Finally, the hypoactivation in the anterior cingulate cortex was associated with the severity of prodromal positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

Activation of the FFA to a  task without faces challenges the received view that the FFA is restricted in its  activities to the perception of faces.

Here we investigated the neural correlates of encoding and maintaining in working memory above–below and left–right relational planes in 12 adults using magnetoencephalography in order to discover whether above–below relations are represented by the brain differently than left–right relations. Adults performed perfectly on the task behaviorally, so any differences in neural activity were attributed to the stimuli’s cognitive attributes. In comparing above–below to left–right relations during stimulus encoding, we found the greatest differences in neural activity in areas associated with space and movement. In comparing congruent to incongruent trials, we found the greatest differential activity in premotor areas. For both contrasts, brain areas involved in the encoding phase were also involved in the maintenance phase, which provides evidence that those brain areas are particularly important in representing the relational planes or congruency types throughout the trial. When comparing neural activity associated with the relational planes during working memory, additional right posterior areas were implicated, whereas the congruent-incongruent contrast implicated additional bilateral frontal and temporal areas.

All subjects (N = 8) participated in one proton echo planar spectroscopic imaging (PEPSI) and one functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session that required phonological and lexical judgments to aurally presented stimuli. Valid PEPSI data was limited in the frontal areas of the brain due to the magnetic susceptibility of the eye orbits and frontal sinuses. Findings from the remainder of the brain indicate that subjects show a significant consistency across imaging techniques in the left temporal area during the lexical task, but not in any other measurable area or during the phonological task. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,exclude,NaN,13,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The cerebellum is nearly always affected in PMM2-CDG patients, a cerebellar atrophy progression is observed, and cerebellar dysfunction is their main daily functional limitation. Different therapeutic agents are under development, and clinical evaluation of drug candidates will require a standardized score of cerebellar dysfunction. We aim to assess the validity of the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) in children and adolescents with genetically confirmed PMM2-CDG deficiency. We compare ICARS results with the Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS), neuroimaging, intelligence quotient (IQ) and molecular data. Methods: Our observational study included 13 PMM2-CDG patients and 21 control subjects. Ethical permissions and informed consents were obtained. Three independent child neurologists rated PMM2-CDG patients and control subjects using the ICARS. A single clinician administered the NPCRS. All patients underwent brain MRI, and the relative diameter of the midsagittal vermis was measured. Psychometric evaluations were available in six patients. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare ICARS between patients and controls. To evaluate inter-observer agreement in patients' ICARS ratings, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. ICARS internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient test was used to correlate ICARS with NPCRS, midsagittal vermis relative diameter and IQ. Results: ICARS and ICARS subscores differed between patients and controls (p &lt; 0.001). Interobserver agreement of ICARS was ""almost perfect"" (ICC = 0.99), with a ""good"" internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.72). ICARS was significantly correlated with the total NPCRS score (rs 0.90, p &lt; 0.001). However, there was no agreement regarding categories of severity. Regarding neuroimaging, inverse correlations between ICARS and midsagittal vermis relative diameter (rs -0.85, p = 0.003) and IQ (rs -0.94, p = 0.005) were found. Patients bearing p.E93A, p.C241S or p.R162W mutations presented a milder phenotype. Conclusions: ICARS is a reliable instrument for assessment of PMM2-CDG patients, without significant inter-rater variability. Despite our limited sample size, the results show a good correlation between functional cerebellar assessment, IQ and neuroimagingFor the first a correlation between ICARS, neuroimaging and IQ in PMM2-CDG patients has been demonstrated. © 2015 Serrano et al.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,8.41,15,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Cardiac-gated balanced steady-state free-precession technique, which has recently been shown to demonstrate the pulsatile motion of neural structures, appears well suited to allow direct measurement of craniocaudal translation of cerebellar tonsils during the cardiac cycle. Our aim was to assess the intra-observer and inter-observer variability in the assessment of tonsillar motion utilizing this technique. Methods We retrospectively identified 44 patients who had undergone MR imaging with cine TrueFISP sequence, as a part of CSF flow study. Two neuroradiologists independently assessed the images. The tonsillar pulsatility was subjectively characterized into none, minimal, and marked categories after review of the images on a cine loop. For patients with identifiable tonsillar motion, the maximal extent of translation of the inferior edge of the cerebellar tonsil was directly measured. Both readers repeated the measurements after a minimum interval of 2 weeks. Intra- and inter-observer variability was characterized by calculating the kappa statistics. Results The intra-observer agreement for subjective assessment of tonsillar pulsatility was near perfect while the interobserver agreement was substantial. A good intra- and inter-observer correlation was also seen for the objective measurements of the tonsillar motion. A good correlation was found between the subjective categorization of the tonsillar pulsatility and the objective measurements. Conclusion Steady-state balanced free-precession MR imaging technique allows for a reproducible subjective and objective assessment of tonsillar pulsatility. © Springer-Verlag 2011.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,11.5,35,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

To make sense of those experiences, knowledge about the world and oneself must also exist in a form that is free of context - known as semantic memory.

Bronchiolitis is a common indication for PICU admission among children less than 2 years old. Two single-center studies suggest that greater than 10-25% of critical bronchiolitis survivors have neurologic and functional morbidity but those estimates are 20 years old. We aimed to estimate the burden of neurologic and functional morbidity among more recent bronchiolitis patients using two large, multicenter databases. Design: Analysis of the Pediatric Health Information System and the Virtual Pediatric databases. Setting: Forty-eight U.S. children's hospitals (Pediatric Health Information System) and 40 international (mostly United States) children's hospitals (Virtual Pediatric Systems). Patients: Previously healthy PICU patients less than 2 years old admitted with bronchiolitis between 2009 and 2015 who survived and did not require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Interventions: None. Neurologic and functional morbidity was defined as a Pediatric Overall Performance Category greater than 1 at PICU discharge (Virtual Pediatric Systems subjects), or a subsequent hospital encounter involving developmental delay, feeding tubes, MRI of the brain, neurologist evaluation, or rehabilitation services (Pediatric Health Information System subjects). Measurements and Main Results: Among 3,751 Virtual Pediatric Systems subjects and 9,516 Pediatric Health Information System subjects, ∼20% of patients received mechanical ventilation. Evidence of neurologic and functional morbidity was present at PICU discharge in 707 Virtual Pediatric Systems subjects (18.6%) and more chronically in 1,104 Pediatric Health Information System subjects (11.6%). In both cohorts, neurologic and functional morbidity was more common in subjects receiving mechanical ventilation (27.5% vs 16.5% in Virtual Pediatric Systems; 14.5% vs 11.1% in Pediatric Health Information System; both p < 0.001). In multivariate models also including demographics, use of mechanical ventilation was the only variable that was associated with increased neurologic and functional morbidity in both cohorts. Conclusions: In two large, multicenter databases, neurologic and functional morbidity was common among previously healthy children admitted to the PICU with bronchiolitis. Prospective studies are needed to measure neurologic and functional outcomes using more precise metrics. Identification of modifiable risk factors may subsequently lead to improved outcomes from this common PICU condition.

However, it remains unclear whether visual cortical participation reflects isolated processing within posterior regions or functional cooperation with distal brain regions, such as left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). We addressed this question using functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) and structural equation modeling in 14 adolescents and adults with ASD and 14 matched typically developing (TD) participants. Data were analyzed to isolate low-frequency intrinsic fluctuations, by regressing out effects of a semantic decision task. For a right extrastriate seed derived from the strongest cluster of atypical activation in the ASD group, widespread effects of increased connectivity in prefrontal and medial frontal lobes bilaterally were observed for the ASD group, compared to the TD group. A second analysis for a seed in LIFG, derived from pooled activation effects in both groups, also yielded widespread effects of overconnectivity in the ASD group, especially in temporal lobes. Structural equation modeling showed that whereas right extrastriate cortex did not impact function of language regions (left and right IFG, left middle temporal gyrus) in the TD model, it was an integral part of a language circuit in the ASD group. These results suggest that atypical extrastriate activation during language processing in ASD reflects integrative (not isolated) processing. Furthermore, our findings are inconsistent with previous reports of functional underconnectivity in ASD, probably related to removal of task effects required to isolate intrinsic low-frequency fluctuations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,24.4,42,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Some studies have found similar behavior for numerals and quantifiers, whereas others have shown critical differences. It is, therefore, debated whether they are processed in the same way. A previous fMRI investigation showed that the left inferior frontal gyrus is linked to the computation of the strong interpretation of quantifiers (derived by a scalar implicature) and that the left middle frontal gyrus and the medial frontal gyrus are linked to processing the mismatch between the strong interpretation of quantifiers and the context in which they are presented. In the current study, we attempted to characterize the similarities and differences between numbers and quantifiers by examining brain activation patterns related to the processing of numerals in these brain regions. When numbers were presented in a mismatch context (i.e., where their strong interpretation did not match the context), they elicited brain activations similar to those previously observed with quantifiers in the same context type. Conversely, in a match context (i.e., where both interpretations of the scalar item matched the context), numbers elicited a different activation pattern than the one observed with quantifiers: Left inferior frontal gyrus activations in response to the match condition showed decrease for numbers (but not for quantifiers). Our results support previous findings suggesting that, although they share some features, numbers and quantifiers are processed differently. We discuss our results in light of various theoretical approaches linked to the representation of numerals.

For example, adults usually interpret some as  some but not all. On the basis of behavioral research, it has been suggested that  processing implicatures is cognitively costly. However, many studies have used cases  where sentences with some did not match the context in which they were presented.  Our study aimed to examine whether the processing cost is linked to implicature  generation, to the mismatch between the implicature and the context, or to both  processes. To do so, we explored the neural patterns of implicature generation and  implicature mismatch using fMRI. Thirteen participants performed a sentence-picture  matching task (where pictures determined the context) with mismatched implicatures,  successful implicatures or no implicature conditions. Several brain regions were  identified when comparing cases of implicature mismatch and cases without  implicatures. One of these regions, left-IFG, was jointly activated for mismatched  and successful implicatures, as observed in a conjunction analysis. By contrast,  left-MFG and medial-frontal-gyrus, were identified when comparing cases of  implicature mismatch with cases of successful implicatures. Thus, the left IFG can  be interpreted as being linked to implicature generation, whereas the other two  areas seem to participate in the processing of the mismatch between the implicature  and its context. Our results indicate that scalar implicatures induce processing  cost in different ways. This should be considered in future research.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,23.4,30,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

These findings raise the question of whether the FG is indeed sensitive to  faces or to the more abstract category of animate agents. The current study uses  fMRI to examine whether the FG responds to all faces in a category-specific way or  whether the FG is especially sensitive to the faces of animate agents. Animate  agents are defined here as intentional agents with the capacity for rational  goal-directed actions. Specifically, we examine how the FG responds to an entity  that looks like an animate agent but that lacks the capacity for goal-directed  rational action. Region-of-interest analyses reveal that the FG activates more  strongly to the animate compared with the inanimate entity, even though the surface  features of both animate and inanimate entities were identical. These results  suggest that the FG does not respond to all faces in a category-specific way, and is  instead especially sensitive to whether an entity is animate.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,25.2,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Several imaging methods were assessed in a study of 40 children with traumatic brain injury: computed tomography (CT), T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI, and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) MRI to determine which were most valuable in predicting 6-12 month outcomes as classified by the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale score. Patients were subdivided into three groups: (1) normal, (2) mild disability, and (3) moderate/severe disability/persistent vegetative state. T2, FLAIR, and SWI showed no significant difference in lesion volume between normal and mild outcome groups, but did indicate significant differences between normal and poor and between mild and poor outcome groups. Computed tomography revealed no significant differences in lesion volume between any groups. The findings suggest that T2, FLAIR, and SWI MRI sequences provide a more accurate assessment of injury severity and detection of outcome-influencing lesions than does CT in pediatric traumatic brain injury patients. Although CT was inconsistent at lesion detection/outcome prediction, it remains an essential part of the acute traumatic brain injury work-up to assess the need for neurosurgic intervention. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

An event-related brain potential study of preschoolers using jabberwocky sentences,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2007.19.6.1050,"Behavioral studies have demonstrated that children develop a nearly adult-like grammar between 36 and 42 months, but few studies have addressed how the child's brain processes semantic versus syntactic information. In previous research, Silva-Pereyra and colleagues showed that distinct event-related potentials (ERPs) are elicited by semantic and syntactic violations in sentences in children as young as 30, 36, and 48 months, following the patterns displayed by adults. In the current study, we examined ERPs to syntactic phrase structure violations in real and jabberwocky sentences in 36-month-old children. Jabberwocky sentences are sentences in which content (open-class) words are replaced by pseudowords while function (closed-class) words are retained. Results showed that syntactically anomalous real sentences elicited two positive ERP effects: left-distributed effects from 500 to 750 msec and 1050 to 1300 msec, whereas syntactically anomalous jabberwocky sentences elicited two negative ERP effects: a left-distributed effect from 750 to 900 msec and a later broadly distributed effect from 950 to 1150 msec. The results indicate that when preschoolers process real English sentences, ERPs resembling the positive effects previously reported for adults are noted, although at longer latencies and with broader scalp distributions. However, when preschoolers process jabberwocky sentences with altered lexical-semantic content, a negative-going ERP component similar to one typically associated with the extraction of meaning is noted. © 2007 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,3,2,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

However, it remains unclear whether this dysfunction is specific to schizophrenia or can be continuously observed across persons with different levels of nonclinical and clinical symptom expression. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether the pattern of reward system dysfunction is consistent with a dimensional or categorical model of psychosis-like symptom expression. 23 patients with schizophrenia and 37 healthy control participants with varying levels of psychosis-like symptoms, separated into 3 groups of low, medium, and high symptom expression underwent event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a Cued Reinforcement Reaction Time task. We observed lower activation in the ventral striatum during the expectation of high vs no reward to be associated with higher symptom expression across all participants. No significant difference between patients with schizophrenia and healthy participants with high symptom expression was found. However, connectivity between the ventral striatum and the medial orbitofrontal cortex was specifically reduced in patients with schizophrenia. Dysfunctional local activation of the ventral striatum depends less on diagnostic category than on the degree of symptom expression, therefore showing a pattern consistent with a psychosis continuum. In contrast, aberrant connectivity in the reward system is specific to patients with schizophrenia, thereby supporting a categorical view. Thus, the results of the present study provide evidence for both continuous and discontinuous neural substrates of symptom expression across patients with schizophrenia and the general population.

Broca's area has been assumed to play an important role both in semantic retrieval or selection (as part of a language comprehension system) and in action recognition (as part of a ""mirror"" or ""observation-execution matching"" system). We asked whether the role that Broca's area plays in processing speech-associated gestures is consistent with the semantic retrieval/selection account (predicting relatively weak interactions between Broca's area and other cortical areas because the meaningful information that speech-associated gestures convey reduces semantic ambiguity and thus reduces the need for semantic retrieval/selection) or the action recognition account (predicting strong interactions between Broca's area and other cortical areas because speech-associated gestures are goal-direct actions that are ""mirrored""). We compared the functional connectivity of Broca's area with other cortical areas when participants listened to stories while watching meaningful speech-associated gestures, speech-irrelevant self-grooming hand movements, or no hand movements. A network analysis of neuroimaging data showed that interactions involving Broca's area and other cortical areas were weakest when spoken language was accompanied by meaningful speech-associated gestures, and strongest when spoken language was accompanied by self-grooming hand movements or by no hand movements at all.

Surgical resection for medication-resistant and well-localized temporal lobe epilepsy has good prognosis for seizure freedom, but is linked to memory difficulties in adults, especially when the removal is on the left side. Children may benefit most from surgery, because brain plasticity may facilitate post-surgical reorganization, and seizure cessation may promote cognitive development. However, the long-term impact of this intervention in children is not known. We examined memory function in 53 children (25 males, 28 females) who were evaluated for epilepsy surgery: 42 underwent unilateral temporal lobe resections (25 left, 17 right, mean age at surgery 13.8 years), 11 were treated only pharmacologically. Average follow-up was 9 years (range 5-15). Post-surgical change in visual and verbal episodic memory, and semantic memory at follow-up were examined. Pre- and post-surgical T1-weighted MRI brain scans were analysed to extract hippocampal and resection volumes, and evaluate post-surgical temporal lobe integrity. Language lateralization indices were derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging. There were no significant pre- to postoperative decrements in memory associated with surgery. In contrast, gains in verbal episodic memory were seen after right temporal lobe surgery, and visual episodic memory improved after left temporal lobe surgery, indicating a functional release in the unoperated temporal lobe after seizure reduction or cessation. Pre- to post-surgical change in memory function was not associated with any indices of brain structure derived from MRI. However, better verbal memory at follow-up was linked to greater post-surgical residual hippocampal volumes, most robustly in left surgical participants. Better semantic memory at follow-up was associated with smaller resection volumes and greater temporal pole integrity after left temporal surgery. Results were independent of post-surgical intellectual function and language lateralization. Our findings indicate post-surgical, hemisphere-dependent material-specific improvement in memory functions in the intact temporal lobe. However, outcome was linked to the anatomical integrity of the temporal lobe memory system, indicating that compensatory mechanisms are constrained by the amount of tissue which remains in the operated temporal lobe. Careful tailoring of resections for children undergoing epilepsy surgery may enhance long-term memory outcome. © The Author (2014).

Clinical factors such as seizure cessation or antiepileptic medication discontinuation have been implicated, but do not fully account for the heterogeneity seen. Less is known about the impact of neurobiological factors, such as brain development and resection location. This study examines clinical and neuroimaging factors associated with cognitive outcome after epilepsy surgery in childhood. Methods: Fifty-two children (28 boys, 24 girls) were evaluated for epilepsy surgery and reassessed on average 7.7 years later. In the intervening time, 13 were treated pharmacologically and 39 underwent focal surgery (17 temporal, 16 extratemporal, six multilobar; mean age at surgery = 14.0 years). Pre- and postsurgical assessments included IQ tests and T1-weighted brain images. Predictors of IQ change were investigated, including voxel-based analyses of resection location, and gray and white matter volume change. Results: Overall modest IQ improvement was seen in children treated surgically, but not in those treated pharmacologically only. Applying a ≥10-point change threshold, 39% of the surgically treated children improved, whereas 10% declined. Clinical factors associated with IQ increases were lower preoperative IQ and longer follow-up duration, whereas seizure and antiepileptic medication cessation were not predictive. Among neuroimaging factors, we observed that left anterior temporal resections impacted negatively on verbal reasoning, linked to full-scale IQ decline. In contrast, gray matter volume change in ipsi- and contralesional hemispheres was positively correlated with IQ change. Voxel-based morphometry identified the gray matter volume change in the contralesional dorsolateral frontal cortex as most strongly associated with IQ improvement. Significance: We show that a variety of factors are likely to contribute to patterns of postsurgical change in IQ. Neuroimaging results indicate that left anterior temporal resections constrain development of verbal cognition, whereas simultaneously cortical growth after surgical treatment can support improvements in IQ.

The participants watched simple written sentences while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. At the end of each sentence they were asked to judge whether the sentence was correct or not. Two types of violations were introduced in the middle of the sentence: a semantically implausible noun or a violation of subject-verb number agreement. Results: The results showed a similar ERP pattern after semantic violations (an N400 followed by a positivity) in all three groups. After syntactic violations, native German speakers and native signers of German sign language (DGS) with German as second language (L2) showed a left anterior negativity (LAN) followed by a P600, whereas no LAN but a negativity over the right hemisphere instead was found in deaf participants with a delayed onset of first language (L1) acquisition. The P600 of this group had a smaller amplitude and a different scalp distribution as compared to German native speakers. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that language deprivation in early childhood alters the cerebral organization of syntactic language processing mechanisms for L2. Semantic language processing instead was unaffected. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,31,53,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Application of new analytical approaches can help translate the improved understanding of early functional connectivity provided through these studies into predictive models of neurodevelopmental outcome. One approach to achieving this goal is multivariate pattern analysis, a machine-learning, pattern classification approach well-suited for high-dimensional neuroimaging data. It has previously been adapted to predict brain maturity in children and adolescents using structural and resting state-functional MRI data. In this study, we evaluated resting state-functional MRI data from 50 preterm-born infants (born at 23-29 weeks of gestation and without moderate-severe brain injury) scanned at term equivalent postmenstrual age compared with data from 50 term-born control infants studied within the first week of life. Using 214 regions of interest, binary support vector machines distinguished term from preterm infants with 84% accuracy (p < 0.0001). Inter- and intra-hemispheric connections throughout the brain were important for group categorization, indicating that widespread changes in the brain's functional network architecture associated with preterm birth are detectable by term equivalent age. Support vector regression enabled quantitative estimation of birth gestational age in single subjects using only term equivalent resting state-functional MRI data, indicating that the present approach is sensitive to the degree of disruption of brain development associated with preterm birth (using gestational age as a surrogate for the extent of disruption). This suggests that support vector regression may provide a means for predicting neurodevelopmental outcome in individual infants. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,0.7,0,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Although it is conceivable that this sex difference only evolves during adolescence or adulthood under influence of sex steroids, this has never been investigated in young adolescents. Aim: First, to assess sex differences in VF performance and regional brain activation in adolescents. Second, to determine if untreated transsexual adolescents differ from their sex of birth with regard to VF performance and regional brain activation. Method: Twenty-five boys, 26 girls, 8 Male-to-Female transsexual adolescents (MtFs), and 14 Female-to-Male transsexual adolescents (FtMs) were tested in a cross-sectional study, while performing a phonetic and semantic VF task within an MRI scanner. Main Outcome Measures: Functional MRI response during VF task. Results: Boys and girls produced similar amounts of words, but the group MtFs produced significantly more words in the phonetic condition compared to control boys, girls, and FtMs. During the semantic condition, no differences were found. With regard to brain activity, control boys showed more activation in the right Rolandic operculum, a small area adjacent to Broca's area, compared to girls. No significant differences in brain activity were found comparing transsexual adolescents, although sub-threshold activation was found in the right Rolandic operculum indicating a trendwise increase in activation from control girls to FtMs to MtFs to control boys. Conclusions: The better performance of MtFs is consistent with our expectation that MtFs perform better on female-favoring tasks. Moreover, they produced more words than girls and FtMs. Even though a trendwise linear increase in brain activity between the four groups only approached significance, it may indicate differences in individuals with gender identity disorder compared to their birth sex. Although our findings should thus be interpreted with caution, they suggest a biological basis for both transgender groups performing in-between the two sexes. © 2013 International Society for Sexual Medicine.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,14.5,17,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

To this aim, a paradigm based on word-pair visual presentation was used in which the same words were processed in Semantic and Phonological tasks. Theta band amplitude, a cortical index that has been related to working memory processing, was analysed during four different phases of word elaboration, thus allowing to measure also the temporal dynamics of word reading/encoding in the verbal working memory. Control subjects showed a specific (and therefore efficient) task-related and time-dependent cortical activation: a peak of theta activity during word reading was found that decayed during the next inter stimulus interval. Furthermore, during word presentation in the Phonological task, theta amplitude was greater on the left hemisphere. Dyslexics evidenced an altered pattern of theta activation both in the temporal dimension and in the cortical space: their peak of activity was delayed to the first inter stimulus interval after word offset and was shifted to the right hemisphere throughout the whole epoch of Phonological task and in two phases of the Semantic task. Analysis of alpha band failed to replicate the complex pattern of lateralization found for theta band in the two groups, a result that suggests a specific functional role of theta band, which cannot be interpreted as a simple marker of cortical inhibition. Results point to a deficit, in dyslexic children, to recruit left hemisphere structures for the elaboration of the phonological component of the verbal working memory. This deficit was marked by a different, unspecific and dysfunctional hemispherical asymmetry of theta activation to language, a deficit that involved also the time course of phonological linguistic elaboration. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Six factors were then compared between those 2 groups: prematurity, perinatal adversity, presence of more than 1 comorbidity, CP subtype, bimanual dexterity (Manual Ability Classification System [MACS]), and gross motor function (Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS]).ResultsParticipants with no perinatal adversity were 5.518 times more likely to have a normal MRI (p < 0.0001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.153-7.330). Furthermore, participants with dyskinetic, ataxic/hypotonic, and spastic diplegic forms of CP were 2.045 times more likely to have a normal MRI than those with hemiplegia, triplegia, and quadriplegia (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 1.506-2.778). No significant difference was found in prematurity, GMFCS levels, MACS levels, and the number of comorbidities.ConclusionsNormal MRIs were associated with lack of perinatal adversity as well as with the dyskinetic, ataxic/hypotonic, and spastic diplegic CP subtypes. As MRI normality is not strongly associated with the severity of CP, continuous follow-up in children with normal imaging appears warranted. Further advanced imaging modalities, as well as strong consideration for metabolic and genetic testing, may provide additional insights into causal pathways in this population. © American Academy of Neurology.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,1.73,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We sought to understand the dyadic effect of exclusion by kin (as opposed to non-kin strangers) on brain activity of the mother and her child and their subjective distress. To this end, we probed mother-child relationships with a computerized ball-toss game Cyberball. When excluded by one another, rather than by a stranger, both mothers and children exhibited a significantly pronounced frontal P2. Moreover, upon kin rejection versus stranger rejection, both mothers and children showed incremented left frontal positive slow waves for rejection events. Children reported more distress upon exclusion than their own mothers. Similar to past work, relatively augmented negative frontal slow wave activity predicted greater self-reported ostracism distress. This effect, generalized to the P2, was limited to mother- or child-rejection by kin, with comparable magnitude of effect across kin identity (mothers vs. children). For both mothers and children, the frontal P2 peak was significantly pronounced for kin rejection versus stranger rejection. Taken together, our results document the rapid categorization of social signals as kin relevant and the specificity of early and late neural markers for predicting felt ostracism. Kin rejection was examined by looking at neural responses in children and their mothers while playing the computer game Cyberball. Responses, specifically the frontal P2 and slow wave, were selectively greater for rejection by kin than by stranger. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,11.05,12,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

This study sought to identify rates and risk factors for recurrent AIS or transient ischemic attack in a cohort of children seen after index AIS and uniformly investigated and managed using contemporary clinical guidelines. Methods-Case note and radiology review of children >28 days and <18 years of age who presented to Great Ormond Street Hospital from 2005 to 2015 with index AIS. Demographic characteristics, medical history, index AIS features, radiological findings, and neurological outcome were examined. Recurrence was identified from clinical records and coded as AIS (if there was associated new cerebral infarction) or transient ischemic attack. Results-Eighty-four children (43 girls; median age at index AIS, 4.1 years) were identified. Cumulative AIS recurrence was 5% at 1 month, 10% at 3 months, 12% at 6 months, 12% at 12 months, and 15% at 60 months after index event. Factors that independently predicted AIS recurrence were referral to Great Ormond Street Hospital from outside the catchment area, a prior relevant diagnosis, bilateral arteriopathy, and AIS CASCADE category 3A or 3B (Childhood AIS Standardized Classification and Diagnostic Evaluation). Multiple infarcts and evidence of mature, as well as acute, infarcts on first brain imaging, although independently associated with AIS recurrence, were also associated with bilateral arteriopathy. Only CASCADE categories 3A and 3B (bilateral cerebral arteriopathy with or without collaterals) remained significant in multivariate analysis. AIS recurrence was not associated with poor neurological outcome. Conclusions-AIS recurrence remains a significant problem, despite the wide use of antithrombotic medications. AIS subtypes should direct clinicians and future trials to use stratified management strategies and durations of treatment. Bilateral cerebral arteriopathies are especially sinister, and consensus criteria should be developed to improve consistency of management. © 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,4.1,18,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Therefore, gray and white matter density values were extracted from brain areas previously reported to be relevant for number processing in developing brain systems and, thereafter, correlated with response time results tapping semantic number knowledge [i.e. numerical distance effect (NDE) derived from a number comparison task] as well as with general math proficiency (as indexed by a standardized calculation test). Behavioral results disclosed a significant NDE, thus indicating well-established number magnitude representations for one-digit numerals in our study group. Significant positive correlations between gray matter and NDE emerged in parietal regions (including the right anterior inferior and the left superior parietal lobe) and in the right superior temporal gyrus. Moreover, white matter and NDE were negatively correlated in the right anterior inferior parietal lobe and the right inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, our results are novel insofar as they show that in 6-7-year-old children born prematurely, individual differences in gray and white matter structures are associated with numerical skills. Importantly, in our study group the observed link between brain structure and behavioral performance emerges only regarding an experimental task tapping semantic number knowledge, whereas general math proficiency does not seem to be related to individual differences in brain structure in our study group. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,7.2,7,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

It is apparent from the extant literature that this disorder is poorly understood from a neurobiological perspective. There are nonetheless a number of clinical and preclinical observations which, at times, converge to illuminate areas worthy of further study. Included in this category are suggestive findings of central serotonergic dysregulation in SP, response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors in SP, and the role of serotonergic function in septohippocampal models of anxiety. Abnormalities in central dopaminergic function are also posited, supported to some extent by recent neuroimaging findings. There are also a number of animal and human behavioral models in existence that may be relevant to the study of SP. Included in this category are models of social dominance in wild baboons, social affiliation in the prairie vole, and behavioral inhibition to the unfamiliar in childhood. Newer technologies that are likely to play a major role in the delineation of the neural circuitry and heritability of SP are discussed. Finally, an interactive role for biology and experience in the expression of SP is considered.

At a single word level, neuroimaging studies indicate that auditory perception involves both hemispheres, whereas phoneme processing and word processing engage predominantly the left hemisphere. The role of the right hemisphere in the processing of words with specific characteristics is controversial. Syntactic processing predominantly shows brain activity in the left hemisphere, although there is some indication that different aspects of syntax activate different parts of a network in both hemispheres. Both hemispheres seem to be implicated in the integration of lexical semantic information. Neuroimaging studies implicate the left hemisphere in deductive and syllogistic reasoning processes and in processes that are necessary to establish local coherence. Individual characteristics such as gender, handedness, age, language proficiency, or specific brain damage can also influence language lateralization. It seems that in children or young adolescents the degree of lateralization increases with age and language proficiency. There is no particular evidence from imaging studies that supports a specific role for the right hemisphere in bi- or multilingual people. Concerning pathological populations, neuroimaging studies indicate that epilepsy patients show a higher variability of language dominance, and schizophrenic patients show increased activation in the right hemisphere during low-level language tasks. Predominant activation of structures in the affected hemisphere of aphasic patients has been related to good recovery. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Symptom dimensions are increasingly used as quantitative traits in genetic, neuroimaging, and treatment studies of OCD across all ages. Identification of a category-based OCD symptom dimension structure that is validated for use across child, adolescent, and adult age groups is necessary to guide ongoing translational research. Method: Four OCD samples comprising 356 individuals were divided into child, adolescent, and adult groups. The fit of the only CFA-defined four-factor model was compared across these independent age group samples. Multiple-group CFA using maximum likelihood estimation assessed adequacy of fit comparing unconstrained and measurement weight-constrained models. The fit of previous exploratory factor analysis-defined three- and five-factor models on adults was also examined using CFA. Results: A four-factor solution provided adequate but imperfect fit across age groups, with comparable indices to the only previous OCD CFA: factor 1 (aggressive/sexual/religious/somatic/checking); factor 2 (symmetry/ordering/ counting/ repeating); factor 3 (contamination/cleaning), and factor 4 (hoarding). Models in which factor loadings were constrained and unconstrained across the three age groups yielded comparable model fit. Factors were highly correlated and were not mutually exclusive. The four-factor solution provided an improved fit to both three- and five-factor solutions using CFA across the three age groups. Conclusions: A four-factor, CFA-defined, category-based model of OCD symptom dimensions is adequate for use in children, adolescents, and adult age groups. The factor structure of this multiple age group sample has limitations and is imperfect, but current findings support the comparability of the defined latent OCD dimensions across age groups.

Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the responsible ethics commission, and patients gave written informed consent. Eighty-one patients (36 female and 45 male patients; age range, 7-75 years) with different brain tumors underwent blood oxygen level-dependent functional MR imaging at 1.5 T with two paradigms: sentence generation (SG) and word generation (WG). Functional MR imaging measurements, data processing, and evaluation were fully standardized by using dedicated software. Four regions of interest were evaluated in each patient: the Broca and Wernicke areas and their anatomic homologues in the right hemisphere. Statistics were calculated. Results: The SG and WG paradigms were successfully completed by all (100%) and 70 (86%) patients, respectively. Success rates in localizing and lateralizing language were 96% for the Broca and Wernicke areas with the SG paradigm, 81% for the Broca area and 80% for the Wernicke area with the WG paradigm, and 98% for both areas when the SG and WG paradigms were used in combination. Functional localizations were consistent for SG and WG paradigms in the inferior frontal gyrus (Broca area) and the superior temporal, supramarginal, and angular gyri (Wernicke area).

Yet, the DSM diagnostic requirements for children and adolescents for PTSD may fail to capture traumatized youth with significant distress and functional impairment. Many important studies have utilized PTSD diagnosis as a mechanism for grouping individuals for comparative studies examining brain functioning, neuroendocrinology, genetics, attachment, and cognition; however, focusing only on those with the diagnosis of PTSD can miss the spectrum of symptoms and difficulties that impact children who experience trauma and subsequent impairment. Some studying child trauma have focused on examining brain and biology of those with exposure and potential impairment rather than only those with PTSD. This line of inquiry, complementary to PTSD specific studies, has aided our understanding of some of the changes in brain structure and neuroregulatory systems at different developmental periods following traumatic exposure. Application of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework proposed by NIMH to the study of child trauma exposure and subsequent impairment is an opportunity to examine domains of function and how they are impacted by trauma. Research to date has focused largely in the areas of negative valence, regulatory, and cognitive systems, however those studying complex or developmental trauma have identified an array of domains that are impacted which map onto many of the RDoC categories. This paper will review the relevant literature associated with child trauma as it relates to the RDoC domains, outline areas of needed research, and describe their implications for treatment and the advancement of the field. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the pathological records of 8181 cytological specimens of CSF, which were diagnosed over a 17-year period. Between 2000 and 2014, a total of 6994 CSF samples were processed using cytospin method and 1187 specimens were examined using ThinPrep method in the period between 2015 and 2017. Results: The most frequent metastatic neoplasm of the first period was non-Hodgkin lymphoma; in the second period the commonest malignancy found was brain tumour (glioblastoma and medulloblastoma). The samples processed by cytospin revealed cytolysis and haemorrhage, while the cases processed by ThinPrep had a clear background. Ten false-positive cases belonging to the suspicious category were processed by cytospin, while there was only one false positive case in the group processed by ThinPrep. The positive predictive value was 95% in cytospin and 100% in Thin Prep with comparable sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy and negative predictive values.

Our goal was to determine how a mother's brain responds to her own infant's facial expressions, comparing happy, neutral, and sad face affect. METHODS. In an event-related functional MRI study, 28 first-time mothers were shown novel face images of their own 5- to 10-month-old infant and a matched unknown infant. Sixty unique stimuli from 6 categories (own-happy, own-neutral, own-sad, unknown-happy, unknown-neutral, and unknown-sad) were presented randomly for 2 seconds each, with a variable 2- to 6-second interstimulus interval. RESULTS. Key dopamine-associated reward-processing regions of the brain were activated when mothers viewed their own infant's face compared with an unknown infant's face. These included the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra regions, the striatum, and frontal lobe regions involved in (1) emotion processing (medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and insula cortex), (2) cognition (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and (3) motor/behavioral outputs (primary motor area). Happy, but not neutral or sad own-infant faces, activated nigrostriatal brain regions interconnected by dopaminergic neurons, including the substantia nigra and dorsal putamen. A region-of- interest analysis revealed that activation in these regions was related to positive infant affect (happy > neutral > sad) for each own-unknown infant-face contrast. CONCLUSIONS. When first-time mothers see their own infant's face, an extensive brain network seems to be activated, wherein affective and cognitive information may be integrated and directed toward motor/behavioral outputs. Dopaminergic reward- related brain regions are activated specifically in response to happy, but not sad, infant faces. Understanding how a mother responds uniquely to her own infant, when smiling or crying, may be the first step in understanding the neural basis of mother-infant attachment.

However, little is known about neural substrates of children in the phonological domain, or about sex differences. Here, we conducted a large‐scale study (n = 484) of school‐aged children using functional near‐infrared spectroscopy and a word repetition task, which requires a great extent of phonological processing. We investigated cortical activation during word processing, emphasizing sex differences, to clarify similarities and differences between L1 and L2, and proficiency‐related differences during early L2 learning. L1 and L2 shared similar neural substrates with decreased activation in L2 compared to L1 in the posterior superior/middle temporal and angular/supramarginal gyri for both sexes. Significant sex differences were found in cortical activation within language areas during high‐frequency word but not during low‐frequency word processing. During high‐frequency word processing, widely distributed areas including the angular/supramarginal gyri were activated in boys, while more restricted areas, excluding the angular/supramarginal gyri were activated in girls. Significant sex differences were also found in L2 proficiency‐related activation: activation significantly increased with proficiency in boys, whereas no proficiency‐related differences were found in girls. Importantly, cortical sex differences emerged with proficiency. Based on previous research, the present results indicate that sex differences are acquired or enlarged during language development through different cognitive strategies between sexes, possibly reflecting their different memory functions.

Specifically, the study is focused on the brain-behavior associations within the RDoC construct of frustrative non-reward. On the behavioral level, this construct is defined by reactions elicited in response to withdrawal or prevention of reward, most notably reactive aggression. This study is designed to test the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and electrophysiological (EEG) correlates of aggression and its reduction after CBT. Methods: Eighty children and adolescents with high levels of aggression across multiple traditional diagnostic categories, ages 8-16, will be randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions of CBT or 12 sessions of supportive psychotherapy. Clinical outcomes will be measured by the ratings of aggressive behavior collected at baseline, midpoint, and endpoint evaluations, and by the Improvement Score of the Clinical Global Impressions Scale assigned by an independent evaluator (blinded rater). Subjects will also perform a frustration-induction Go-NoGo task and a task of emotional face perception during fMRI scanning and EEG recording at baseline and endpoint. Results: Consistent with the NIMH strategic research priorities, if functional neuroimaging and EEG variables can identify subjects who respond to CBT for aggression, this can provide a neuroscience-based classification scheme that will improve treatment outcomes for children and adolescents with aggressive behavior. Conclusions: Demonstrating that a change in the key nodes of the emotion regulation circuitry is associated with a reduction of reactive aggression will provide evidence to support the validity of the frustrative non-reward construct. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In behavioral performance, there was a significant classical Stroop interference effect as indexed by longer response time and higher error rate for the color task than the neutral task, whereas there was no evident interference effect for the color homophones. The NIRS data agreed with the behavioral data, and showed a significant Stroop effect only for the color characters in the bilateral PFC. These results suggested that phonology may not play an important role in semantic activation of Chinese characters for children. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,9.9,11,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Long-term neurocognitive sequelae and quality of life have not yet been fully investigated. Aim To examine neurocognitive outcome and quality of life in pediatric monophasic acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Methods Of the 36 patients diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis at our institution, six were lost to follow-up and eight relapsed (two with multiphasic forms and six with multiple sclerosis). The outcome of the 22 remaining patients was evaluated using four subscales of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for estimation of IQ, a battery of neuropsychological tests, and semistructured and PedsQL questionnaires for quality of life. The effect of age at onset, neuroradiological recovery, and time elapsed from the acute event on outcome was also investigated. Results Estimated IQ, neuropsychological mean group scores, and quality of life at follow-up were within the normal range, but 23% of the patients had pathological scores in various neuropsychological functions, among which attention was the most clearly affected. The neuroradiological recovery was not correlated with the result of the neuropsychological tests. Age at onset correlated with linguistic skills, whereas the time elapsed from the acute event had a significant effect on attention tasks: scores were worse in the group of patients with a follow-up shorter than 7 years. Conclusion Our results suggest that pediatric monophasic acute disseminated encephalomyelitis has a favorable neurocognitive outcome. Patients with longer follow-up had a better outcome, suggesting a neurocognitive course that is different from that of multiple sclerosis and a potential for long-term recovery of affected functions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-six underwent chronic intracranial ictal recordings (CIR) with video monitoring; 20 of these went on to surgical resection. Eleven underwent surgery without CIR. Retrospectively, we determined that 19 had pure FLE, 12 had frontal plus extrafrontal epileptogenic zones, and six others did not have FLE. We analysed the whole group and individual categories to evaluate the determinants of surgical outcome. Sixty percent of the pure frontal group is seizure free with all having ≤75% reduction. The frontal-plus group had only 10% seizure free with 70% having ≤75% reduction. Being in the pure frontal group was associated with better outcomes than the 'frontal-plus' group (P&lt;0.05; χ-square). Subjects with FSIQ ≤85, focal pathologies and 18FDG-PET scans which were normal or had focal abnormalities (P ≤ 0.05, all, χ-square) were more likely to have excellent outcomes. MRI abnormalities, surface EEG, and location and size of resection were not predictive of surgical outcomes. Rasmussen's encephalitis, incomplete surgical strategies and bilateral loci were apparent in those with poor outcomes, and surgical size predicted post-operative deficits (χ-square; P &lt; 0.001). We conclude that careful, hypothesis-driven implants and operating procedures can result in good surgical outcomes for frontal lobe epilepsy subjects even when lesions are not apparent on routine neuroimaging.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,47,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Although it does not mean that in children with epilepsy there are not diagnosed any different motor disorders. Aim of the study was to determined the differences between epilepsy with and without gross motor function disorders, the appearance of clumsiness in children with partial epilepsy and primary generalised. MATERIAL: The study was performed on a group of 40 children with idiopathic epilepsy, 23 with idiopathic partial seizures and 17 with generalised. In this group boys predominated (14/23 and 11/17). The average age of both groups was not significant different (12.5 and 13.4). The assessment of gross motor function and intellectual development was normal. METHODS: The assessment of clumsiness was performed by using 10 tests classifying 3 categories of movement: co-ordination, integration, balance. To diagnose the type of epilepsy the common used clinical, electrophisiological and neuroimaging procedures were done. The statistic assessment was performed by using T-test for independent probe. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups of children in 2 test evaluating balance, which were normal. Children with generalised epilepsy had normal results in other 5 test. The lower results were observed in children with partial epilepsy in 8 and with generalised in 3 tests, but this difference was not statistically significant (VAR2/VAR1 = 0.793 and AR3/VAR1 = 0.965). Results of children with partial seizures were lower in 8 tests, but it was not statistically significant(VAR3/ VAR2 = 0.827). The most expressive difference was seen in the test of balance with jumping.

The impact of the latest generation CT technology, including whole organ perfusion, on indications and utilization patterns during the study period was also assessed. The top five requested CT scan types were abdomen/pelvis, chest, head, sinuses, and coronary CT angiography. Indication and utilization rates were similar to prior studies for abdomen/pelvis, non-cardiac chest, and head CT scans. Abdominal pain and headaches were the most frequent indications for abdomen/pelvis and head CTs, respectively. The 7.3% cardiac CT scan utilization rate was not comparable to rates of up to 72% in self-referral outpatient settings. Whole organ volume CT imaging was utilized in 100% of coronary CT angiography and 22.7% of head CTs. The 320-row CT had fewer negative head and body CT findings as compared to prior reports. The availability of new technology, such as whole organ dynamic scans, appears to have influenced CT indications, utilization and finding rates with a decrease in negative brain and body results. Comparisons with previous outpatient CT studies were similar for multiple categories with the exception of cardiac CT utilization, which is heavily influenced by self-referral. Further study of outpatient imaging indications and utilization rates from multiple centers may benefit from a standardized categorization to improve understanding of the disparate outpatient imaging environment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,54.1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Materials and Methods: An institutional review board approved this retrospective study; informed consent was waived. Pre- and postoperative perfusion MR imaging data in 67 children with moyamoya disease (mean age, 7.2 years; range, 2-13 years) were included. Regional time to peak (rTTP) and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were calculated by adjusting cerebral time to peak (TTP) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) values by using cerebellar reference values. For quantitative regional analysis, pixel values were divided into five categories (>0, >2, >4, >6, and >8 seconds), and percentages of pixels in rTTP meeting these time conditions were calculated. Changes in the values after revascularization were calculated. Postoperative clinical outcomes were categorized as follows: 1 indicated excellent; 2, good; 3, fair; and 4, poor. Pre- and postoperative perfusion parameters were compared by using a paired t test; relationships between perfusion parameters and clinical outcomes were investigated by using one-way analysis of variance, with a significance level of .05. Results: rTTP, rCBV, and percentage of pixels of rTTP decreased significantly after revascularization surgery. Pre- and postoperative rTTP were significantly different for the clinical outcome categories. Change in rTTP and change in percentage of pixels of rTTP (>0 seconds to >6 seconds) were significantly different for the clinical outcome categories. Conclusion: TTP and CBV perfusion maps can depict hemodynamic status after revascularization surgery in moyamoya disease. Furthermore, changes in TTP perfusion maps after revascularization surgery correspond with clinical outcome in patients with moyamoya disease. © RSNA, 2009.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,7.2,13,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Behavioral studies have shown that this lexical integration process is enhanced when there is more time for consolidation. Neuroimaging studies have further revealed that novel word representations are initially represented in a hippocampally-centered system, whereas left posterior middle temporal cortex activation increases with lexicalization. In this study, we measured behavioral and brain responses to newly-learned words in children. Two groups of Dutch children, aged between 8–10 and 14–16 years, were trained on 30 novel Japanese words depicting novel concepts. Children were tested on word-forms, word-meanings, and the novel words’ influence on existing word processing immediately after training, and again after a week. In line with the adult findings, hippocampal involvement decreased with time. Lexical integration, however, was not observed immediately or after a week, neither behaviorally nor neurally. It appears that time alone is not always sufficient for lexical integration to occur.

However, the use of speech and other broadly defined categories of behaviorally relevant natural sounds has led to many discrepancies regarding where voice-sensitivity occurs, and more generally the identification of cortical networks, ""proto-networks"" or protolanguage networks, and pathways that may be sensitive or selective for certain aspects of vocalization processing. In this prospective review we examine different approaches for exploring vocal communication processing, including pathways that may be, or become, specialized for conspecific utterances. In particular, we address the use of naturally produced non-stereotypical vocalizations (mimicry of other animal calls) as another category of vocalization for use with human and non-human primate auditory systems. We focus this review on two main themes, including progress and future ideas for studying vocalization processing in great apes (chimpanzees) and in very early stages of human development, including infants and fetuses. Advancing our understanding of the fundamental principles that govern the evolution and early development of cortical pathways for processing non-verbal communication utterances is expected to lead to better diagnoses and early intervention strategies in children with communication disorders, improve rehabilitation of communication disorders resulting from brain injury, and develop new strategies for intelligent hearing aid and implant design that can better enhance speech signals in noisy environments.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled ""Communication Sounds and the Brain: New Directions and Perspectives"". © 2013.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

This limits their utility as epilepsy biomarkers for surgery. We assessed the spatiotemporal propagation of interictal ripples on intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in children with MRE, compared it with the propagation of spikes, identified ripples that initiated propagation (onset-ripples), and evaluated their clinical value as epilepsy biomarkers. Methods: Twenty-seven children who underwent epilepsy surgery were studied. We identified propagation sequences of ripples and spikes across multiple iEEG contacts and calculated each ripple or spike latency from the propagation onset. We classified ripples and spikes into categories (ie, onset, spread, and isolated) based on their spatiotemporal characteristics and correlated their mean rate inside and outside resection with outcome (good outcome, Engel 1 versus poor outcome, Engel≥2). We determined, as onset-zone, spread-zone, and isolated-zone, the areas generating the corresponding ripple or spike category and evaluated the predictive value of their resection. Results: We observed ripple propagation in all patients and spike propagation in 25 patients. Mean rate of onset-ripples inside resection predicted the outcome (odds ratio = 5.37; p = 0.02) and correlated with Engel class (rho = −0.55; p = 0.003). Resection of the onset-ripple-zone was associated with good outcome (p = 0.047). No association was found for the spread-ripple-zone, isolated-ripple-zone, or any spike-zone. Interpretation: Interictal ripples propagate across iEEG contacts in children with MRE. The association between the onset-ripple-zone resection and good outcome indicates that onset-ripples are promising epilepsy biomarkers, which estimate the epileptogenic tissue better than spread-ripples or onset-spikes.

Occipital resections for epilepsy are rare. Reasons for this are the relative infrequency of occipital epilepsy, difficulty in localizing epilepsy originating in the occipital lobe, imprecisely defined seizure outcome in patients treated with focal occipital resections in the MR imaging era, and concerns about producing visual deficits. The impact of lesion location on vision and seizure biology, the management decision-making process, and the outcomes following resection need elaboration. Methods. The authors studied 21 consecutive patients who underwent focal occipital resections for epilepsy at Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center over a 13-year period during which MR imaging was used. Demographics, imaging, and data relating to the epilepsy and its surgical management were collected. The collateral sulcus, the border between the medial surface and the lateral convexity, and the inferior temporal sulcus were used to subdivide the occipital lobe into medial, lateral, and basal zones. Lesions that did not involve most or all of the occipital lobe (sublobar) were spatially categorized into these zones. Visual function, semiology, and scalp electroencephalography were evaluated in relation to these spatial categories. Preresection and postresection visual function and seizure frequency were evaluated and compared. Lastly, an exhaustive review and discussion of the published literature on occipital resections for epilepsy was carried out. Results. Five lesions were lobar and 16 were sublobar. Patients with medial or lobar lesions had a much greater likelihood of preoperative visual field defects. Those with basal or lateral lesions had a greater likelihood of having a visual aura preceding some or all of their seizures and a trend (not significant) toward having a concordant lateralized onset by scalp electroencephalography. Invasive recordings were used in 8 cases. All patients had lesions (malformations of cortical development, tumors, or gliosis) that were completely resected, as evaluated on postoperative MR imaging. At last follow-up, 17 patients (81%) were seizure free or had only occasional auras (Wieser Class 1 or 2). The remaining 4 patients (19%) had a worthwhile improvement in seizure control (Class 3 or 4). Of the patients for whom both pre- and postoperative visual testing data were available, 50% suffered no new visual deficits, and 17% each developed a new quadrantanopia or a hemianopia. Conclusions. Lesional occipital lobe epilepsy can be successfully managed with resection to obtain excellent seizure-free rates. Individually tailored resections (in lateral occipital lesions, for example) may help preserve intact vision in a subset of cases (38% in this series). Invasive recordings may further guide surgical decision-making as delineated by an algorithm generated by the authors. The authors' results suggest that the spatial location of the lesion correlates both with the semiology of the seizure and with the presence of visual deficit.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,28,42,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Electrical stimulations localised the motor area in all patients when performed (49% of patients), even in group 1 (62% of patients). SEEG led to surgery in 78% of patients (90.5% in group 1; 73% in group 2), after a second invasive investigation in 9.2 % of patients. The resection involved more than one lobe in 25% of patients (37% in group 1; 19% in group 2). Ultimately, 78% of patients with a low probability of having surgery before SEEG received surgery (88% in group 1). The surgical outcome of Engel class 1 was reported for 67% of patients (79% of patients in group 1 and 59% in group 2). No complications occurred. Conclusion: SEEG in children is safe and useful, and the surgical outcome in younger children is as good as, or sometimes even better than, that in older children. As a result of lower rates of complication and morbidity, SEEG appears to be more appropriate, in comparison to subdural grids, in situations where it is unclear if patients will have surgery after an invasive investigation.

Familiar faces, however, include one's own face, partner's and parents' faces. Using event-related fMRI, we examined the neural correlates of these personally familiar faces. Ten participants were presented with photographs of own, partner, parents, famous and unfamiliar faces and responded to a distinct target. Whole brain, two regions of interest (fusiform gyrus and cingulate gyrus), and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Compared with baseline, all familiar faces activated the fusiform gyrus; own faces also activated occipital regions and the precuneus; partner faces activated similar areas, but in addition, the parahippocampal gyrus, middle superior temporal gyri and middle frontal gyrus. Compared with unfamiliar faces, only personally familiar faces activated the cingulate gyrus and the extent of activation varied with face category. Partner faces also activated the insula, amygdala and thalamus. Regions of interest analyses and laterality indices showed anatomical distinctions of processing the personally familiar faces within the fusiform and cingulate gyri. Famous faces were right lateralized whereas personally familiar faces, particularly partner and own faces, elicited bilateral activations. Regression analyses show experiential predictors modulated with neural activity related to own and partner faces. Thus, personally familiar faces activated the core visual areas and extended frontal regions, related to semantic and person knowledge and the extent and areas of activation varied with face type.

Whether these deficits are associated with increased sensitivity to external salient stimuli remains unclear. To address this issue, we acquired functional brain images (fMRI) in 38 boys with and without ADHD (age: 11-16 years). To differentiate the effects of item novelty, contextual rareness and task relevance, participants performed a visual oddball task including four stimulus categories: a frequent standard picture (62.5%), unique novel pictures (12.5%), one repeated rare picture (12.5%), and a target picture (12.5%) that required a specific motor response. As a main finding, we can show considerable overlap in novelty-related BOLD responses between both groups, but only healthy participants showed neural deactivation in temporal as well as frontal regions in response to novel pictures. Furthermore, only ADHD patients, but not healthy controls, engaged wide parts of the novelty network when processing the rare but familiar picture. Our results provide first evidence that ADHD patients show enhanced neural activity in response to novel but behaviorally irrelevant stimuli as well as reduced habituation to familiar items. These findings suggest an inefficient use of neuronal resources in children with ADHD that could be closely linked to increased distractibility. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,13.58,16,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

A key feature of (selective) attention is the ability to ignore irrelevant but salient information in the environment (distractors). Although crucial for cognitive performance, until now, it is not known how the use of methylphenidate affects resistance to attentional capture by distractors. Objectives: The present study aims to clarify how methylphenidate affects distractor suppression in healthy individuals. Methods: The effect of methylphenidate (20 mg) on distractor suppression was assessed in healthy subjects (N = 20), in a within-subject double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. We used a visuospatial attention task with target faces flanked by strong (faces) or weak distractors (scrambled faces). Results: Methylphenidate increased accuracy on trials that required gender identification of target face stimuli (methylphenidate 88.9 ± 1.4 [mean ± SEM], placebo 86.0 ± 1.2 %; p = .003), suggesting increased processing of the faces. At the same time, however, methylphenidate increased reaction time when the target face was flanked by a face distractor relative to a scrambled face distractor (methylphenidate 34.9 ± 3.73, placebo 26.7 ± 2.84 ms; p = .027), suggesting enhanced attentional capture by distractors with task-relevant features. Conclusions: We conclude that methylphenidate amplifies salience of task-relevant information at the level of the stimulus category. This leads to enhanced processing of the target (faces) but also increased attentional capture by distractors drawn from the same category as the target.

Until now, it is unclear at what level of processing and for what type of context these difficulties in language comprehension occur. Therefore, in the current fMRI study, we investigated the neural correlates of the integration of contextual information during auditory language comprehension in 24 adults with ASD and 24 matched control participants. Different levels of context processing were manipulated by using spoken sentences that were correct or contained either a semantic or world knowledge anomaly. Our findings demonstrated significant differences between the groups in inferior frontal cortex that were only present for sentences with a world knowledge anomaly. Relative to the ASD group, the control group showed significantly increased activation in left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) for sentences with a world knowledge anomaly compared to correct sentences. This effect possibly indicates reduced integrative capacities of the ASD group. Furthermore, world knowledge anomalies elicited significantly stronger activation in right inferior frontal gyrus (RIFG) in the control group compared to the ASD group. This additional RIFG activation probably reflects revision of the situation model after new, conflicting information. The lack of recruitment of RIFG is possibly related to difficulties with exception handling in the ASD group. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,26.2,39,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The first question I derive from the seven insightful commentaries on my paper concerns the extent to which my experience of inadvertently perpetuating trauma through memoir writing can or should serve as a cautionary tale for others. To engage in psychotherapy means to work with another person. Some writers have editors and some writers regularly share work with peers in writing groups. Indeed it can be argued that most writers generally benefit from occasionally breaking the potentially solipsistic self-enclosure of their creative worlds. By this argument, an attempt to build a bridge between the empirical and psychoanalytic levels is a category error equivalent to explaining, for example, my love for my daughter in terms of the limbic system. Perhaps a future memoirist will publish his mother's functional magnetic resonance imaging scans and genomic analysis. But I doubt that forgiveness will ever come in a pill.

Global developmental delay is a common reason for referral to a paediatrician. We examined the aetiological yield of an extensive diagnostic work-up in young children with developmental delay in a tertiary referral centre. Methods. To assess the diagnostic possibilities, we systematically examined 100 consecutive children with global developmental delay (<5 years of age) who visited the paediatric outpatient department over a period of 18 months. An association between the presence of features at initial contact and aetiology was analysed by the 2-tailed Fisher exact test and chi-square test. Results. Of the 100 children, 65 were <2 years of age (mean age 23.6 months) at presentation. The presence of birth asphyxia, sepsis, seizures, abnormal neurological findings, and dysmorphism were significant predictors of aetiology. Four diagnostic categories-chromosomal disorders including Down syndrome, hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, multiple malformation syndromes and cerebral dysgenesis-were the most common causes of global development delay in 20%, 15%, 14% and 11%, respectively. Moderate delay was seen in 42%, severe in 33% and mild in 25% of the patients. The aetiological yield did not differ with the severity of global developmental delay. Additional investigations such as neuroimaging, cytogenetic analysis, metabolic tests and specific molecular tests contributed to a diagnosis in 73% of the children, while in 23% these were the sole means of arriving at a diagnosis. Neuroimaging for a specific indication was almost twice more likely to yield an aetiology when compared with neuroimaging performed as a screening tool (65% v. 35%; p=0.003). Conclusion. The aetiological yield in this selected cohort with global developmental delay was 73%. A step-wise investigational approach is justified in all children with developmental delay, regardless of the severity of delay or the absence of findings on history and physical examination.

Methods: Ten children with prior perinatal left MCA stroke (age 6-16 years) and ten healthy age matched controls completed an executive language activation task. fMRI scans were acquired on a 3 T scanner using T2* weighted gradient echo, echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence. Random effects analysis and independent component analysis (ICA) were used to compute activation maps. Results: Both analysis methods demonstrated alternative activation of cortical areas in children with perinatal stroke. Following perinatal stroke, typical left dominant productive language areas in the inferior frontal gyrus were displaced to anatomical identical areas in the right hemisphere (p = .001). In addition, stroke patients showed more bilateral activation in superior temporal and anterior cingulate gyri and increased activation in primary visual cortex when compared to healthy controls. There was no relation between lesion size and the degree of right hemisphere activation. ICA showed that the healthy controls had a negative correlation with the time course in the right inferior frontal gyrus in the same region that was activated in stroke subjects. Interpretation: This functional MRI study in children revealed novel patterns of cortical language reorganization following perinatal stroke. The addition of ICA is complementary to Random Effects Analysis, allowing for the exploration of potential subtle differences in pathways in functional MRI data obtained from both healthy and pathological groups.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,11.6,16,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In patients with this disease, electroencephalography (EEG) shows non-specific findings, but recently, a unique EEG pattern, named the extreme delta brush, was detected in 40% of adult patients and was suggested to be specific to this type of encephalitis. Here, we describe a two-year-old boy with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, who presented with speech arrest and disturbances of gait and cognition several weeks after developing febrile convulsions. In the early stages of the disease, EEG showed 14–16 Hz, continuous, fast waves characterized by a high amplitude (200–500 ÂµV), very diffuse spreading, and a sharp morphology, during light sleep only, which was compatible with extreme spindles. As the patient's symptoms worsened, this finding was replaced by rhythmic, diffuse, high-voltage, slow waves. Immediately after immunomodulatory therapies, including intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, his clinical manifestations and EEG abnormalities appeared to improve. We propose that although the extreme spindle is a non-specific finding of this type of encephalitis, early EEG monitoring might be necessary to detect not only the extreme delta brush pattern, but also non-specific findings, including extreme spindles, which would aid early diagnosis and treatment. © 2018 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), the current study further explored the interaction between action and language by investigating whether the linguistic context, in which an action word occurs, modulates motor circuitry activity related to the processing of action words. To this end, we examined whether the presentation of hand action-related verbs as positive or negative imperatives, for example, ""Do grasp"" or ""Don't write,"" modulates neural activity in the hand area of primary motor cortex (M1) or premotor cortex (Pm). Subjects (n = 19) were asked to read silently the imperative phrases, in which both meaningful action verbs and meaningless pseudo-verbs were presented, and to decide whether they made sense (lexical decision task). At the behavioral level, response times in the lexical decision task were significantly longer for negative, compared to positive, imperatives. At the neural level, activity was differentially decreased by action verbs presented as negative imperatives for the premotor and the primary motor cortex of both hemispheres. The data suggest that context (here: positive vs. negative imperatives), in which an action verb is encountered, modulates the neural activity within key areas of the motor system. The finding implies that motor simulation (or motor planning) rather than semantic processing per se may underlie previously observed motor system activation related to action verb processing. Furthermore, the current data suggest that negative imperatives may inhibit motor simulation or motor planning processes. © 2010 IBRO.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,17.4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We review findings from recent event-related brain potential (ERP) studies of face perception and face recognition in DP. The generic face-sensitivity of the N170 component is present in most DPs, suggesting rapid category-selective streaming of facial information. In contrast, DPs show atypical N170 face inversion effects, indicative of impaired structural encoding, specifically for upright faces. In line with neurodevelopmental accounts of DP, these effects are similar to those observed for other developmental disorders, as well as for younger children and older adults. Identity-sensitive ERP components (N250, P600f) triggered during successful face recognition are similar for DPs and control participants, indicating that the same mechanisms are active in both groups. The presence of covert face-recognition effects for the N250 component suggests that visual face memory and semantic memory can become disconnected in some individuals with DP.

Aims: Utilizing imaging findings from a population-based registry (REPACQ), the frequency and proportion of cerebral radiologic abnormalities in children CP over a four year birth cohort was investigated. Methods: Descriptions of CT and MRI studies were extracted from the Registry dataset and classified into 10 distinct categories. Results: Two hundred and thirteen children had imaging available (119 males, 94 females, mean age of 44 months [SD. ± 14 months] at Registry inscription). Eighty seven percent of participants had documented cerebral abnormalities, the most common of which were periventricular white matter injury (PVWMI) (19.2%), diffuse gray matter injury (14.6%), cerebral vascular accident (CVA) (11.7%), and cerebral malformation (11.3%). Also, 18.8% of participants had non-specific radiologic findings and 13.1% of participants had normal imaging results. Severe CP (i.e. GMFCS Level IV-V) and spastic quadriplegic CP were significantly associated with the neuroimaging findings of gray matter injury, while spastic hemiplegic CP was association with CVA, and dyskinetic and spastic diplegic CP were both associated with normal and non-specific neuroimaging findings.

These mechanisms were specifically investigated in a group of five adult-onset pharmaco-sensitive patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, exhibiting severe episodic memory complaints despite normal performance at standardized memory assessment. In a first experiment, the magnitude of autobiographical memory loss was evaluated using retrograde personal memory tasks based on verbal and visual cues. In both conditions, results showed an unusual U-shaped pattern of personal memory impairment, encompassing most of the patients’ life, sparing however, periods of the childhood, early adulthood and past several weeks. This profile was suggestive of a long-term consolidation impairment of personal episodes, adequately consolidated over ‘short-term’ delays but gradually forgotten thereafter. Therefore, in a subsequent experiment, patients were submitted to a protocol specifically devised to investigate short and long-term consolidation of contextually-bound experiences (episodic memory) and context-free information (semantic knowledge and single-items). In the short term (1 h), performance at both contextually-free and contextually-bound memory tasks was intact. After a 6-week delay, however, contextually-bound memory performance was impaired while contextually-free memory performance remained preserved. This effect was independent of task difficulty and the modality of retrieval (recall and recognition). Neuroimaging studies revealed the presence of mild metabolic changes within medial temporal lobe structures. Taken together, these results show the existence of different consolidation systems within declarative memory. They suggest that mild medial temporal lobe dysfunction can impede the building and stabilization of episodic memories but leaves long-term semantic and single-items mnemonic traces intact.

Spatiotemporal neural dynamics of word understanding in 12- to 18-month-old-infants. Cereb Cortex. 8:1832-1839). However, there is minimal knowledge of the structural changes that occur within these and other cortical regions important for language development. To identify regional structural changes taking place during this important period in infant development, we examined age-related changes in tissue signal properties of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) intensity and contrast. T1-weighted surface-based measures were acquired from 12- to 19-month-old infants and analyzed using a general linear model. Significant age effects were observed for GM and WM intensity and contrast within bilateral inferior lateral and anterovental temporal regions, dorsomedial frontal, and superior parietal cortices. Region of interest (ROI) analyses revealed that GM and WM intensity and contrast significantly increased with age within the same left lateral temporal regions shown to generate lexico-semantic activity in infants and adults. These findings suggest that neurophysiological processes supporting linguistic and cognitive behaviors may develop before cellular and structural maturation is complete within associative cortices.

However, lacking clear evidence for how or where language is processed in the developing brain, it is unknown whether these processes are similar in infants and adults. Here, we use magnetoencephalography in combination with high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging to noninvasively estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of word-selective brain activity in 12-to 18-month-old infants. Infants watched pictures of common objects and listened to words that they understood. A subset of these infants also listened to familiar words compared with sensory control sounds. In both experiments, words evoked a characteristic event-related brain response peaking ∼400 ms after word onset, which localized to left frontotemporal cortices. In adults, this activity, termed the N400m, is associated with lexico-semantic encoding. Like adults, we find that the amplitude of the infant N400m is also modulated by semantic priming, being reduced to words preceded by a semantically related picture. These findings suggest that similar left frontotemporal areas are used for encoding lexico-semantic information throughout the life span, from the earliest stages of word learning. Furthermore, this ontogenetic consistency implies that the neurophysiological processes underlying the N400m may be important both for understanding already known words and for learning new words. © 2011 The Authors.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,1.3,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Participants listened to action and neutral (non-action) narratives before and after videogame-based bodily training, and responded to questions on information realized by verbs (denoting abstract and action processes) and circumstances (conveying locative or temporal details, for example). Strategically, we worked with dyslexic children, whose potential comprehension deficits could give room to post-training improvements. Results showed a selective boost in understanding of action information, even when controlling for baseline performance. Also, this effect proved uninfluenced by short-term memory skills, and it was absent when training relied on non-action videogames requiring minimal bodily engagement. Of note, the movements described in the texts did not match those performed by participants, suggesting that well-established effector-and direction-specific language embodiment effects may be accompanied by more coarse-grained sensorimotor resonance, driven by activation of motor and visuospatial sensory systems. In sum, the stimulation of movement-related mechanisms seems to selectively boost the appraisal of actions evoked by naturalistic texts.

We investigated whether cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) is associated with neurologic outcomes and survival in children on ECMO. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of children aged 1 day to 20 years who underwent ECMO with routine cerebral rSO2 monitoring in the pediatric intensive care unit at a single academic center between February 2008 and September 2014. We collected all serial rSO2 values recorded in the electronic medical record during the ECMO course.

These biologically relevant abilities have been  associated with early neural responses on the face sensitive N170 component.  However, whether all facial expressions uniformly modulate the N170, and whether  this effect occurs only when emotion categorization is task-relevant, is still  unclear. To clarify this issue, we recorded high-resolution electrophysiological  signals while 22 observers perceived the six basic expressions plus neutral. We used  a repetition suppression paradigm, with an adaptor followed by a target face  displaying the same identity and expression (trials of interest). We also included  catch trials to which participants had to react, by varying identity  (identity-task), expression (expression-task) or both (dual-task) on the target  face. We extracted single-trial Repetition Suppression (stRS) responses using a  data-driven spatiotemporal approach with a robust hierarchical linear model to  isolate adaptation effects on the trials of interest. Regardless of the task, fear  was the only expression modulating the N170, eliciting the strongest stRS responses.  This observation was corroborated by distinct behavioral performance during the  catch trials for this facial expression. Altogether, our data reinforce the view  that fear elicits distinct neural processes in the brain, enhancing attention and  facilitating the early coding of faces.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,21.5,32,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Some regions of ventral stream cortex show preferential activity for specific stimulus categories, but little is known about how this regional specialization develops. Acquisition of letter-naming skill is of particular interest because letter recognition serves as the gateway to visual processing of words, and fluent letter naming predicts children's reading success. For this reason, we examined the school-age development of visual letter processing using fMRI. In a 2 × 2 design, we compared ventral stream BOLD activity in two groups, children (n = 22, age 6-11) and adults (n = 15, age 20-22), during two tasks: naming of single letters and naming of simple line drawings of objects. We hypothesized that, based on adults' greater experience with letters, the posterior left fusiform gyrus would be activated more in adults for letter naming than it would be in children. We found that bilateral areas of ventral stream cortex during letter naming were activated in both children and adults and that the midposterior areas of the fusiform gyrus in both hemispheres were activated to a greater degree in adults than in children. There were no areas within the ventral stream in either hemisphere that were activated preferentially for letters over line drawings, nor were there any significant differences in the developmental changes observed for letter naming compared to object naming. These findings indicate that visual processing of single letters continues to develop in both hemispheres during grade school. However, we found no evidence for development of areas specialized for single letter processing. Rather, our findings suggest that letter recognition is performed using the same general form recognition systems as are used to process other visually similar stimuli. © 2008 New York Academy of Sciences.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,exclude,NaN,11,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The cerebral processes underlying these learning mechanisms remain unclear in adults and unexplored in children. Here, we investigated the neurophysiological patterns underpinning the learning of functions for novel objects in 10-year-old healthy children. Event-related fields (ERFs) were recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a picture-definition task. Two MEG sessions were administered, separated by a behavioral verbal learning session during which children learned short definitions about the ""magical"" function of 50 unknown non-objects. Additionally, 50 familiar real objects and 50 other unknown non-objects for which no functions were taught were presented at both MEG sessions. Children learned at least 75% of the 50 proposed definitions in less than one hour, illustrating children's powerful ability to rapidly map new functional meanings to novel objects. Pre- and post-learning ERFs differences were analyzed first in sensor then in source space. Results in sensor space disclosed a learning-dependent modulation of ERFs for newly learned non-objects, developing 500-800 msec after stimulus onset. Analyses in the source space windowed over this late temporal component of interest disclosed underlying activity in right parietal, bilateral orbito-frontal and right temporal regions. Altogether, our results suggest that learning-related evolution in late ERF components over those regions may support the challenging task of rapidly creating new semantic representations supporting the processing of the meaning and functions of novel objects in children. © 2013 Urbain et al.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,10.21,12,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Learning-dependent changes in brain activity were observed within hippocampal and parahippocampal regions, followed by sleep-dependent changes in the prefrontal cortex, whereas no equivalent change was observed after a similar period of wakeful rest. Hence, our results show that in school-age children a 90-minute daytime nap after learning is sufficient to trigger the reorganization of memory-related brain activity toward prefrontal areas, where it incorporates into pre-existing semantic knowledge. This functional reorganization process in children is similar to that observed in adults but occurs at a much faster rate, which may contribute to the development of the impressive learning skills that characterize childhood. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,10.1,12,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Methods: We undertook a retrospective analysis of cases referred to a tertiary-hospital-based learning disabilities program. Individuals were coded as having a focal deficit if either neurologic or neuropsychological evaluation demonstrated focal dysfunction. Those with abnormal MRI findings were categorized based on findings. Children with abnormalities from each of these categories were compared in terms of deficits in automaticity, as measured by the tasks of Rapid Automatized Naming, Rapid Alternating Stimulus Naming, or the timed motor performance battery from the Physical and Neurological Examination for Soft Signs. Data were compared in children with and without disorders of automaticity regarding type of brain structure abnormality. Results: Of the 1,587 children evaluated, 127 had a focal deficit. Eighty-seven had a brain MRI (52 on 1.5-tesla machines and 35 on 3.0-tesla machines). Forty of these images were found to be abnormal. These children were compared with a clinic sample of 150 patients with learning disabilities and no focal findings on examination, who also had undergone MRI. Only 5 of the latter group had abnormalities on MRI. Reduced verbal automaticity was associated with cerebellar abnormalities, whereas reduced automaticity on motor or motor and verbal tasks was associated with white matter abnormalities.

A primary challenge to its amelioration is heterogeneity in symptom expression within and across disorders. Parsing this heterogeneity is necessary to attain diagnostic precision, a goal of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria Initiative. We aimed to identify transdiagnostic subtypes of EF that span the normal to impaired spectrum and establish their predictive and neurobiological validity. Methods: Community detection was applied to clinical parent-report measures in 8–14-year-old children with and without ADHD and ASD from two independent cohorts (discovery N = 320; replication N = 692) to identify subgroups with distinct behavioral profiles. Support vector machine (SVM) classification was used to predict subgroup membership of unseen cases. Preliminary neurobiological validation was obtained with existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on a subsample (N = 84) by testing hypotheses about sensitivity of EF subgroups versus DSM categories. Results: We observed three transdiagnostic EF subtypes characterized by behavioral profiles that were defined by relative weakness in: (a) flexibility and emotion regulation; (b) inhibition; and (c) working memory, organization, and planning. The same tripartite structure was also present in the typically developing children. SVM trained on the discovery sample and tested on the replication sample classified subgroup membership with 77.0% accuracy. Split-half SVM classification on the combined sample (N = 1,012) yielded 88.9% accuracy (this SVM is available for public use). As hypothesized, frontal-parietal engagement was better distinguished by EF subtype than DSM diagnosis and the subgroup characterized with inflexibility failed to modulate right IPL activation in response to increased executive demands. Conclusions: The observed transdiagnostic subtypes refine current diagnostic nosology and augment clinical decision-making for personalizing treatment of executive dysfunction in children. © 2019 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,14,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

With DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR, the terminology of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) covers two main categories of infantile disorders: disorders of “strictly” autistic nature and pervasive developmental disorders – not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Under the terminology of multiple complex developmental disorder (MCDD), it is proposed to classify children presenting symptoms approaching the psychotic disharmonies and usually diagnosed as PDD-NOS. Such a category of developmental disorders is now included without nosographic distinction in the autistic spectrum in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders (DSM-V). Case report We are reporting a case report of a 6-year-old boy which shows a PDD-NoS/MCDD complex symptomatology type. This child presents multiple disorders: minor neurological signs (soft signs), neuro-psychomotor disorders, developmental coordination disorder (DCD), communication, thought, and regulation of emotions disorders, attention deficit disorders (ADD); in the presence of a high verbal intellectual potential, which makes it difficult to establish a clear diagnosis. A cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out due to the presence of minor neurological signs (soft signs) and of neurodevelopmental multiple disorders. The MRI revealed a voluminous arachnoid temporo-polar left cyst with a marked mass effect on the left temporal lobe. Discussion A neurosurgical intervention allowed to observe the gradual disappearance of the specific symptomatology (in particular soft signs, neuro-psychomotor functions and autistic symptoms) secondary to the interference of the cyst's pressure with intracranial areas involving neurological and psychopathological abnormalities, underlying at the same time the reversibility of the disorders after decompression as demonstrated in some studies. There are always, with a quantitative and qualitative decrease, an emotional dysregulation, a DCD, an ADD as well as impairments in the executive functions. Conclusion This clinical case underlines the necessity of an evaluation in a transdisciplinary way and to follow the developmental evolution of the child in order to focus adapted therapeutics. Furthermore, with neurodevelopmental disorders not specified, it is important to examine the presence of soft signs with standardized neuro-psychomotor assessment, and then, to propose an MRI investigation.

Methods: A community-ascertained sample of individuals (N = 347, 18–59 years of age) completed a battery of behavioral measures, psychiatric assessment, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a cross-sectional design. Bootstrap-based exploratory factor analysis was applied to 49 phenotypic subscales from 10 measures. Hybrid hierarchical clustering was applied to resultant factor scores to identify nested groups. Adjacent groups were compared via independent samples t tests and chi-square tests of factor scores, syndrome scores, and psychiatric prevalence. Multivariate distance matrix regression examined functional connectome differences between adjacent groups. Results: Reduction yielded six factors, which explained 77.8% and 65.4% of the variance in exploratory and constrained exploratory models, respectively. Hybrid hierarchical clustering of these six factors identified two, four, and eight nested groups (i.e., phenotypic communities). At the highest clustering level, the algorithm differentiated functionally adaptive and maladaptive groups. At the middle clustering level, groups were separated by problem type (maladaptive groups; internalizing vs. externalizing problems) and behavioral type (adaptive groups; sensation-seeking vs. extraverted/emotionally stable). Unique phenotypic profiles were also evident at the lowest clustering level. Group comparisons exhibited significant differences in intrinsic functional connectivity at the highest clustering level in somatomotor, thalamic, basal ganglia, and limbic networks. Conclusions: Data-driven approaches for identifying homogenous subgroups, spanning typical function to dysfunction, not only yielded clinically meaningful groups, but also captured behavioral and neurobiological variation among healthy individuals.

The estimated source of the rolandic spike, of the trough between the spike and the following slow wave, and of the slow wave appeared to have the same position but had a small significant difference in orientation. Despite the heterogeneity of associated clinical syndromes, there were no clear differences between the clinical categories of patients regarding the localization and the orientation of the sources of the rolandic spike, trough and slow wave. The presence of a second source could explain the ascending phase of the rolandic spike in 19 children.

Reading comprehension is dependent on word decoding and language comprehension. We investigated neural activation–within brain regions important for reading–related to components of reading comprehension in young VLBW adolescents in direct comparison to normal birth weight (NBW) term-born peers, with the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesized that the decoding mechanisms will be affected by VLBW, and expect to see increased neural activity for VLBW which may be modulated by task performance and cognitive ability. The study investigated 13 (11 included in fMRI) young adolescents (ages 12 to 14 years) born preterm with VLBW and in 13 NBW controls (ages 12–14 years) for performance on the Block Design and Vocabulary subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; and for semantic, orthographic, and phonological processing during an fMRI paradigm. The VLBW group showed increased phonological activation in left inferior frontal gyrus, decreased orthographic activation in right supramarginal gyrus, and decreased semantic activation in left inferior frontal gyrus. Block Design was related to altered right-hemispheric activation, and VLBW showed lower WISC Block Design scores. Left angular gyrus showed activation increase specific for VLBW with high accuracy on the semantic test. Young VLBW adolescents showed no accuracy and reaction time performance differences on our fMRI language tasks, but they did exhibit altered neural activation during these tasks. This altered activation for VLBW was observed as increased activation during phonological decoding, and as mainly decreased activation during orthographic and semantic processing. Correlations of neural activation with accuracy on the semantic fMRI task and with decreased WISC Block Design performance were specific for the VLBW group.

We describe how the framework of a spatial detection method was extended to improve its performance by including temporal information. This results in a method that provides (i) automated localization of an epileptogenic focus and (ii) detection of focal epileptiform events in an EEG recording. For the detection, only one threshold value needs to be set. Methods: The method comprises five consecutive steps: (1) dipole source analysis in a moving window, (2) automatic selection of focal brain activity, (3) dipole clustering to arrive at the identification of the epileptiform cluster, (4) derivation of a spatio-temporal template of the epileptiform activity, and (5) template matching. Routine EEG recordings from eight paediatric patients with focal epilepsy were labelled independently by two experts. The method was evaluated in terms of (i) ability to identify the epileptic focus, (ii) validity of the derived template, and (iii) detection performance. The clustering performance was evaluated using a leave-one-out cross validation. Detection performance was evaluated using Precision-Recall curves and compared to the performance of two temporal (mimetic and wavelet based) and one spatial (dipole analysis based) detection methods. Results: The method succeeded in identifying the epileptogenic focus in seven of the eight recordings. For these recordings, the mean distance between the epileptic focus estimated by the method and the region indicated by the labelling of the experts was 8 mm. Except for two EEG recordings where the dipole clustering step failed, the derived template corresponded to the epileptiform activity marked by the experts. Over the eight EEGs, the method showed a mean sensitivity and selectivity of 92 and 77%, respectively. Conclusions: The method allows automated localization of the epileptogenic focus and shows good agreement with the region indicated by the labelling of the experts. If the dipole clustering step is successful, the method allows a detection of the focal epileptiform events, and gave a detection performance comparable or better to that of the other methods. Significance: The identification and quantification of epileptiform events is of considerable importance in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Our method allows the automatic identification of the epileptic focus, which is of value in epilepsy surgery. The method can also be used as an offline exploration tool for focal EEG activity, displaying the dipole clusters and corresponding time series. © 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,5.5,10,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In the present study, we have investigated whether differences in N1 lateralization can be observed between Dutch children with and without (a familial risk of) dyslexia around the age of 12 years using a linguistic judgement task. Forty-five participants were included in the ERP analysis, 18 in the low familial risk group without dyslexia, 15 in the high familial risk group without dyslexia, and 12 in the high familial risk group with dyslexia. The results showed that although the N1 peaked slightly earlier in the left hemisphere, the N1 amplitude was right-lateralized in all groups. Moreover, there were no group differences in N1 amplitude or latency, and there was no relationship between reading (related) test scores and N1 characteristics. The results of the present study and our previous findings in adults suggest that print-tuning lateralization is a process that is still developing in adolescence. Because other studies did find N1 lateralization in younger readers with a print versus nonprint contrast, the current results seem to indicate that differences in N1 lateralization also depend on the experimental paradigm. © 2018 The Authors Dyslexia Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,12.1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

"Vargas Álvarez, L.A.; Cruz, L.P.; Thompson, G.G.; de la Peña Olvera, F.",2008,databases,Obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents: An update. Second part,Salud Mental,NaN,"During the last years obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been reported with increased prevalence in pediatric population; this is due to the development of more specific assessment methods. This evolution in the evaluation tools has given rise to the possibility of characterizing OCD presentation in children and adolescents. In childhood, OCD is a chronic and distressing disorder that can lead to severe impairments in social, academic and family functioning. Current diagnosis criteria for pediatric OCD are the same than those used in adults. During all life span, obsessive and compulsive symptoms are necessary to establish the presence of the disorder. There are several different clinical manifestations among age groups, different evolution among children, adolescents and adults; all these represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the clinician. Several classifications incorporate pediatric OCD, especially those related to the familiar presentation form and patterns of comorbidity, mainly with tics disorders. At least 50% of children and adolescents with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome develop obsessive-compulsive symptoms or OCD in adulthood and almost a half of early-onset OCD subjects have a tics history. These findings support the notion that tics disorders are the comorbidity more closely related with early-onset OCD, giving elements to consider this association as a specific pediatric OCD subtype. In this age group population, comorbidity has been reported as high as in adulthood; some diagnoses are especially prevalent during childhood and others during adolescence. On the whole, anxiety disorders are frequent with OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, panic attack, social phobia and anxiety separation disorder. Comorbidity related with affective disorders is high too. The OCD association with major depressive disorder (MDD) in childhood is low but increases in adolescence; MDD reaches similar adult comorbidity rates in adolescence. Higher comorbidity prevalence of MDD has been found more related to the duration of OCD-illness than early-onset. Bipolar disorder (BD) is another frequent comorbid entity with great clinical relevance. When BD is the main diagnosis, comorbidity with OCD shows a prevalence of 16%; when OCD is the main diagnosis, comorbidity with BD shows a prevalence of 44%, showing an unidirectional relation. Some studies have shown even higher comorbidity prevalence of BD when considering bipolar spectra dimension as hypomania and cyclothymic disorder (30% and 50%, respectively) in OCD samples. Adults with OCD and BD comorbidity have more frequent episodic form, a greater number of concurrent mayor depressive episodes and a higher rate of religious or sexual obsessions. Adults with OCD without BD comorbidity show more rituals and compulsions. A recent study in pediatric population with BD and OCD found that BD type II was the must common related diagnosis, when age was considered, subjects with bipolar disorder resulted to have an earlier onset of OCD. Other comorbid diagnoses frequently reported in this early-onset OCD population are externalizing disorders as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Children and adolescents with OCD have high rates of commorbid ADHD; this co-occurrence seems to be bidirectional. There is a consistent preponderance of males in most epidemiological studies. The onset of ADHD preceded the onset of OCD and the onset of OCD was earlier when ADHD was comorbid. Children with OCD plus ADHD compared with peers with OCD without ADHD show higher attentional and social problems, as well as aggressive high scores. ADHD is a risk factor for ODD. A valid and reliable clinical interview is needed to establish differential diagnosis among OCD and other compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts present in disorders like anorexia nervosa, body dysmorphic disorder, hypochondrias, tics disorders and impulse control disorders. All these categories have been considered as part of the obsessive-compulsive disorders spectrum. It is important to establish the difference between obsessions with poor insight common in early-onset OCD and overvalued ideas or delusions. Pervasive disorders as autism and Asperger syndrome frequently show stereotyped behaviors which may be considered as obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The diagnostic evaluation of children and adolescents with OCD includes a careful assessment and review of current and past obsessive-compulsive symptoms and comorbid conditions. This evaluation requires interviewing both child/adolescent and parents and usually requires more than one session. For children who do not regard their symptoms as excessive, information from parents, and if possible from teachers, is essential to identify the range of symptoms, severity and context. Many children and adolescents feel confused and embarrassed with their symptoms. It is important to dedicate time to build a true clinical alliance to elicit the story of their symptoms, as well as the impact on a child's thoughts and feelings. There are several useful instruments to establish OCD diagnosis and severity in children and adolescents. Self-report questionnaires have been used to identify the presence and severity of OCD symptoms. The most used self-rated measures for pediatric OCD are the 44-item Leyton Obsession Inventory-Child version (LOI-CV) and its shorter version, the 20-item LOI-CV Survey Form, and the Maudsley Obsession-Compulsion Inventory (MOCI). Clinician-administered interviews may be a more reliable method to identify obsessive-compulsive disorders in youth. The Childs Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS) is a commonly used Clinician-Rated measure of OCD symptoms derived from the Adult Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. CY-BOCS Spanish version was translated in México and as the original version it must be applied to parents and children/adolescents separately; the clinician establishes then the best clinical information with all the data. The initial CY-BOCS section consists of a symptom checklist covering a comprehensive array of obsessions and compulsions. The severity score is derived from the second section of the measure in which global rating of time spent, interference, distress, resistance and control associated with obsessions and compulsions are generated. Separate scores are obtained for obsessions and compulsions, which, when combined, yield a total severity score of a maximum 40 points. Scores greater than or equal to 16 indicate clinically significant OCD in children and adolescents. The knowledge we now have about pediatric OCD pharmacotherapy is better. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of clorimipramine. This was the first agent approved for use in pediatric populations with OCD. Subsequent multisite randomized, placebo-controlled trials of selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have also demonstrated significant efficacy in pediatric population. Almost all meta-analysis with SSRIs studies in children and adolescents with OCD have proved their efficacy. The most common adverse effects of SSRIs are nausea, insomnia, activation and headache. These effects are transient and most children tolerate them. The availability and effectiveness of SSRI have changed dramatically the OCD treatment, and neurobiological and neuroimaging advances have supported their use. Many children and adolescents with OCD need multiple treatments including cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), pharmacologic treatment, parental, family and teachers training. These interventions need to be applied by experts in order to be effective. CBT is a well-documented and effective intervention for adults with OCD. The potential usefulness of CBT for pediatric OCD has been valued and the results report that combined CBT and pharmacotherapy have proved high and sustained response in children and adolescents with OCD.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

The main neuroimaging features in pediatric patients with leukemia or lymphoma treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy were retrospectively reviewed. To simplify the approach and facilitate differential diagnosis, the neuroimaging features have been classified into three main categories: central nervous system manifestations of primary disease, side effects of therapeutic procedures (radiation therapy, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation), and complications due to immunosuppression, particularly infections. Manifestations of primary disease include cerebrovascular complications (hemorrhage, cerebral infarction) and central nervous system involvement (infiltration of the meninges, parenchyma, bone marrow, orbit, and spine). Effects of radiation therapy include white matter disease, mineralizing microangiopathy, parenchymal brain volume loss, radiation-induced cryptic vascular malformations, and second neoplasms. Effects of chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation include hemorrhage, dural venous thrombosis, white matter disease, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, and anterior lumbosacral radiculopathy.

While increasing evidence from neuroimaging studies has indicated that the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) becomes increasingly specialized for symbolic numerical magnitude representation over developmental time, the extent to which these changes are associated with age-related differences in symbolic numerical magnitude representation or with developmental changes in non-numerical processes, such as response selection, remains to be uncovered. To address these outstanding questions we investigated developmental changes in the cortical representation of symbolic numerical magnitude in 6- to 14-year-old children using a passive functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation design, thereby mitigating the influence of response selection. A single-digit Arabic numeral was repeatedly presented on a computer screen and interspersed with the presentation of novel digits deviating as a function of numerical ratio (smaller/larger number). Results demonstrated a correlation between age and numerical ratio in the left IPS, suggesting an age-related increase in the extent to which numerical symbols are represented in the left IPS. Brain activation of the right IPS was modulated by numerical ratio but did not correlate with age, indicating hemispheric differences in IPS engagement during the development of symbolic numerical representation. © 2014 The Authors.

In particular, several studies have measured hemodynamic responses in the occipital region in infants upon exposure to visual stimuli. In the present study, we used a multi-channel NIRS to measure neuronal activity in a macaque monkey who was trained to watch videos showing various circus animals performing acrobatic activities without fixing the head position of the monkey. Cortical activity from the occipital region was measured first by placing a probe comprising a 3 × 5 array of emitters and detectors (2 × 4 cm) on the area (area 17), and the robustness and stability of the results were confirmed across sessions. Cortical responses were then measured from the dorsofrontal region. The oxygenated hemoglobin signals increased in area 9 and decreased in area 8b in response to viewing the videos. The results suggest that these regions are involved in cognitive processing of visually presented stimuli.

In contrast, little is known about neural responses to social interactions in children. Here, we used fMRI to ask whether the pSTS is ‘tuned’ to social interactions in children at all, and if so, how selectivity might differ from adults. This was investigated in the pSTS, along with several other socially-tuned regions in neighbouring temporal cortex: extrastriate body area, face selective STS, fusiform face area, and mentalizing selective temporo-parietal junction. Both children and adults showed selectivity to social interaction within right pSTS, while only adults showed selectivity on the left. Adults also showed both more focal and greater selectivity than children (6–12 years) bilaterally. Exploratory sub-group analyses showed that younger children (6–8), but not older children (9–12), are less selective than adults on the right, while there was a continuous developmental trend (adults > older > younger) in left pSTS. These results suggest that, over development, the neural response to social interactions is characterized by increasingly more selective, focal, and bilateral pSTS responses, a process that likely continues into adolescence. © 2020 The Authors",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,exclude,8.94,12,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In clinical trials, vigabatrin was generally well-tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to that of other AEDs. The most common treatment-related adverse events were central nervous system effects, including drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and fatigue, with adjunctive vigabatrin in adults with rCPS, and sedation, somnolence, and irritability with vigabatrin monotherapy in infants with IS. Vigabatrin had little effect on cognitive function, mood, or behavior in a battery of neuropsychologic tests for rCPS. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of depression and psychosis, but not other psychiatric adverse events, was greater with vigabatrin than placebo. Intramyelinic edema (IME) was initially identified in rats and dogs and led to a temporary suspension of clinical trials in the United States. IME was subsequently correlated with delays in evoked potential (EP) and increased T2-weighted signals on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical trials of vigabatrin were allowed to resume after IME was not detected by neuropathologic assessments of autopsy and neurosurgical specimens or by serial EP or MRI assessments in older children and adults receiving vigabatrin. Subsequently, MRI abnormalities characterized by increased T2 intensity and restricted diffusion were identified in infants treated with vigabatrin for IS. These abnormalities generally resolved with discontinuation of vigabatrin and, in some cases, during continued therapy.

Hemorrhage is a major category of the clinical symptoms of moyamoya disease (MMD). Intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhages are the most common hemorrhages in MMD, and subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAHs) are notably rare. There have only been a few previous case reports of this imaging manifestation. In the present study, we investigated the clinical and neuroimaging features of MMD patients who presented with SAH and sought to identify the possible causes of hemorrhage. Methods. The right and left cerebral hemispheres of each patient were identified as hemorrhagic or non-hemorrhagic. Each hemisphere was assessed for Suzuki stage, and dilatation and branch extension of the anterior choroidal artery (AChA) and posterior communicating artery (P-CoM) and for the degree of transdural anastomosis and posterior circulation compensation. Next, these data were statistically analyzed for correlations with the SAH events. Results. In 34 of 349 hemorrhagic MMD patients, the first episode of hemorrhage was a SAH, among which, 26 (76.5%) patients were women and there was only one pediatric patient. The Suzuki stage was not statistically correlated with the SAH events. There were also no correlations between SAH and dilatation or abnormal branching of the AChA and P-CoM. In contrast, SAH and transdural anastomosis were correlated. 25 of the 34 hemorrhagic hemispheres (73.5%) were positive for transdural anastomosis, and this number was 15 (44.1%) in the non-hemorrhagic hemispheres; this difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusions. SAH is an important type of hemorrhage in MMD patients and ranks as the fourth most common type after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and ICH + IVH. It mainly occurs in adult women, and the rupture of the transdural anastomosis might be the main cause of this condition. © 2015 The Neurosurgical Foundation.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Here, we examined the neural circuitry underlying the interpretation of communicative intent in children and adults using irony comprehension as a test case. Participants viewed cartoon drawings while listening to short scenarios ending with a potentially ironic remark and were asked to decide whether the speaker was being sincere or ironic. In both children and adults, instructions to attend to the cues provided by the speaker's facial expression or tone of voice modulated the activity in visual and language cortices, respectively. Overall, children engaged the medial prefrontal cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus more strongly than adults, whereas adults recruited the fusiform gyrus, extrastriate areas and the amygdala more strongly than children. Greater involvement of prefrontal regions in children may subserve the integration of multiple cues to reconcile the discrepancy between the literal and intended meaning of an ironic remark.

Eighteen dyslexic children (ages 12~14) and 18 matched control children were tested, and the event-related potentials (ERPs) to real words and pseudo-words were recorded simultaneously with behavioral measures. The results showed that both groups had significantly longer response time for the pseudo-words. Furthermore, overall performance (in terms of lower accuracy and longer response time) was significantly worse among the dyslexic group during the lexical decision task. The differences between the dyslexic and control groups were mainly in the N130, RP, N400, and P600 components. The results suggest that Chinese dyslexic children have semantic processing defects. From a time course point of view, the early stages of processing reflect the Chinese dyslexic children’s morpheme integration and category sorting capacity deficiencies, while the middle stages show their semantic integration difficulties. The later stages of processing show that during semantic processing, decision-making is difficult among these children.

"Wang, Fang",2019,databases,Neural mechanisms underlying visual word recognition in reading,NaN,NaN,"Neural mechanisms underlying visual word recognition in reading, especially whether and how other linguistic information exerts influence on visual-orthographic processing, were investigated in the current thesis. Study 1 explored whether early stages of visual-orthographic processing can be modulated by different linguistic features based on different task demands. EEG data of 20 native Chinese speakers were recorded while participants performed three tasks: delayed naming, repetition detection, and blue color detection. Responses to familiar Chinese and unfamiliar Korean characters were compared. Results demonstrated that neural tuning to print is modulated by task demands already within the first 250ms, suggesting that early visual-orthographic processing may be less automatic than it was thought, and can be modulated by task top-down modulations during early stages. Study 2 examined the influence of category-level expectations on visual-orthographic processing. Familiar Chinese and unfamiliar Korean characters were used as stimulus conditions. Category-level expectations about the upcoming stimuli were manipulated with green and blue colored frames before stimulus onset. EEG data of 18 native Chinese speakers were recorded while participants performed an expectation judgment task. Results found that similar as the early task top-down modulations in study 1, category-level expectations started to take effect at early stages as well. The findings indicate that category-level expectations could also modulate early visual-orthographic processing even within 200 ms. Study 3 explored the influence of auditory-phonologic processing on visual-orthographic processing in at-risk children for developmental dyslexia using fMRI. 33 healthy, German speaking at-risk children (17 normal readers, 16 poor readers) participated in a behavioral and a combined EEG-fMRI session firstly in the middle of first grade and were followed up after one year of reading instruction at school. An implicit target detection task was employed and short nonwords (e.g., 'rof') were presented in an auditory and visual, and in a bimodal congruent and incongruent fashion. Audiovisual (AV) integration was investigated by comparing AV congruent to AV incongruent stimuli (congruency effect). Activation changes for the congruency effect from first to second grade can predict especially pseudoword reading performance improvement. Normal and poor reading groups differed in terms of functional coupling of left OT with the dorsal parietal attention network and the left OT coupling to frontal areas. These results provide evidence that audiovisual integration and the functional connection between phonological and orthographic brain areas differ between normal and poor reading at-risk for development dyslexia children, which may then present targets for early intervention in children showing poor reading development. Overall, the fMRI data and EEG data together can provide both localization and timing of how print is connected to other linguistic information (e.g., speech sound) in the developing and mature brain within different language contexts (i.e., opaque logographic Chinese and rather transparent alphabetic German).

Multivoxel pattern analysis was used to examine the correlation of patterns within a task (between runs) or across tasks. We found that the left middle temporal gyrus showed more similar patterns within the semantic task compared with across tasks, whereas there was no difference in the correlation within the syntactic task compared with across tasks, suggesting its specialization in semantic processing. Moreover, the left superior temporal gyrus showed more similar patterns within both the semantic task and the syntactic task as compared with across tasks, suggesting its role in integration of semantic and syntactic information. In contrast to the temporal lobe, we did not find specialization or integration effects in either the opercular or triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, our study showed that 5-to 6-year-old children have already developed specialization and integration in the temporal lobe, but not in the frontal lobe, consistent with developmental neurocognitive models of language comprehension in typically developing young children. © 2019 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,exclude,5.9,6,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Each subject performed an auditory description decision task. Using the artificial data as training data, incremental Principal Component Analysis was used in order to generate the feature space while overcoming memory requirements of large datasets. The nearest-neighbor classifier (NNC) and the distance-based fuzzy classifier (DFC) were used to perform group separation into left dominant, right dominant, bilateral, and others. The results show no effect of age, age at seizure onset, seizure duration, or seizure etiology on group separation. Two sets of parameters were significant for group separation, the patient vs. control populations and handedness. Of the 122 real datasets, 90 subjects gave the same classification results across all the methods (three raters, LI, bootstrap LI, NNC, and DFC). For the remaining datasets, 18 cases for the IPCA-NNC and 21 cases for the IPCA-DFC agreed with the majority of the five classification results (three visual ratings and two LI results). Kappa values vary from 0.59 to 0.73 for NNC and 0.61 to 0.75 for DFC, which indicate good agreement between NNC or DFC with traditional methods. The proposed method as designed can serve as an alternative method to corroborate existing LI and visual rating classification methods and to resolve some of the cases near the boundaries in between categories. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,exclude,8.65,12,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a nonpharmacologic therapeutic option for patients who have pharmaco-resistant Dravet syndrome (DS). Plentiful efforts have been made for delivering VNS to DS patients, but its effectiveness still requires further verification. We investigated the effectiveness of the VNS treatment of DS patients using brain connectivity analysis with electroencephalography (EEG). Approach. Twenty pharmaco-resistant DS patients were selected to undergo VNS implantation and classified into responder and non-responder groups after 24 months post-VNS. The effect of VNS between 6 months pre- A nd 6, 12, and 24 months post-VNS in all patients, responders, and non-responders on four different frequency categories of four brain parameters were compared using resting-state EEG. Main results. In alpha and beta bands, all patients showed positive results for characteristic path length (CPL), global efficiency (GE), and transitivity after VNS treatment, and changes in betweenness centrality (BC) were not significant. The difference in transitivity between responders and non-responders is more pronounced than those in CPL and GE are, in both the alpha (p < 0.015) and beta (p < 0.001) bands. There was an obvious change in BC, especially in the alpha band, as the hubs tended to move from frontal lobe to parietal lobe for responders; however, there was no change for the non-responders. Significance. We investigated the alteration in brain connectivity of DS patients in alpha and beta bands during a long-term follow-up and found the responders have a decreased transitivity after the VNS treatment. Moreover, the hubs with high values in the alpha band tended to move from frontal lobe to parietal lobe for responders after VNS treatment. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,25,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Methods: Fourteen children with AESD were recruited and categorized as group A (not receiving CsA) and group B (receiving CsA). Clinical course, laboratory data, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and outcome were analyzed retrospectively. We divided the patients into three types according to the distribution of abnormalities on MRI: frontal lobe predominant type, unilateral cerebral hemisphere type, and diffuse type. We used the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scale (PCPC) and the Pediatric Overall Performance Category scale (POPC) as prognostic measures. Results: Of the 14 children, five were boys (age range, 9-32 months). PCPC score was: 1 for seven patients, 2 for three patients, and 3 for four patients. There was no significant difference in PCPC between groups A and B (P = 0.293). POPC score was: 1 for six patients, 2 for five patients, and 3 for three patients.

The purpose of the study was to compare the brain activation patterns of normal and impaired readers on speech perception to better understand the phonological basis in reading disability. Whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded as good and poor readers, 7-13 years of age, performed an auditory word discrimination task. We used an auditory oddball paradigm in which the 'deviant' stimuli (/bat/, /kat/, /rat/) differed in the degree of phonological contrast (one versus three features) from a repeated standard word (/pat/). Both good and poor readers responded more slowly to deviants that were phonologically similar compared to deviants that were phonologically dissimilar to the standard word. Source analysis of the MEG data using minimum norm estimation (MNE) showed that compared to good readers, poor readers had reduced left-hemisphere activation to the most demanding phonological condition reflecting their difficulties with phonological processing. Furthermore, unlike good readers, poor readers did not show differences in activation as a function of the degree of phonological contrast. These results are consistent with a phonological account of reading disability. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,9.7,13,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In Experiment 1, subjects made category decisions to photographs, videos, and point-light displays of people and tools. In Experiment 2, subjects interpreted displays of simple, geometric shapes in motion depicting social or mechanical interactions. In both experiments, we found a selective deficit in the ASD subjects for dynamic social stimuli (videos and point-light displays of people, moving geometric shapes), but not static images, in the functionally localized lateral region of the right fusiform gyrus, including the fusiform face area. In contrast, no group differences were found in response to either static images or dynamic stimuli in other brain regions associated with face and social processing (e.g. posterior superior temporal sulcus, amygdala), suggesting disordered connectivity between these regions and the fusiform gyrus in ASD.

Despite this, there is currently little systematic evidence regarding the typical developmental trajectory for language from the field of neuroimaging. We reviewed functional MRI (fMRI) studies published between 1992 and 2014, and quantified the evidence for age-related changes in localisation and lateralisation of fMRI activation in the language network (excluding the cerebellum and subcortical regions). Although age-related changes differed according to task type and input modality, we identified four consistent findings concerning the typical maturation of the language system. First, activation in core semantic processing regions increases with age. Second, activation in lower-level sensory and motor regions increases with age as activation in higher-level control regions reduces. We suggest that this reflects increased automaticity of language processing as children become more proficient. Third, the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (regions associated with the default mode network) show increasing attenuation across childhood and adolescence. Finally, language lateralisation is established by approximately 5. years of age. Small increases in leftward lateralisation are observed in frontal regions, but these are tightly linked to performance. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Thirty-five typically developing children aged from 5 to 6 years performed auditory phonological (same sound judgment) and semantic (related meaning judgment) word-level tasks. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined specialization within the language network, by conducting three levels of analysis. First, we directly compared activation between tasks and found a greater sound judgment as compared to meaning judgment activation in left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and supramarginal gyrus. In contrast, greater meaning judgment as compared to sound judgment task activation was found in left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Second, we examined the brain-behavior correlations and found that phonological skill was correlated with the task difference in activation in left superior temporal sulcus, whereas semantic skill was correlated with the task difference in activation in left MTG. Third, we compared between two experimental conditions within each task and found a parametric effect in left STG for the sound judgment task, and a parametric effect in left MTG for the meaning judgment task. The results of this study indicate that, by the age of 5–6 years, typically developing children already show some specialization of temporo-parietal brain regions for phonological and semantic processes.

This could affect the clinical validity of fMRI for presurgical language lateralization. The current study sets out to identify if a systematic effect of lesion type and localization on fMRI exists. Methods: We classify lesions typically occurring in epilepsy patients according to (1) their potential to disturb blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-effect generation or detection or to disturb spatial brain normalization, and (2) the proximity of lesions to protocol-specific volumes of interest (VOIs). The effect of lesions is evaluated through the examination of 238 epilepsy patients and a subgroup of 37 patients with suspected unilateral left-language dominance according to the Wada test. Results: Patients with fMRI-critical lesions such as cavernomas, gliomas, and mass defects close to VOIs, or with severe atrophy, show lower lateralization indices (LIs) and more often discordant language lateralization with the Wada test than do patients without such lesions.

"Wenger, Kristin Kay",2008,databases,Functional anatomical development of task set processes: An fMRI examination,NaN,NaN,"During development, it is likely that many substantial changes in cognitive abilities are driven, in part, by the increased ability to configure information processing pathways for task performance. This research investigates the developmental functional neuroanatomy of processes underlying task instantiation and maintenance, termed task set processes. These processes, originating in the task set system and identifiable by transient and sustained profiles of neural activity, provide top-down control in order to influence moment-to-moment processing in the brain's data processing systems. This dissertation describes two experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The first experiment established that both transient and sustained signals could be compared between adults and 7- to 8-year-old children performing a visual experiment. Significant between-group differences were observed neither for transient nor for sustained activity in visual cortex. These results indicate that, in cognitive experiments, between-group differences in transient and sustained activity may be more readily ascribed to age-related differences in information processing rather than to physiological differences underlying the measured signals. In the second experiment in this dissertation, adults and 7- to 9-year-old children performed a task requiring living/non-living category judgments on pictures. Two main conclusions are supported by the data. First, many task set processes appear to be established in children by ages 7-9: children exhibit activity in putative adult task set regions, as shown through both a meta-analytic approach and through a direct comparison of adult and child data. The second conclusion is that, in spite of similarity in task set processes, the interaction of the task set system with the data processing systems appears different for adults and children. It is discussed that adults may place a greater emphasis on a visual processing strategy than do children. Overall, results indicate that the brain's task set system and data processing systems may follow different developmental trajectories, with earlier establishment of more general task control processes.

Epidemiology and risk factors for stroke in these patients are not well characterized. Methods We analyzed pediatric (<18 years) cardiac ECMO cases in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry from 2002 to 2013. Cardiac surgical patients were identified, and procedures were stratified according to The Society of Thoracic Surgeons morbidity categories. The primary outcome was any stroke (hemorrhagic or infarction) identified by neuroimaging. Risk factors were identified through multivariable logistic regression. Results We analyzed 3,517 cardiac surgical patients; 81% with cyanotic disease, and 57% in high-risk categories from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (categories 4 and 5). Overall, 12% experienced stroke while receiving ECMO, and those with stroke had greater in-hospital mortality (72% versus 51%; p < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, neonatal status (adjusted odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.4), lower weight-for-age z score (adjusted odds ratio, 1.1 for each 1-point decrease; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.25), and longer ECMO duration (upper quartile [≥167 hours] adjusted odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.8) were independently associated with increased stroke risk, whereas cyanotic disease, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons category, and bypass time were not. Conclusions This multicenter analysis demonstrates that pediatric cardiac surgical patients on ECMO are at high risk of stroke; younger or underweight patients and those with longer ECMO duration are at greatest risk, independent of procedural complexity.

"Westphal, Alexander R. N.",2014,databases,The place of childhood disintegrative disorder on the autism spectrum,NaN,NaN,"The use of the term 'spectrum' to describe autism spectrum disorders (ASD) captures the heterogeneity of presentations, including differences in cognitive level and onset pattern, but also implies homogeneity of pathophysiology. Most research on ASD has been conducted on subjects with intact cognitive function, and has been thought to be generalizable to the low functioning population. However, the rarest ASD, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD), has a pattern of onset unlike other ASDs, and is also associated with the severest intellectual and adaptive disabilities of any spectrum disorder, raising the possibility that there may be a pathophysiological pathway to autistic behavior in some low functioning individuals different than the one defined in the high functioning population. Very little is known about CDD, in part because of its rarity, and the utility of the diagnostic category has been questioned. The purpose of this thesis was to examine relationship between CDD and the autism spectrum in several ways. The first several chapters include a literature review and a clinical description of a group of children with CDD seen at the Yale Child Study Center. The clinical description includes information about the characteristics of the onset of CDD, and comparisons of outcome between CDD and other ASDs. The following chapters are an eye-tracking study and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study that compare the way in which subjects with CDD process faces relative to people with other forms of ASD and typical development. Although subjects with CDD do appear similar to other subjects with ASD and low IQ on a variety of clinical measures, the findings demonstrate that they have a distinct way of exploring faces, focusing on the eyes even more so than typical subjects, and they also have differences in their brain activations to faces and houses. Together the eye-tracking and fMRI results suggest the possibility that vestiges of typical brain function exist in subjects with CDD, despite the severity of their autism symptoms. Overall, the findings emphasize the value or maintaining a diagnostic distinction between CDD and other forms of ASD until the evidence says otherwise.

As such, the development of this ability during childhood is thought to promote learning. Here, we sought to better understand the mechanisms by which analogical reasoning about semantic relations improves over childhood and adolescence (e.g. chalk is to chalkboard as pen is to…?). We hypothesized that age-related differences would manifest as differences in the brain regions associated with one or more of the following cognitive functions: (1) controlled semantic retrieval, or the ability to retrieve task-relevant semantic associations; (2) response control, or the ability to override the tendency to respond to a salient distractor; and/or (3) relational integration, or the ability to consider jointly two mental relations. In order to test these hypotheses, we analyzed patterns of fMRI activation during performance of a pictorial propositional analogy task across 95 typically developing children between the ages of 6 and 18 years old. Despite large age-related differences in task performance, particularly over ages 6–10 but through to around age 14, participants across the whole age range recruited a common network of frontal, parietal and temporal regions. However, activation in a brain region that has been implicated in controlled semantic retrieval – left anterior prefrontal cortex (BA 47/45) – was positively correlated with age, and also with performance after controlling for age. This finding indicates that improved performance over middle childhood and early adolescence on this analogical reasoning task is driven largely by improvements in the ability to selectively retrieve task-relevant semantic relationships. © 2017 The Authors.

Here, we aimed at developing new paradigms for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for assessment of language dominance that can be used in younger children and allow for performance monitoring. Two new tasks (letter and animal task) were developed and compared to two reference tasks (synonyms and verb generation task) from the literature. Overall, 23 healthy children participated (13 boys, 10 girls, 10.2 T 2.5 years, range 6.1-15.3 years). Analysis was done using statistical nonparametrical mapping (SnPM2) on SPM2. Both reference tasks show activation in a number of left-frontal brain regions. The letter task induced a very localized activation in the left hemisphere's Broca's region, while not activating other frontal brain regions. Lateralization (as assessed in different anatomically and functionally defined regions) was consistent and strong. The animal task failed to activate frontal brain regions and was not suitable for assessing language dominance in children in this form. We conclude that while both reference tasks are useful for determining language dominance, they coactivate a number of taskrelated frontal areas not directly involved in language processing. Additionally, one task is not applicable in young children while the other does not allow performance monitoring.

Advances in neuroimaging since the 1980s, however, as well as an ever-increasing number of reported cases, have made this system outdated. Sacrococcygeal eversion is a condition in which the distal sacral and coccygeal vertebrae are curved in a retroverted rather than anteverted direction. It can give rise to one type of caudal appendage. Sacrococcygeal eversion has never been associated with spinal cord tethering in any previously published reports. Methods: We reviewed all cases of caudal appendage encountered by pediatric neurosurgeons at Children’s Hospital Colorado since 2000 in which the appendage would be classified as a true tail by the most commonly used system mentioned above. We also reviewed cases of sacrococcygeal eversion encountered since 2000 by the same group of pediatric neurosurgeons. We searched the hospital electronic medical record system for additional appendages using the terms “caudal appendage” and “persistent human tail.” Results: We found 9 “true” tails (as classified by the most commonly used system). All 9 were associated with tethering or possible tethering of the spinal cord and 6 were associated with a low-lying conus medullaris. There were 8 cases of sacrococcygeal eversion, including 2 associated with Apert or Pfeiffer syndrome and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) mutations; these have previously been reported. There was a single case of sacrococcygeal eversion associated with Goldenhar or Turner syndrome; the former was associated with a potentially tethering lesion. Four cases of sacrococcygeal eversion not associated with any known syndrome were also found; two of these were associated with tethering or potentially tethering lesions. Conclusions: Most so-called true tails are likely cutaneous markers for spinal dysraphism and spinal cord tethering and are not remnants of the embryonic human tail. Sacrococcygeal eversion can be associated with spinal cord tethering. Based on our cases, and on review of the literature, we devised a five-category classification system for caudal appendages: (1) soft-tissue caudal appendages, (2) bony caudal appendages, (3) bony caudal prominences, (4) true tails, and (5) “other” caudal appendages. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
"Williams, Adina",2019,databases,Representing relationality: Meg studies on argument structure,NaN,NaN,"One of the quintessential properties of the human semantic system is its ability to flexibly combine the meanings of smaller pieces into larger wholes. However, not all smaller conceptual pieces are created equal; concepts differ in the extent to which they can drive meaning composition. Some concepts can drive semantic composition by establishing relationships with other concepts, while others cannot. For example, we know the concept labelled by 'friend' can drive composition, since one cannot be a friend without being someone's friend, while an animal can be a cat without standing in a similar relationship. We can thus divide the conceptual space of humans into two sections: relational concepts labelled by words like 'friend', and non-relational concepts like the one labelled by 'cat'. Evidence in favor of this division indicates that in early childhood humans are aware of the relationality of concepts (Smiley and Brown 1979; Mirman and Graziano 2012), and as we age, relational concepts remain extremely common in our lexicon, making up nearly half of the adult English vocabulary (Asmuth and Gentner, 2005; Gentner, 2005). Some relational words have been extensively studied by cognitive psychologists and formal linguists alike. One relatively mature set of investigations utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural basis of relational verb meaning, and finds that relational (i.e., transitive) verbs drive activity in left perisylvian cortical regions more than their intransitive counterparts (Meltzer-Asscher et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2010, 2007; Bornkessel et al., 2005; Ben-Shachar et al., 2003). These investigations attribute this activity to verb-specific or event-specific information that is stored as part of the verb's conceptual representation. Some support for this comes from Binder and Desai 2011 that holds that the left AG is a main semantic hub that specializes in event processing. However, formal linguistic investigations suggest that relationality should be independent of verbhood or eventivity; it is an independent abstract property of some lexical items which enables them to establish relationships and drive semantic composition. The neural basis of relationality and whether it can be independent of verbhood and eventivity is still relatively underexplored. As relationality straddles the boundary between syntax and semantics, disentangling the contributions of various linguistic features, such as syntactic category, eventivity, and plurality to left AG activity becomes a crucial exercise---one that a linguist is uniquely poised to address. A main candidate region for relational processing is the left Angular Gyrus (lAG), because prior literature suggests it is sensitive to at least some of the features that a region that processes relationality would be sensitive to. In addition to being implicated in tasks that probe the argument structure of verbs, the left AG was found to be the most consistently activated region across numerous semantic tasks in a recent, large-scale meta-analysis (Binder and Desai, 2011), prompting it to be dubbed a domain-general 'semantic' hub (Bonner et al., 2013; Binder and Desai, 2011). Because of this, this dissertation reports the results of three MEG experiments and one computational experiment, and focuses on the left AG and surrounding perisylvian cortical regions, and uses Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate its role in relational processing. Chapter 2 asks whether left AG tracks relationality, the eventivity of verbs, or a word's combinatorial context, and finds a main effect of relationality from 170--260 ms after the visual presentation of the target noun, and no other effects of the other factors, suggesting that it is indeed relationality and not eventivity (or context) that drives left AG argument structure findings.

"Williamson, Brady J.",2020,databases,Towards connectionist neuroimaging: Brain connector hubs for expressive language,NaN,NaN,"Many models attempting to characterize the neural correlates of cognition focus on localizing functions, but few address the question of how the localized regions take part in the network as a whole. Models of language in the brain have existed for nearly 150 years and most fall into this category. While early research was limited to postmortem studies of pathology, the advent of neuroimaging has allowed researchers to investigate brain function in vivo and in healthy populations as well as those with pathology. Even with this advance, many researchers have still largely focused on localization of function. Recently, there has been a paradigmatic shift from activation-based to connectivity-based analyses of neuroimaging data, emphasizing investigation of how different brain regions interact. When conceptualizing the brain as a network, some regions emerge as important for communication between functionally specialized neural populations. These areas are known as connector hubs. While connector hubs have been acknowledged for several years, they are rarely characterized, especially in the context of a specific cognitive function. The current study aims to characterize connector hubs in the pediatric language network, observe their developmental trajectory, and assess their relationship with age-corrected language performance. Data from an existing study were used that included neuroimaging (MRI, fMRI, diffusion MRI or dMRI, MEG) and standardized language assessment (EVT) data for 15 young children (4-6 years) and 15 adolescents (16-18 years). A data-driven, connectivity-based pipeline was developed to characterize connector hubs during an expressive language task. After initial preprocessing, connectivity matrices were calculated for MEG (functional) and dMRI (structural) data. Functional connectivity was calculated using amplitude-amplitude correlation (AAC) within and between 4 different frequency bins (2-4, 4-12, 12-30, 30-100 Hz) to capture intra- and inter- frequency connectivity. Each functional connectivity matrix was then multiplied (entry-wise) by a threholded and binarized structural connectivity matrix to keep only biologically-plausible connections. Finally, the matrices were combined into a multilayer network and graph analyses were performed to identify connector hubs. Results showed good overlap of connector hubs with vetted fMRI-derived maps, though the current pipeline was more consistent across individuals. Additionally, connector hub distribution became more left lateralized, cortical, and focal, with age. Connector hubs in regions thought to be involved in expressive language were significantly correlated with EVT performance in adolescents but not young children. Overall, the results suggest that the expressive language network becomes more focal and efficient during development, a process potentially mediated by central and subcortical regions. Comprehensive characterization of connector hubs and how they change during childhood has important clinical and computational applications. Cutting-edge neuroimaging analyses combined with new developments in connectionist modeling may lead to a better understanding of how neurophysiology leads to cognition.

Multi-voxel pattern analysis within verb-specific regions showed indistinguishable  activity patterns for English and Spanish, indicating language-invariant bilingual  processing. In LMTG and LMFG, patterns were more similar within than across  grammatical category, both within and across languages, indicating  language-invariant grammatical class information.

The observance of specific behaviors in multiple settings have remained the most successful method for diagnosing the condition, and although there are differences in specific areas of the brain, and a high heritability estimate (∼76%), they are not diagnostically specific. Medications, and particularly stimulant medication, have undergone rigorous studies to document their efficacy dating back to the 1970s. Likewise, behavioral interventions in the form of parent training and classroom programs have demonstrated robust efficacy during the same time period. Both medication and behavioral interventions are symptomatic treatments. The availability of only symptomatic treatments places ADHD in the same category as other chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma. Successful treatment of most individuals requires ongoing adherence to the therapy. Improved communication between patients and their families, primary and mental health providers, and school personnel is necessary for effective ADHD treatment. Further enhancement of electronic systems to facilitate family, school, and provider communication can improve monitoring of ADHD symptoms and functional performance.

To evaluate the amount of reduction in radiation exposure by using this LDSS protocol compared to their usual protocol, the authors prospectively documented their findings. Methods: From May 2010 to June 2011, paediatric neurosurgical patients requiring CT brain, and when it was not a clinical emergency and there was baseline CT or MRI brain available, were evaluated for the LDSS protocol. The LDSS protocol used a lower tube current-time product and a shorter scan length to attain a lower total radiation dose. The CT scanning parameters of the patients' usual CT brain and LDSS CT were recorded and compared. Adverse events were also recorded. Results: A total of 24 paediatric patients were included. Using the LDSS protocol, the effective doses were between 9% and 80% of the usual protocol and, in 20 patients, ≤50% of the usual protocol. The tube voltage was 120 kV. For patients below 10 years old, 100 mA s was adequate for the purposes of their CTs; in some patient categories, it was lower than 100 mA s. For patients aged 10 or above, 150 mA s was used.

"Woo, Theresa Teslovich",2015,databases,Self-control from 4 to 40,NaN,NaN,"In our society, immediate gratification of needs and desires can be met across almost any domain. Whether one engages in these behaviors for pleasure or to reduce psychological pain, what may seem rewarding in the present may lead to long term suffering in the future when weight, substance abuse or other related health problems develop. Our youth are particularly vulnerable to these influences with the high prevalence of obesity in our elementary schools and illicit drug use already beginning in our middle schools. It is increasingly clear that early appearing self-regulatory abilities are associated with these behaviors and ultimately with long-term mental and physical health. However the core psychological constructs and neural substrates of self-regulation are not well understood. While self-control is typically described as a construct that increases linearly with age, recent studies have implicated the role of motivational cues in modulating an individual's capacity to self-regulate. This thesis examines the influence of motivational cues on self-control from childhood into adulthood. Namely, how motivational cues in our environment impact self-control and how their influence might vary across development and among individuals. Using a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging techniques we have found motivational cues can influence behavior in a number of ways. Specifically, developmental effects in both overall impulse control and sensitivity to motivational cues, result in differential modulation of behavior depending on age and class of motivator. While we have found food cue to be fairly consistent in salience across age groups and coincided with an overall increase in cognitive control abilities, rewards in the form of points, differentially modulated decision-making in adolescents and adults. Contrary to prior research that suggests teens are a hedonistically driven by their hypersensitivity to rewards, incapable of making good decisions, we observed an enhancement of behavior in adolescents when large rewards were at stake. In addition to the developmental effects of cue-mediated self-regulation, we investigate the extent to which motivational cues influence behavior on an individual level. Differences in appetitive cue sensitivity established early in life were found to influence long-term cognitive control abilities. This provocative correlation was associated with distinct patterns of activity in frontrostriatal circuitry and proposes a mechanism for self-regulation that incorporates individual sensitivity to appetitive cues in our environment. These findings suggest that the salience of a specific category of cues (e.g., food, rewards, and social cues) changes across development and speaks to the importance of enhancing self-control to these cues in special populations where this ability may be compromised or diminished (e.g., obesity, bulimia, anorexia nervosa).

Previous research has shown that the left medial temporal lobe (MTL) and the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) are the primary brain regions activated during both verbal encoding and the association of disparate semantic concepts. In the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, our goal was to compare the coordinated response of the left MTL and left PFC when disparate semantic associations are strongly encoded compared to when they are weakly encoded. To achieve this goal, subjects were scanned while creating sentences based on a presented pair of words, and were asked to free-recall these sentences at a later time. Half the word pairs were semantically unrelated, and half were semantically related. Analysis of relatedness activations (unrelated-related contrast) suggested that the PFC was active whether or not the items were free-recalled, and increased activation of the MTL was required to promote encoding. Analyses of coordination of relatedness activations comparing free-recalled items to not free-recalled items showed an increase in left MTL-left PFC coordination for relatedness activations on free-recalled items. These results suggest that formation of relational semantic associations that lead to strongly encoded episodes requires increased coordination of the left MTL-left PFC neural pathway. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Accurate identification of the syndrome is important for optimal treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of asymmetric Meckel cave enlargement, a potential novel imaging marker, in a population of patients referred for evaluation of possible PHACES syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients referred for neuroimaging evaluation of possible PHACES syndrome were identified and stratified on the basis of their ultimate clinical PHACES diagnosis categorization into PHACES, possible PHACES, or not PHACES. MR imaging studies were subsequently reviewed for the presence or absence of unilateral Meckel cave enlargement, with the reviewer blinded to the ultimate PHACES syndrome categorization. RESULTS: Twenty-five of 85 patients (29%) were ultimately categorized as having PHACES or possible PHACES according to consensus guidelines. Asymmetric Meckel cave enlargement was present in 76% (19/25) of these patients and in 82% (19/23) of only those patients with definite PHACES. This finding was present in none of the 60 patients determined not to have PHACES syndrome. In 7/19 patients (37%) with this finding, subtle MR imaging abnormalities consistent with PHACES were missed on the initial MR imaging interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: Asymmetric Meckel cave enlargement was a common feature of patients with PHACES in our cohort and may serve as a novel imaging marker.

The activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method was used to analyze eight studies in the orthographic task category, eleven in the phonological and fifteen in the semantic task categories. Converging activation among three language-processing components was found in the left middle frontal gyrus, the left superior parietal lobule and the left mid-fusiform gyrus, suggesting a common sub-network underlying the character recognition process regardless of the task nature.

Moreover, bilateral involvement of the ventral occipito-temporal regions was found for both phonological and semantic processing.

Correlation analysis between resting-state functional connectivity and sentence processing performance in 5-year-olds revealed that local connectivity within the left IFG is associated with competence of processing syntactically simple canonical sentences, while long-range connectivity between IFG and pSTS in left hemisphere is associated with competence of processing syntactically relatively more complex non-canonical sentences. The present developmental data suggest that a selective left fronto-temporal connectivity network for processing complex syntax is already in functional connection at the age of 5 years when measured in a non-task situation. The correlational findings provide new insight into the relationship between intrinsic functional connectivity and syntactic language abilities in preschool children. © 2015 The Authors.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,5.5,5,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Intelligences were divided into two categories, verbal and performance intelligences, for statistical investigations. Statistical analyses of the noncontaminated QEEG dataset investigated the differentiability of each frequency on a single cortical region and coherence between cortical regions. Low QEEG frequencies were found to have a significant correlation with intelligences on some cortical regions. Coherence between symmetric cortical regions was found to be an important factor in predicting intelligences.

This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of a combined model based on brain computed tomography (CT) and initial blood gas analysis to predict neurologic prognoses in pediatric patients after cardiac arrest. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest from 2000 to 2018. Patients aged one month to 18 years were included. Gray to white matter ratio (GWR), ambient cistern effacement (ACE), and blood gas analysis were studied. The primary outcome was neurological prognosis, which was evaluated using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) scale at discharge. Results: Of 97 resuscitated patients, 64 brain CT images were available. Fourteen patients had a good neurologic outcome (PCPC 1–3) and 50 patients a poor neurologic outcome (PCPC 4–6). The multimodal model (AUC 0.897) containing GWR of basal ganglia (BG), ACE, and blood pH was found to be superior for predicting poor neurologic prognosis than single variable models (AUC of GWR-BG: 0.744, ACE: 0.804, pH: 0.747). Interestingly, we found the GWR-BG cutoff value for specificity 100% differed significantly between patients <4 years (cutoff value: 1.08, p = 0.04) and ≥4 years (cutoff value: 1.18, p = 0.004). Conclusions: The combination of GWR-BG, ambient cistern effacement, and blood pH was found to usefully predict neurological outcome in children resuscitated from cardiac arrest. In addition, the cutoff value of GWR-BG for the prediction of neurologic outcome was found to increase with age. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,18,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

This review provides an overview of the multimodal imaging approach, and then provides a snapshot of how multimodal imaging has been applied in the study of ASD to date. This body of work is separated into two categories: one concerning whole brain connectomics and the other focused on characterizing neural circuits implicated as altered in ASD.

However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this impairment. Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that the lateral frontal cortex plays a key role in flexible word retrieval. Thus, we examined whether individuals with ASD exhibited altered frontal processing during the category fluency test using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-two adolescents with high-functioning ASD (20 males) and 22 typically developing (TD) adolescents (16 males) aged 11–18 years were recruited. All underwent a category fluency paradigm, which required production of animal or means of transportation words for 1 min each although their frontal hemodynamic changes were recorded with fNIRS. We found that adolescents with ASD produced fewer animal but not transportation words (group-by-category interaction: P = 0.003), suggesting differential word retrieval impairment. In addition, unlike TD adolescents who exhibited activation primarily in lateral frontal regions during word production, adolescents with ASD had comparable activation across lateral and medial frontal regions. More importantly, this lack of lateral–medial distinction of activation, which was associated with poor word retrieval, differed significantly between groups only in the animal category (group-by-category interaction: P = 0.018). Thus, our findings implicate frontal lobe dysfunction in the impairment of differential word retrieval in adolescents with ASD. The relatively greater involvement of the medial frontopolar cortex might reflect the use of nonspecialized brain regions to compensate for the category-dependent difficulties with word retrieval in ASD.

Lay Summary: Using an optical imaging tool, we found that adolescents with autism had difficulties with producing semantically related words and exhibited frontal lobe dysfunction. Nonetheless, poor word production and altered brain processing was only seen when these adolescents were asked to produce words from a category of living things but not nonliving things (i.e., animals but not means of transportation).

Male adolescents (n = 23; mean age 15.1 ± 3.6 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of AD were compared with a normal male control group with similar demographic characteristics (n = 43; mean age: 15.1 ± 3.6 years). A computerized neurocognitive battery was administered and included: Inspection Time (IT), Finger Tapping Test (FTT), Simple Reaction Time (SRT), Choice Reaction Time (CRT), Digit Running task (DRT), Stroop test and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Adolescents with AD performed significantly worse than controls on the DSST. This impaired DSST performance was related to cognitive mechanisms different from those employed by normal controls. Motor slowness and inability to deal with increased amounts of information affected the performance of the AD group, while shifting of attention was the limiting factor in the controls. Both groups were similarly dependent on response selection. This study demonstrated differences in performance in complex cognitive tasks between adolescents with AD and normal controls that may be related to differences in neurocognitive mechanisms underlying information processing. Future neuroimaging studies are needed to clarify the neural network involved in the differences in cognitive performance between AD subjects and normal controls. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: The authors analyzed the ictal EEG of 395 seizures in 43 patients with complex partial seizures. Based on EEG findings the patients were classified according to the degree of localization of their onset areas. The results were then compared with neuroimaging findings. Results: Only 10 patients fell into the category 'discrete', meaning that all the onset areas (as measured by ictal EEG) were localized in the same lobe of the same hemisphere. Seven patients were categorized as 'lateralized', meaning that all the onset areas were clearly lateralized in the same hemisphere but without consistent localization. Eleven patients were classified as 'localized', meaning that the onset area were localized simultaneously in bilateral same lobes, or changed consistently from one lobe in one hemisphere to the same lobe in the opposite hemisphere. The onset area could not be defined in 15 patients and these were categorized as 'not defined'. No patient who underwent seven or more ictal recordings was categorized as discrete. However, when confined only to those patients in whom over 75% of the ictal recordings showed the same onset area, there was a high correlation between the epileptogenic lesions detected by ictal EEG and those detected by neuroimaging techniques. Conclusions: The findings of the present study indicate that ictal EEG recordings are useful for determining the epileptogenic area in epilepsy with complex partial seizures, provided that more than 75% of the ictal recordings show the same ictal onset area.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,19,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

In this work, we apply a multi-modal imaging  machine-learning framework to enhance AD classification and prediction of diagnosis  of subject-matched gray matter MRI and Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET data related  to 58 AD, 108 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 120 healthy elderly (HE) subjects  from the Australian imaging, biomarkers and lifestyle (AIBL) dataset. Specifically,  we combined a Dartel algorithm to enhance anatomical registration with multi-kernel  learning (MKL) technique, yielding an average of >95% accuracy for three binary  classification problems: AD-vs.-HE, MCI-vs.-HE and AD-vs.-MCI, a considerable  improvement from individual modality approach. Consistent with t-contrasts, the MKL  weight maps revealed known brain regions associated with AD, i.e.,  (para)hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral temporal gyrus.  Importantly, MKL regression analysis provided excellent predictions of diagnosis of  individuals by r(2) = 0.86. In addition, we found significant correlations between  the MKL classification and delayed memory recall scores with r(2) = 0.62 (p < 0.01).  Interestingly, outliers in the regression model for diagnosis were mainly converter  samples with a higher likelihood of converting to the inclined diagnostic category.  Overall, our work demonstrates the successful application of MKL with Dartel on  combined neuromarkers from different neuroimaging modalities in the AIBL data.

Spontaneous use of elaborative strategies, which can enhance the recall of information, expands with age and contributes to age-associated improvement in memory functioning. Findings from lesion and neuroimaging studies suggest that the ability to use elaborative strategies is dependent upon intact functioning of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly the dorsolateral PFC region. Because the PFC undergoes protracted maturation, we examined whether age difference in the structure of the PFC is correlated with age-associated increase in strategy use. Here, we investigated the relationship between PFC volume and spontaneous strategy use in a sample of 120 participants aged 5–25 years. We assessed semantic clustering during recall with a standardized word-list recall task (California Verbal Learning Task children's version, CVLT-C) and computed PFC regional volumes from participants’ structural brain images. We observed an age-associated increase in the use of semantic clustering and an age-associated decrease in volumes of the PFC. Further, we found that smaller PFC volume was linked to increased use of semantic clustering. Importantly, the volume of the right dorsolateral PFC partially explained the relation between age and the use of semantic clustering. These findings suggest that PFC maturation supports the development of strategy use and lends further support for the notion that brain-behavior relations change across development. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,13.79,25,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Dishabituation - responses to non-habituated stimuli - can provide a window into the structure of these categories, without requiring an overt task. Methods: We used an event-related fMR1 design with short interval habituation trials, in which trains of stimuli were presented passively during 1.5 second intervals of relative silence between clustered scans. Trains of four identical stimuli (standard trials) and trains of three identical stimuli followed by a stimulus from a different phonetic category (deviant trials) were presented. This paradigm allowed us to measure and compare the time course of overall responses to speech, and responses to phonetic change. Results: Comparisons between responses to speech and silence revealed strong responses throughout the extent of superior temporal gyrus (STG) bilaterally. Comparisons between deviant and standard trials revealed dishabituation responses in a restricted region of left posterior STG, near the border with supramarginal gyrus (SMG). Novelty responses to deviant trials were also observed in right frontal regions and hippocampus. Conclusion: A passive, dishabituation paradigm provides results similar to studies requiring overt responses. This paradigm can readily be extended for the study of pre-attentive processing of speech in populations such as children and second-language learners whose overt behavior is often difficult to interpret because of ancillary task demands. © 2005 Zevin and McCandliss; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,26.8,38,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

We recently published a study of prevalence and risk factors in school-aged children in three mountainous areas in Sichuan province of western China. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) on data from that study to guide intervention planning, here we examine risk factors grouped into three broad interventional categories: sociodemographics, human behavior, and sources of pork and pig husbandry. Because neuroimaging is not easily available, using SEM allows for the use of multiple observed variables (serological tests and symptoms) to represent probable NCC cases. Data collected from 2608 students was included in this analysis. Within this group, seroprevalence of cysticercosis IgG antibodies was 5.4%. SEM results showed that sociodemographic factors (β = 0.33, p < 0.05), sources of pork and pig husbandry (β = 0.26, p < 0.001), and behavioral factors (β = 0.33, p < 0.05) were all directly related to probable NCC in school-aged children. Sociodemographic factors affected probable NCC indirectly via sources of pork and pig husbandry factors (β = 0.07, p < 0.001) and behavioral variables (β = 0.07, p < 0.001). Both sociodemographic factors (β = 0.07, p < 0.05) and sources of pork and pig husbandry factors (β = 0.10, p < 0.01) affected probable NCC indirectly via behavioral variables. Because behavioral variables not only had a large direct effect but also served as a critical bridge to strengthen the effect of sociodemographics and sources of pork and pig husbandry on probable NCC, our findings suggest that interventions targeting behavioral factors may be the most effective in reducing disease. © 2019 by the authors.

Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis can quantitatively synthesize the data from multiple studies and minimize the interstudy or intersubject differences. In this study, we performed two ALE meta-analysis experiments: one was to examine the neural activation patterns of the phonological processing of two different types of written languages and the other was to examine the development characteristics of such neural activation patterns based on both alphabetic language and logographic language data. The results of our first meta-analysis experiment were consistent with the meta-analysis which was based on the studies published before 2005.

Maturational profiles of face specialization during typical development,Brain and Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.464,"Introduction: Face processing undergoes significant developmental change with age. Two kinds of developmental changes in face specialization were examined in this study: specialized maturation, or the continued tuning of a region to faces but little change in the tuning to other categories; and competitive interactions, or the continued tuning to faces accompanied by decreased tuning to nonfaces (i.e., pruning). Methods: Using fMRI, in regions where adults showed a face preference, a face- and object-specialization index were computed for younger children (5–8 years), older children (9–12 years) and adults (18–45 years). The specialization index was scaled to each subject's maximum activation magnitude in each region to control for overall age differences in the activation level. Results: Although no regions showed significant face specialization in the younger age group, regions strongly associated with social cognition (e.g., right posterior superior temporal sulcus, right inferior orbital cortex) showed specialized maturation, in which tuning to faces increased with age but there was no pruning of nonface responses. Conversely, regions that are associated with more basic perceptual processing or motor mirroring (right middle temporal cortex, right inferior occipital cortex, right inferior frontal opercular cortex) showed competitive interactions in which tuning to faces was accompanied by pruning of object responses with age. Conclusions: The overall findings suggest that cortical maturation for face processing is regional-specific and involves both increased tuning to faces and diminished response to nonfaces. Regions that show competitive interactions likely support a more generalized function that is co-opted for face processing with development, whereas regions that show specialized maturation increase their tuning to faces, potentially in an activity-dependent, experience-driven manner. © 2016 The Authors.

Network nodes identified from eight widely replicated functional intrinsic connectivity networks served as seed regions to map whole-brain structural covariance patterns in each age group. In general, structural covariance in the youngest age group was limited to seed and contralateral homologous regions. Networks derived using primary sensory and motor cortex seeds were already well-developed in early childhood but expanded in early adolescence before pruning to a more restricted topology resembling adult intrinsic connectivity network patterns.

More recent research indicates that oxytocin may have broader pro-social effects on behavior and cognition, which points towards oxytocin's potential as an agent to help improve social cognition and functioning in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. However, new research on oxytocin has also uncovered a 'darker side', including oxytocin's possible role in social out-grouping and envy. Instead of a simple view of oxytocin as 'good' or 'bad', a more accurate depiction of oxytocin's role in social processing likely involves the presence of moderating factors. We review moderation effects in oxytocin and their implications for psychiatry. One implication is that, across diagnostic categories, oxytocin administration may have positive effects for patients with social cognitive deficits but negative effects for patients with social cognitive bias. We conclude that future intervention studies should use methods such as signal detection to measure both deficit and bias parameters of social cognition and to evaluate potential individual and contextual moderators both within and between psychiatric diagnoses in order to determine for whom oxytocin treatment may be beneficial and for whom it may actually be harmful. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

More precisely, we propose a method to analyze similarities and differences in functional connectivity between children and young adults. Often, analysis is conducted on each class separately, and differences across classes are identified with an additional postprocessing step using adequate statistical tools. Here, we propose to rely on a generalized fused Lasso penalty, which allows us to make use of the entire data set in order to estimate connectivity patterns that are either shared across classes, or specific to a given group. By using the entire population during the estimation, we hope to increase the power of our analysis. The proposed model falls in the category of population-wise matrix decomposition, and a simple and efficient alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is introduced to solve the associated optimization problem. After validating our approach on simulated data, experiments are performed on resting-state fMRI imaging from the Philadelphia neurodevelopmental cohort data set, comprised of normally developing children from ages 8 to 21. Developmental differences were observed in various brain regions, as a total of three class-specific resting-state components were identified. Statistical analysis of the estimated subject-specific features, as well as classification results (based on age groups, up to 81% accuracy, n = 583 samples) related to these components demonstrate that the proposed method is able to properly extract meaningful shared and class-specific sub-networks. © 2017 IEEE.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,11.1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Behavioural and neurophysiological findings from both prospective and retrospective memory research suggest that the efficiency of encoding processes is reduced at both ends of the lifespan and that neural generators underlying successful encoding might differ in childhood and old age. Hence, the present study investigates compensational neural mechanisms during the encoding of intentions in adolescents and old adults compared to young adults. Methods: We compared Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) and their source localization in 14 adolescents (11-13 years), 14 young adults (18-25 years), and 14 old adults (64-79 years) in a prospective memory task that was embedded in a semantic categorization task. Results: Our data revealed three event-related modulations that differentiate between conditions (i.e., ongoing activity and successful intention formation trials) and groups. Source localizations of these modulations with standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) revealed compensational activations in adolescents and old adults compared to young adults in successful intention formation trials: while adolescents showed a higher activation of secondary occipital regions in the time window of 500-1200. msec with a maximum around 800. msec, old adults activated prefrontal regions to a greater extent beginning at 700. msec, persisting until 1200. msec and expanding to middle temporal regions. Conclusion: For a successful encoding of intentions adolescents and old adults recruit more neural generators than young adults. More importantly, the pattern of these compensational activations is different when comparing adolescents with young adults and old adults with young adults. These differences are discussed with regard to differential maturational changes in the brain. © 2009 Elsevier Srl.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,12.8,13,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

However, prior research has not directly compared processes contributing to age-related variation in prospective memory across the lifespan, hence it is unclear whether the same factors explain the 'rise and fall' of prospective remembering from childhood to later adulthood. The present study examined this question using a paradigm that allowed us to consider the behavioural and neural correlates of processes associated with the prospective and retrospective components of prospective memory. Methods: We compared 14 adolescents, 14 young adults, and 14 old adults in a paradigm where the prospective memory task was embedded in a semantic categorization task. Results: The behavioural data revealed an inverted U-shaped function with adolescents and old adults performing poorly relative to young adults. Analyses of the error data revealed that different processes may have contributed to failures of prospective memory in adolescents and older adults. This finding was supported by age differences in ERP-components for cue detection and post-retrieval processes. Additionally, source localization using LORETA revealed different patterns of neural recruitment for adolescents and older adults relative to younger adults. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that adolescents and older adults show different patterns of behavioural errors and neural recruitment for successful prospective remembering indicating that different processes may contribute to the 'rise and fall' of prospective memory across the lifespan. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Zonfrillo, M.R.; Kim, K.H.; Arbogast, K.B.",2015,databases,Emergency Department Visits and Head Computed Tomography Utilization for Concussion Patients from 2006 to 2011,Academic Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.12696,"Objectives Concussion is the most common type of mild traumatic brain injury for which patients present to the emergency department (ED). It is critical to understand the contemporary epidemiology of concussion and rates of head computed tomography (CT) use in head-injured patients to inform education of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines to emergency medicine providers. Methods This was a cross-sectional analysis of the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) for years 2006 to 2011, representing a stratified probability sample of all U.S. hospital-based EDs. Patients of all ages with concussion diagnoses were included, and those with intracranial hemorrhages or prolonged loss of consciousness were excluded. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were summarized for patient demographics, injury mechanism, Injury Severity Scores (ISS), and concussion incidence rates, based on U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. Results There were 756,214,762 (weighted) ED visits in the NEDS between 2006 and 2011, of which 0.5% received diagnoses of concussion. The national incidence rate of concussion visits increased 22.6% from 195 visits per 100,000 person-years in 2006 to 239 visits per 100,000 person-years in 2011. The incidence of concussion visits increased by 28.1% from 2006 to 2011 overall (580,573 to 743,994) and within all age group categories. The rate of head CT use in patients diagnosed with concussion increased 35.7% (range = 34.5% to 46.8%) for the entire group from 2006 to 2011 (p < 0.0001). The injury severity of patients' injuries decreased over time (66.4% ISS < 5 in 2006 and 75% in 2011; p < 0.0001), while the proportion of discharged patients increased over time (78.1% in 2006 and 86.6% in 2011; p < 0.0001). Conclusions ED visits for concussions have increased over time, with a corresponding increase in head CT utilization despite a decrease in injury severity. Increased visits may be due to more concussion awareness and recognition of subtle injuries. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for neuroimaging in head-injured patients and management of concussion should be reinforced to emergency medicine providers. © 2015 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,exclude,32.2,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of children enrolled in phase I/II clinical trials through the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium from August 2000 to June 2010. PET variables were summarized within diagnostic categories using descriptive statistics. Associations of PET with MR imaging variables and PFS and OS by tumor types were evaluated. Results: Baseline 18F-FDG PET was available in 203 children; 66 had newly diagnosed brain tumors, and 137 had recurrent/refractory brain tumors before enrolling in a Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium trial. MR imaging was performed within 2 wk of PET and before therapy in all cases. The 18F-FDG uptake pattern and MR imaging contrast enhancement (CE) varied by tumor type. On average, glioblastoma multiforme and medulloblastoma had uniform, intense uptake throughout the tumor, whereas brain stem gliomas (BSGs) had low uptake in less than 50% of the tumor and ependymoma had low uptake throughout the tumor. For newly diagnosed BSG, correlation of 18F-FDG uptake with CE portended reduced OS (P 5 0.032); in refractory/recurrent BSG, lack of correlation between 18F-FDG uptake and CE suggested decreased PFS (P 5 0.023). In newly diagnosed BSG for which more than 50% of the tumor had 18F-FDG uptake, there was a suggestion of lower apparent diffusion coefficient (P 5 0.061) and decreased PFS (P 5 0.065). Conclusion: 18F-FDG PET and MR imaging showed a spectrum of patterns depending on tumor type. In newly diagnosed BSG, the correlation of 18F-FDG uptake and CE suggested decreased OS, likely related to more aggressive disease. When more than 50% of the tumor had 18F-FDG uptake, the apparent diffusion coefficient was lower, consistent with increased cellularity. In refractory/recurrent BSG, poor correlation between 18F-FDG uptake and CE was associated with decreased PFS, which may reflect concurrent tissue breakdown at sites of treated disease and development of new sites of 18F-FDG-avid malignancy.
