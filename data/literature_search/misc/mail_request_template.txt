SUBJECT: fMRI coordinates for meta-analysis

Dear Dr/Prof XYZ,

We are currently conducting a meta-analysis of fMRI studies on semantic knowledge in children. Our literature search revealed that one of your highly interesting studies meets our inclusion criteria:

* APA citation of the paper goes here.

To be able to include and cite this work in our analysis, we would need the following additional information (if available):

* Whole-brain, within-group coordinates for the XYZ group in the XYZ task, i.e. a table of the x-, y-, and z-coordinates for all peaks of activation (for conditions X vs. Y) in standard space (Talairach or MNI) and, if possible, their respective t- or z-values.

Could you please send us this information within the next 2 weeks (until 28 Sep 2020)? 

Thank you very much for your effort to support replicable developmental cognitive neuroscience. Please do not hesitate to contact us in case you have any questions.

All the best,
Alexander Enge & Michael A. Skeide
