AB  - A primary challenge facing the development of interventions for dyslexia is identifying effective predictors of intervention response. While behavioral literature has identified core cognitive characteristics of response, the distinction of reading versus executive cognitive contributions to response profiles remains unclear, due in part to the difficulty of segregating these constructs using behavioral outputs. In the current study we used functional neuroimaging to piece apart the mechanisms of how/whether executive and reading network relationships are predictive of intervention response. We found that readers who are responsive to intervention have more typical pre-intervention functional interactions between executive and reading systems compared to nonresponsive readers. These findings suggest that intervention response in dyslexia is influenced not only by domain-specific reading regions, but also by contributions from intervening domain-general networks. Our results make a significant gain in identifying predictive bio-markers of outcomes in dyslexia, and have important implications for the development of personalized clinical interventions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Angiocentric glioma (AG) is a newly-classified, very rare, WHO grade I central nervous system (CNS) lesion, occurring usually in children and young adults. Only 52 patients with AG have been reported so far, making it one of the rarest neuropathological entities. Hereby we present two new cases of AG in young subjects with detailed neuropathological investigations and a neuroradiological picture along with a brief summary of all already published literature reports of this tumor. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue from both cases revealed similar changes characteristic of AG. The tumors were composed of spindle-like, elongated cells, forming characteristic pseudorosettes around vessels and diffusively infiltrating surrounding tissue, trapping neurons between tumor cells. Noticeably, some neoplastic cells encrusting vessels extended far beyond the main tumor mass. Hypothetically, this may be responsible for the recurrence of the tumor even in the case of apparently total excision. In immunohistochemistry, AG cells were glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin positive, also exhibiting a strikingly significant epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) dot-like staining pattern. In one of the cases, electron microscopy revealed ependymal differentiation features such as microvilli and cilia. Taken together, all these data strongly confirm a dual astroglial-ependymal nature of the tumor. Follow up corroborates benign character of this neoplasm. Both AGs reported here were immunonegative for the product of the mutated IDH-1 gene what, according to our best knowledge, has never been reported so far. It may suggest that in their pathogenesis AGs differ from grade II astrocytomas, which in most cases harbor a mutation of IDH-1. Noteworthy, neuroimaging in our cases was relatively characteristic but not conclusive, therefore biopsy (at least) is mandatory. A newly proposed so called "A-B-C" classification of long-term epilepsy-associated tumors (LEATs) places AG in a category named ANET. The authors shortly review the A-B-C classification of LEATs.

T2  - Epilepsy Research
AB  - Purpose: To characterize very early onset symptomatic epilepsies electroclinically, to identify meaningful factors to delineate epilepsy syndromes under this category, and to test validity of the current syndromic organization of these epilepsies by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). Methods: Subjects were 38 epileptic patients with seizure onset before 3 months of age. We investigated the age of seizure onset, seizure types, myoclonus, EEG features, neuroimaging studies, outcome of seizures and development. We performed multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to reveal associations among these characteristics and to find important characteristics to divide this epilepsy group into subgroups. Results: Very early onset epilepsies were characterized by partial seizures and epileptic spasms, especially occurring in combination as a single ictal event (combined seizures), and poor outcome. Suppression-burst (SB), hypsarrhythmia, EEG asymmetry and structural brain abnormalities were common. MCA demonstrated that presence or absence of SB was the most meaningful factor to separate this group into subgroups. MCA on the subgroup with SB revealed a subset with early-onset spasms, partial seizures with single focus, no myoclonus, SB during wakefulness and sleep, no EEG asynchrony, hypsarrhythmia and combined seizures, and another subset with late-onset spasms, partial seizures with multiple foci, myoclonus, EEG asynchrony, no combined seizures, SB during sleep only, no EEG asymmetry, no structural abnormality and no hypsarrhythmia. These corresponded to Ohtahara syndrome and early myoclonic encephalopathy, respectively. Conclusions: Very early onset symptomatic epilepsies have the electroclinical characteristics distinct from those with later onset. This study supported the current ILAE organization on this epilepsy group from statistic approach. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we present a method for the study of synchronization patterns measured from EEG scalp potentials in psychophysiological experiments. This method is based on various techniques: a time-frequency decomposition using sinusoidal filters which improve phase accuracy for low frequencies, a Bayesian approach for the estimation of significant synchrony changes, and a time-frequency-topography visualization technique which allows for easy exploration and provides detailed insights of a particular experiment. Particularly, we focus on in-phase synchrony using an instantaneous phase-lock measure. We also discuss some of the most common methods in the literature, focusing on their relevance to long-range synchrony analysis; this discussion includes a comparison among various synchrony measures. Finally, we present the analysis of a figure categorization experiment to illustrate our method. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a neurogenetic syndrome associated with a high rate of psychiatric disorders. Previous research has revealed distinctive cognitive deficits, including impaired face processing. However, the neuro-functional substrates underlying these deficits have not been explored. Our aim was to investigate facial and emotional processing in 22q11DS. Methods: During event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, 15 individuals with 22q11DS were compared with age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects on a simple visual categorization task (faces or houses). Each stimulus was presented twice, and faces had either neutral or emotional (fearful) expressions. Results: Abnormal responses to faces were observed in 22q11DS, including a lack of normal face-selectivity in fusiform gyrus. By contrast, responses to houses were comparable across groups, with preserved selectivity in parahippocampal gyrus. Results also revealed a repetition-suppression effect for fearful faces in the right amygdala, which arose in healthy control subjects only, suggesting a lack of amygdala modulation by fear expression in 22q11DS. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate selective anomalies in several brain regions critically implicated in visual and social function in 22q11DS. These findings suggest important new avenues for studying emotional processing and social deficits frequently observed in psychotic patients and establishing their relation to specific phenotypic manifestations in 22q11DS. © 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

TI  - A lifespan perspective on semantic processing of concrete concepts: Does a sensory/motor model have the potential to bridge the gap?
AU  - Antonucci, S.M.

T2  - Cognitive, Affective and Behavioral Neuroscience
AB  - Research regarding semantic knowledge of objects is often conducted independently in children and adults. Review of these bodies of evidence suggests that the two literatures are often complementary. It seems critical to determine what we can learn from a developmental perspective, toward the common goal of understanding semantic organization. Here we focus on the proposal that semantic knowledge about concrete concepts may be built on the foundation of sensory/motor processes. In particular, we focus on a moderate formulation of this viewpoint, the sensory/motor model of semantic representations of objects (e.g., Gainotti 2007; Martin 2007), which has been examined utilizing behavioral, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological evidence. Taken together, behavioral and neuroimaging studies with infants, older children, and adults have suggested that patterns laid down in early childhood remain salient throughout the lifespan and may also predict patterns of deficit that emerge following brain injury. © Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2011.

AB  - BACKGROUND Brain injury guidelines (BIG) were developed to reduce overutilization of neurosurgical consultation (NC) as well as computed tomography (CT) imaging. Currently, BIG have been successfully applied to adult populations, but the value of implementing these guidelines among pediatric patients remains unassessed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the established BIG (BIG-1 category) for managing pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) without NC (no-NC). METHODS We prospectively implemented the BIG-1 category (normal neurologic examination, ICH ≤ 4 mm limited to one location, no skull fracture) to identify pediatric TBI patients (age, ≤ 21 years) that were to be managed no-NC. Propensity score matching was performed to match these no-NC patients to a similar cohort of patients managed with NC before the implementation of BIG in a 1:1 ratio for demographics, severity of injury, and type as well as size of ICH. Our primary outcome measure was need for neurosurgical intervention. RESULTS A total of 405 pediatric TBI patients were enrolled, of which 160 (NC, 80; no-NC, 80) were propensity score matched. The mean age was 9.03 ± 7.47 years, 62.1% (n = 85) were male, the median Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 (13-15), and the median head Abbreviated Injury Scale score was 2 (2-3). A subanalysis based on stratifying patients by age groups showed a decreased in the use of repeat head CT (p = 0.02) in the no-NC group, with no difference in progression (p = 0.34) and the need for neurosurgical intervention (p = 0.9) compared with the NC group. CONCLUSION The BIG can be safely and effectively implemented in pediatric TBI patients. Reducing repeat head CT in pediatric patients has long-term sequelae. Likewise, adhering to the guidelines helps in reducing radiation exposure across all age groups. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic/care management, level III. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Brain activation differences of reading-related processes between dyslexic and normal reading children were localized with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The children performed tasks that varied in visuospatial, orthographic, phonologic, and semantic processing demands. Enhanced activation of the left extrastriate cortex was found during all tasks in the dyslexic group. During orthographic processing, dyslexic children predominantly showed activation in the right prefrontal cortex, as also occurred during the visuo-spatial task. Normal readers also showed activation in the left prefrontal cortex. Dyslexic readers showed less activation of both the temporal and the prefrontal cortex during phonologic processing. The results suggest that dyslexic readers fail to use brain areas that are normally specialized in language processing, but rather use areas that underlie visuospatial processing.

AB  - Attachment anxiety has been associated with a hyperactivating response to threat. A modified emotional Stroop task was used to investigate temporal characteristics of the threat response by assessing response latencies to interpersonally threatening words (immediate interference) and two directly subsequent neutral filler words (delayed interference). Greater immediate and delayed interference to threatening words was observed (n = 125), with higher levels of attachment anxiety associated with immediate interference to threatening cues, and lower levels with delayed interference. Thus, attachment anxiety was related to the speed at which moderate perceived threat disrupted ongoing processes under top-down attentional control. Furthermore, top-down attentional control moderated the extent to which immediate or delayed interference was observed. Among participants who demonstrated relatively stronger top-down attentional control, immediate and delayed interference to threatening cues was minimal, suggesting that results involving emotional Stroop interference were primarily attributable to participants with relatively weaker top-down attentional control. The implications of these findings are considered within the broader context of performance-based and neuroimaging research, with suggestions for future applied research.

TI  - Anomalous gray matter patterns in specific reading comprehension deficit are independent of dyslexia

T2  - Annals of Dyslexia
AB  - Specific reading comprehension deficit (SRCD) affects up to 10 % of all children. SRCD is distinct from dyslexia (DYS) in that individuals with SRCD show poor comprehension despite adequate decoding skills. Despite its prevalence and considerable behavioral research, there is not yet a unified cognitive profile of SRCD. While its neuroanatomical basis is unknown, SRCD could be anomalous in regions subserving their commonly reported cognitive weaknesses in semantic processing or executive function. Here we investigated, for the first time, patterns of gray matter volume difference in SRCD as compared to DYS and typical developing (TD) adolescent readers (N = 41). A linear support vector machine algorithm was applied to whole brain gray matter volumes generated through voxel-based morphometry. As expected, DYS differed significantly from TD in a pattern that included features from left fusiform and supramarginal gyri (DYS vs. TD: 80.0 %, p < 0.01). SRCD was well differentiated not only from TD (92.5 %, p < 0.001) but also from DYS (88.0 %, p < 0.001). Of particular interest were findings of reduced gray matter volume in right frontal areas that were also supported by univariate analysis. These areas are thought to subserve executive processes relevant for reading, such as monitoring and manipulating mental representations. Thus, preliminary analyses suggest that SRCD readers possess a distinct neural profile compared to both TD and DYS readers and that these differences might be linked to domain-general abilities. This work provides a foundation for further investigation into variants of reading disability beyond DYS. © 2015, The International Dyslexia Association.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is the most common learning disability in school-aged children with an estimated incidence of five to ten percent. The cause and pathophysiological substrate of this developmental disorder is unclear. Recently, a possible involvement of the cerebellum in the pathogenesis of dyslexia has been postulated. In this study, 15 dyslexic children and 7 age-matched control subjects were investigated by means of functional neuroimaging (fMRI) using a noun-verb association paradigm. Comparison of activation patterns between dyslexic and control subjects revealed distinct and significant differences in cerebral and cerebellar activation. Control subjects showed bilaterally well-defined and focal activation patterns in the frontal and parietal lobes and the posterior regions of the cerebellar hemispheres. The dyslexic children, however, presented widespread and diffuse activations on the cerebral and cerebellar level. Cerebral activations were found in frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital regions. Activations in the cerebellum were found predominantly in the cerebellar cortex, including Crus I, Crus II, hemispheric lobule VI, VII and vermal lobules I, II, III, IV and VII. This preliminary study is the first to reveal a significant difference in cerebellar functioning between dyslexic children and controls during a semantic association task. As a result, we propose a new hypothesis regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms of developmental dyslexia. Given the sites of activation in the cerebellum in the dyslexic group, a defect of the intra-cerebellar distribution of activity is suspected, suggesting a disorder of the processing or transfer of information within the cerebellar cortex. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

T2  - NeuroImage
AB  - We used blood oxygen-dependent (BOLD) fMRI technique at 1.5 T to examine brain regions associated with language comprehension in normally developing children, age 5 to 10 years. Twenty-three children participated in the study using an auditory semantic decision task which varied in task difficulty. Analysis of individual participants' data showed patterns of activation largely consistent with previous neuroimaging findings in adult language processing. Group data analysis also showed a strong left-lateralized pattern of activation that closely resembles those typically observed in adults. In addition, significant activation in the left fusiform gyrus was observed and was associated with task accuracy. This finding suggests that auditory semantic processing in young children may recruit cortical regions associated with word reading in adults prior to the initiation of a semantic category decision, a process which is consistent with patterns of early word recognition process and language development. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background. The mind's ability to think about the mind has attracted substantial research interest in cognitive science in recent decades, as 'theory of mind'. No research has attempted to identify the brain basis of this ability, probably because it involves several separate processes. As a first step, we investigated one component process - the ability to recognise mental state terms. Method. In Experiment 1, we tested a group of children with autism (known to have theory of mind deficits) and a control group of children with mental handicap, for their ability to recognise mental state terms in a word list. This was to test if the mental state recognition task was related to traditional theory of mind tests. In Experiment 2, we investigated if in the normal brain, recognition of mental state terms might be localised. The procedure employed single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) in normal adult volunteers. We tested the prediction (based on available neurological and animal lesion studies) that there would be increased activation in the orbito-frontal cortex during this task, relative to a control condition, and relative to an adjacent frontal area (frontal-polar cortex). Results. In Experiment 1, the group with autism performed significantly worse than the group without autism. In Experiment 2, there was increased cerebral blood flow during the mental state recognition task in the right orbito-frontal cortex relative to the left frontal-polar region. Conclusions. This simple mental state recognition task appears to relate to theory of mind, in that both are impaired in autism. The SPECT results implicate the orbito-frontal cortex as the basis of this ability.

AB  - Introduction: The relationship between language abilities and language lateralization in the developing brain is important for our understanding of the neural architecture of language development. Methods: We investigated 35 right-handed children and adolescents aged 7–16 years with a functional magnetic resonance imaging language paradigm and a comprehensive language and verbal memory examination. Results: We found that less lateralized language was significantly correlated with better language performance across areas of the brain and across different language tasks. Less lateralized language in the overall brain was associated with better in-scanner task accuracy on a semantic language decision task and out-of-scanner vocabulary and verbal fluency. Specifically, less lateralized frontal lobe language dominance was associated with better in-scanner task accuracy and out-of-scanner verbal fluency. Furthermore, less lateralized parietal language was associated with better out-of-scanner verbal memory across learning, short- and long-delay trials. In contrast, we did not find any relationship between temporal lobe language laterality and verbal performance. Conclusions: This study suggests that semantic language performance is better with some involvement of the nondominant hemisphere. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Objective Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often present with deficits in episodic memory, and there is evidence that these difficulties may be secondary to executive dysfunction, that is, impaired selection and/or application of memory-encoding strategies (mediation hypothesis). Semantic clustering is an effective strategy to enhance encoding of verbal episodic memory (VEM) when word lists are semantically related. Self-initiated mobilization of this strategy has been associated with increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex, a key region in the pathophysiology of OCD. We therefore studied children and adolescents with OCD during uncued semantic clustering strategy application in a VEM functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-encoding paradigm. Method A total of 25 pediatric patients with OCD (aged 8.1-17.5 years) and 25 healthy controls (HC, aged 8.1-16.9) matched for age, gender, handedness, and IQ were evaluated using a block design VEM paradigm that manipulated semantically related and unrelated words. Results The semantic clustering strategy score (SCS) predicted VEM performance in HC (p &lt;.001, R2 = 0.635), but not in patients (p =.099). Children with OCD also presented hypoactivation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (cluster-corrected p &lt;.001). Within-group analysis revealed a negative correlation between Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and activation of orbitofrontal cortex in the group with OCD. Finally, a positive correlation between age and SCS was found in HC (p =.001, r = 0.635), but not in patients with OCD (p =.936, r = 0.017). Conclusion Children with OCD presented altered brain activation during the VEM paradigm and absence of expected correlation between SCS and age, and between SCS and total words recalled. These results suggest that different neural mechanisms underlie self-initiated semantic clustering in OCD. © 2015 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

AB  - Autobiographical memory (AM) is a critically important form of memory for life events that undergoes substantial developmental changes from childhood to adulthood. Relatively little is known regarding the functional neural correlates of AM retrieval in children as assessed with fMRI, and how they may differ from adults. We investigated this question with 14 children ages 8–11 years and 14 adults ages 19–30 years, contrasting AM retrieval with semantic memory (SM) retrieval. During scanning, participants were cued by verbal prompts to retrieve previously selected recent AMs or to verify semantic properties of words. As predicted, both groups showed AM retrieval-related increased activation in regions implicated in prior studies, including bilateral hippocampus, and prefrontal, posterior cingulate, and parietal cortices. Adults showed greater activation in the hippocampal/parahippocampal region as well as prefrontal and parietal cortex, relative to children; age-related differences were most prominent in the first 8 sec versus the second 8 sec of AM retrieval and when AM retrieval was contrasted with semantic retrieval. This study is the first to characterise similarities and differences during AM retrieval in children and adults using fMRI. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Importance: Pediatric disorders characterized by behavioral and emotional dysregulation pose diagnostic and treatment challenges because of high comorbidity, suggesting that theymay be better conceptualized dimensionally rather than categorically. Identifying neuroimaging measures associated with behavioral and emotional dysregulation in youth may inform understanding of underlying dimensional vs disorder-specific pathophysiologic features. Objective: To identify, in a large cohort of behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth, neuroimaging measures that (1) are associated with behavioral and emotional dysregulation pathologic dimensions (behavioral and emotional dysregulation measured with the Parent General Behavior Inventory 10-Item Mania Scale [PGBI-10M], mania, depression, and anxiety) or (2) differentiate diagnostic categories (bipolar spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders). Design, setting, and participants: A multisite neuroimaging studywas conducted from February 1, 2011, to April 15, 2012, at 3 academic medical centers: University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Participants included a referred sample of behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study (n = 85) and healthy youth (n = 20). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Region-of-interest analyses examined relationships among prefrontal-ventral striatal reward circuitry during a reward paradigm (win, loss, and control conditions), symptom dimensions, and diagnostic categories. Results: Regardless of diagnosis, higher PGBI-10M scores were associated with greater left middle prefrontal cortical activity (r = 0.28) and anxiety with greater right dorsal anterior cingulate cortical (r = 0.27) activity to win. The 20 highest (t = 2.75) and 20 lowest (t = 2.42) PGBI-10M-scoring youth showed significantly greater left middle prefrontal cortical activity to win compared with 20 healthy youth. Disruptive behavior disorders were associated with lower left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity to win (t = 2.68) (all P < .05, corrected). Conclusions and relevance: Greater PGBI-10M-related left middle prefrontal cortical activity and anxiety-related right dorsal anterior cingulate cortical activity to win may reflect heightened reward sensitivity and greater attention to reward in behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth regardless of diagnosis. Reduced left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity to win may reflect reward insensitivity in youth with disruptive behavior disorders. Despite a distinct reward-related neurophysiologic feature in disruptive behavior disorders, findings generally support a dimensional approach to studying neural mechanisms in behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth. © 2014 American Medical Association.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with palatal clefts are predisposed to developing speech and language abnormalities. Emerging evidence indicates that children with cleft lip and/or cleft palate have higher rates of learning disabilities than the general population and differences in brain morphology. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging of 12 individuals with isolated unilateral complete clefts of the lip and palate produced functional images during three lexical processing tasks: generation of verbs, opposites, and rhymes. Direct statistical comparisons were made between subjects with cleft lip and palate and controls (matched for age and performance) from an extant data set, both as a group and individually. RESULTS: Two types of differences were found. Compared with unaffected controls, subjects with clefts showed a delayed and elongated blood oxygen level-dependent response in regions found throughout the cerebrum, including in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, right precuneus, and right temporal gyrus. A right middle frontal gyrus region was activated by these tasks in controls but not in subjects with clefts. Developmental analysis showed that subjects 14.5 years and older (n = 5) had a larger number of age-related regions differing in blood oxygen level-dependent response from controls than did younger subjects (n = 7). Single-patient analysis demonstrated substantial individual variability. CONCLUSIONS: Children with cleft lip and palate, performing lexical processing tasks at a comparable level of proficiency, use a similar but nonidentical functional neuroanatomy than peers without clefts. Differing neural circuitry for language tasks and differing developmental trajectories could help explain the predisposition to velopharyngeal dysfunction and learning disabilities in this population.

AB  - Contemporary studies of long-term outcomes in children supported on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the United States are limited. We enrolled 99 ECMO patients between July 2010 and June 2015 in a two-center prospective observational study that included neurologic and neuropsychologic evaluation at 6 and 12 months, using standardized outcome measures. Pre-ECMO, 20 (20%) had a pre-existing neurologic diagnosis, 40 (40%) had cardiac arrest, and 10 of 47 (21%) children with neuroimaging had acute abnormal findings. Of 50 children eligible for follow-up at 6 or 12 months, 40 (80%) returned for at least one visit. At the follow-up visit of longest interval from ECMO, the median Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II) score was 91 (interquartile range [IQR], 81-98), the median Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) score was 1 (IQR, 0-2), and the median Mullen Scales of Early Learning composite score was 85 (IQR, 72-96). Presence of new neuroimaging abnormalities during ECMO or within 6 weeks post-ECMO was associated with VABS-II score <85 or death within 12 months after ECMO. The Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category at hospital discharge showed a strong relationship with unfavorable VABS-II and PSOM scores at 6 or 12 months after ECMO. In this study, we report a higher prevalence of pre-ECMO neurologic conditions than previously described. In survivors to hospital discharge, median scores for adaptive behavior and cognitive, neurologic, and quality of life assessments were all below the general population means, but most deficits would be considered minor within each of the domains tested.

AB  - Objective: To determine if elevations in plasma brain injury biomarkers are associated with outcome at hospital discharge in children who require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Single tertiary-care academic center. Participants: Eighty children who underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between June 2010 and December 2013. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We measured six brain injury biomarkers (glial fibrillary acidic protein, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1/chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, neuron-specific enolase, S100b, intercellular adhesion molecule-5, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor) daily during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, using an electrochemiluminescent multiplex assay. We recorded clinical, neuroimaging, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation course data. We analyzed the association of biomarker concentrations with favorable versus unfavorable outcome at hospital discharge. Favorable outcome was defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category 1, 2, or no change from baseline. Patients had a median age of 3 days (interquartile range, 1 d-10 mo), and 56% were male. Thirty-three of 80 (41%) had unfavorable outcome, and 22 of 70 (31%) had abnormal neuroimaging findings during or after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Peak concentrations were significantly higher in patients with unfavorable outcome than in those with favorable outcome for glial fibrillary acidic protein (p = 0.002), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1/chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (p = 0.030), neuron-specific enolase (p = 0.006), and S100b (p = 0.015) and in patients with versus without abnormal neuroimaging findings for glial fibrillary acidic protein (p = 0.001) and intercellular adhesion molecule-5 (p = 0.001). The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for unfavorable outcome was 0.73 for a noncollinear biomarker combination. After removing collinear biomarkers, the adjusted odds ratios for unfavorable outcome were 2.89 (95% CI, 1.09-7.73) for neuron-specific enolase, using a cutoff of 62.0 ng/mL, and 2.15 (95% CI, 1.06-4.38) for glial fibrillary acidic protein, using a cutoff of 0.46 ng/mL. Conclusions: Elevated plasma brain injury biomarker concentrations during the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation course are associated with unfavorable outcome and/or the presence of neuroimaging abnormalities. Combinations of brain-specific proteins increase the sensitivity and specificity for outcome prediction. Copyright © 2015 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Syntax allows human beings to build an infinite number of new sentences from a finite stock of words. Because toddlers typically utter only one or two words at a time, they have been thought to have no syntax. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we demonstrated that 2-year-olds do compute syntactic structure when listening to spoken sentences. We observed an early left-lateralized brain response when an expected verb was incorrectly replaced by a noun (or vice versa). Thus, toddlers build on-line expectations as to the syntactic category of the next word in a sentence. In addition, the response topography was different for nouns and verbs, suggesting that different neural networks already underlie noun and verb processing in toddlers, as they do in adults. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The respective roles of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures in memory are controversial. Some authors put forward a modular account according to which episodic memory and recollection-based processes are crucially dependent on the hippocampal formation whereas semantic acquisition and familiarity-based processes rely on the adjacent parahippocampal gyri. Others defend a unitary view.We report the case of VJ, a boy with developmental amnesia of most likely perinatal onset diagnosed at the age of 8. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including quantitative volumetric measurements of the hippocampal formation and of the entorhinal, perirhinal, and temporopolar cortices, showed severe, bilateral atrophy of the hippocampal formation, fornix and mammillary bodies; by contrast, the perirhinal cortex was within normal range and the entorhinal and temporopolar cortex remained within two standard deviations (SDs) from controls' mean. We examined the development of his semantic knowledge from childhood to teenage as well as his recognition and cued recall memory abilities. On tasks tapping semantic memory, VJ increased his raw scores across years at the same rate as children from large standardisation samples, except for one task; he achieved average performance, consistent with his socio-educational background. He performed within normal range on 74% of recognition tests and achieved average to above average scores on 42% of them despite very severe impairment on 82% of episodic recall tasks. Both faces and landscapes-scenes gave rise to above average scores when tested with coloured stimuli. Cued recall, although impaired, was largely superior to free recall.This case supports a modular account of the MTL with episodic, but not semantic memory depending on the hippocampal formation. Furthermore, the overall pattern of findings is consistent with evidence from both brain-damaged and neuroimaging studies indicating that recollection requires intact hippocampal formation and familiarity relies, at least partly, on the adjacent temporal lobe cortex. © 2011 Elsevier Srl.

AB  - Background: Opponent-process theories of externalizing disorders (ExD) attribute them to some combination of overactive reward processing systems and/or underactive behavior inhibition systems. Reward processing has been indexed by recruitment of incentive-motivational neurocircuitry of the ventral striatum (VS), including nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an incentive task to determine whether externalizing symptomatology in adolescence is correlated with an enhanced VS recruitment by cues for rewards, or by deliveries of rewards. Twelve community-recruited adolescents with externalizing disorders (AED) and 12 age/gender-matched controls responded to targets to win or avoid losing $0, $0.20, $1, $5, or an unknown amount (ranging from $0.20 to $5). Results: Cues to respond for rewards activated the NAcc (relative to cues for no incentive), in both subject groups similarly, with greatest NAcc recruitment by cues for the largest reward. Loss-anticipatory NAcc signal increase was detected in a volume-of-interest analysis - but this increase occurred only in trials when subjects hit the target. Relative to controls, AED showed significantly elevated NAcc activation by a linear contrast between reward notification versus notification of failure to win reward. In a post hoc reanalysis, VS and pregenual anterior cingulate activation by the reward versus non-reward outcome contrast also directly correlated with Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Externalizing total scores (across all subjects) in lieu of a binary diagnosis. Finally, both groups showed right insula activation by loss notifications (contrasted with avoided losses). Conclusions: Externalizing behavior, whether assessed dimensionally with a questionnaire, or in the form of a diagnostic categorization, is associated with an exaggerated limbic response to outcomes of reward-directed behavior. This could be a neurobiological signature of the behavioral sensitivity to laboratory reward delivery that is characteristic of children with externalizing symptomatology. Of interest is future research on incentive-motivational processing in more severe, clinically referred AED. © 2009 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

T2  - Brain and Language
AB  - This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain-behavior correlations in a group of 16 children (9- to 12-year-olds). Activation was measured during a semantic judgment task presented in either the visual or auditory modality that required the individual to determine whether a final word was related in meaning to one of two previous words (e.g., found-tank-lost). The main finding was that higher performers (i.e., accuracy) were associated with more activation in posterior representational systems including the inferior and middle temporal gyri, whereas lower performers were associated with more activation in anterior regions including the inferior and middle frontal gyri. This pattern of results was interpreted as reflecting an elaborated semantic representational system in temporal areas for the high accuracy performers that allowed them to efficiently and accurately make meaning based judgments. The low accuracy performers may have an inaccurate or weakly interconnected semantic system that results in greater use of frontal areas in a feature selection process. © 2005.

T2  - Neuropsychologia
AB  - Neuroimaging studies have suggested that left inferior frontal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule and left middle temporal gyrus are critical for semantic processing in normal children. The goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to determine whether these regions are systematically related to semantic processing in children (9- to 15-year-old) diagnosed with reading disorders (RD). Semantic judgments required participants to indicate whether two words were related in meaning. The strength of semantic association varied continuously from higher association pairs (e.g., king-queen) to lower association pairs (e.g. net-ship). We found that the correlation between association strength and activation was significantly weaker for RD children compared to controls in left middle temporal gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule for both the auditory and the visual modalities and in left inferior frontal gyrus for the visual modality. These results suggest that the RD children have abnormalities in semantic search/retrieval in the inferior frontal gyrus, integration of semantic information in the inferior parietal lobule and semantic lexical representations in the middle temporal gyrus. These deficits appear to be general to the semantic system and independent of modality. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - On the development of color naming in young children: Data and theory
AU  - Bornstein, M.H.
T2  - Brain and Language
AB  - Among the semantics of different common attributes of the environment, consistent and correct color naming seems to develop paradoxically late in children, for even young infants discriminate and categorize colors well, color is a salient feature of the child's world, and children are aware of color as a separate domain, know color terms, and respond to color questions with color names. Several specific anomalies characterize early linguistic development in this domain: Errors in beginning color naming are perseverative or random, there seems to be a minimum age for correct and consistent color naming, developmental rate shows wide individual differences, and acquisition among girls is generally faster than among boys. This essay reviews data that support these observations, and evaluates three traditional explanations for them-including the perceptual salience of color for children, experience and learning in the child, and cognitive development-against a fourth new possibility. It is hypothesized that appropriate color naming may depend on the maturation and integration of specific cortical neurological structures; among several interpretations, the neurological one accounts best for diverse characteristics of early color naming. © 1985.

TI  - Clinical factors associated with invasive testing and imaging in patients with complex febrile seizures
AU  - Boyle, D.A.
AU  - Sturm, J.J.
T2  - Pediatric Emergency Care
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complex febrile seizures (CFSs) are a common diagnosis in the pediatric emergency department (PED). Although multiple studies have shown a low likelihood of intracranial infections and abnormal neuroimaging findings among those who present with CFS, the absence of a consensus recommendation and the diversity of CFS presentations (ie, multiple seizures, prolonged seizure, focal seizure) often drive physicians to do a more extensive workup than needed. Few studies examine the factors that influence providers to pursue invasive testing and emergent neuroimaging. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the clinical factors associated with a more extensive workup in a cohort of patients who present to the PED with CFSs. METHODS: Patient visits to a tertiary care PED with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis of CFS were reviewed from April 2009 to November 2011. Patients included were 6 months to 6 years of age. Complex febrile seizures were defined as febrile seizures lasting 15 minutes or longer, more than 1 seizure in 24 hours, and/or a focal seizure. Charts were reviewed for demographics, clinical parameters (duration of fever, history of febrile seizure, focality of seizure, antibiotic use before PED, and immunization status), PED management (antiepileptic drugs given in the PED or by Emergency Medical Services, empiric antibiotics given in the PED, laboratory testing, lumbar puncture, or computed tomography [CT] scan), and results (cultures, laboratories, or imaging). A logistic regression model was created to determine which clinical parameters were associated with diagnostic testing. RESULTS: One hundred ninety patients were diagnosed with CFS and met study criteria. Clinical management in the PED included a lumbar puncture in 37%, blood cultures in 88%, urine cultures in 47%, and a head CT scan in 28%. There were no positive cerebral spinal fluid or blood cultures in this cohort. Of the 90 patients, 4 (4.4%) with urine cultures had a urinary tract infection. Of the 53 patients who had head CT imaging, there were no significant findings that guided therapy. The only factor associated with having a lumbar puncture performed was whether empiric antibiotics were used (odds ratio [OR], 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-6.8). History of a febrile seizure was associated with lower odds of a lumbar puncture (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69). In addition, higher age category was also associated with lower odds of a lumbar puncture (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31-0.91). Those who received an antiepileptic drug had a higher odds of getting a head CT (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5-8.6). Furthermore, patients presenting with a focal seizure also had higher odds of getting a head CT (OR, 4.89; 95% CI, 1.41-16.9). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low utility of associated findings, there are important clinical parameters that are associated with obtaining a lumbar puncture or a head CT as part of the diagnostic workup. National practice parameters to guide evaluation for CFSs in the acute setting are warranted to reduce the amount of invasive testing and imaging.© Copyright 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

TI  - Functional neural networks of semantic and syntactic processes in the developing brain
AU  - Brauer, J.
AU  - Friederici, A.D.
T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - The functional neuroanatomy of language in the adult brain separates semantic and syntactic processes in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and in the inferior frontal cortex. It is unknown whether a similar specialization is present in the developing brain. Semantic and syntactic aspects of sentence processing were investigated in 5- to 6-year-old children and in adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although adults demonstrated function-specific activations in the STG and the frontal operculum, children showed a large activation overlap for these two language aspects in the STG. Compared to adults, they engaged additional areas in the left and right inferior frontal gyrus, which are known to support resource demanding processes. Thus, the language networks for semantic and syntactic processes are not yet specialized similarly to adults in the developing brain. © 2007 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Purpose: Atypical language organization is more frequently found in patients with refractory partial epilepsy than in healthy controls; however, the reasons for this are not well known. Here we assess the relation between language laterality index (LI) and white-matter tract changes. Methods: Nine patients with refractory partial epilepsy were assessed with a 3-T GE scanner. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of language and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were acquired, For the fMRI, a noun-verb generation task was performed, all images were motion corrected, and activated pixels in classic language areas were counted. The DTI images were acquired in six standard directions with an initial non-diffusion-weighted scan. The "average anisotropy" was determined in a region of interest in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and parietal lobe white matter. An asymmetry index (AI) was calculated for language and DTI. Atypical language lateralization was diagnosed if the lateralization index (Ll)-language was smaller than 0.4. Results: Two of the nine patients had atypical language localization (LI-language, -0,6, and 0.3): both had left temporal DTI asymmetry (LI-DTI, -0,3 and -0.2). The remaining seven patients had typical language localization, and no marked DTI abnormalities. Asymmetry in temporal lobe DTI correlated with LI-language (r = 0.8; p = 0.006). Conclusions: Atypical language lateralization in patients with partial epilepsy may be associated with white-matter tract abnormalities.

AB  - Objective: Our recent electrocorticography (ECoG) study suggested reverse speech, a widely used control task, to be a poor control for non-language-related auditory activity. We hypothesized that this may be due to retained perception as a human voice. We report a follow-up ECoG study in which we contrast forward and reverse speech with a signal-correlated noise (SCN) control task that cannot be perceived as a human voice. Methods: Ten patients were presented 90 audible stimuli, including 30 each of corresponding forward speech, reverse speech, and SCN trials, during ECoG recording with evaluation of gamma activity between 50 and 150. Hz. Results: Sites of the lateral temporal gyri activated throughout speech stimuli were generally less activated by SCN, while some temporal sites seemed to process both human and non-human sounds. Reverse speech trials were associated with activities across the temporal lobe similar to those associated with forward speech. Conclusions: Findings herein externally validate functional neuroimaging studies utilizing SCN as a control for non-language-specific auditory function. Our findings are consistent with the notion that stimuli perceived as originating from a human voice are poor controls for non-language auditory function. Significance: Our findings have implications in functional neuroimaging research as well as improved clinical mapping of auditory functions. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - The present study examined cortical auditory evoked related potentials (AERPs) for the P1-N250 and MMN components in children 9. years of age. The first goal was to investigate whether AERPs respond differentially to vowels and complex tones, and the second goal was to explore how prototypical language formant structures might be reflected in these early auditory processing stages. Stimuli were two synthetic within-category vowels (/y/), one of which was preferred by adult German listeners ("prototypical-vowel"), and analogous complex tones. P1 strongly distinguished vowels from tones, revealing larger amplitudes for the more difficult to discriminate but phonetically richer vowel stimuli. Prototypical language phoneme status did not reliably affect AERPs; however P1 amplitudes elicited by the prototypical-vowel correlated robustly with the ability to correctly identify two prototypical-vowels presented in succession as "same" (r = -0.70) and word reading fluency (r = -0.63). These negative correlations suggest that smaller P1 amplitudes elicited by the prototypical-vowel predict enhanced accuracy when judging prototypical-vowel "sameness" and increased word reading speed. N250 and MMN did not differentiate between vowels and tones and showed no correlations to behavioural measures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To comprehend language, listeners need to encode the relationship between words within sentences. This entails categorizing words into their appropriate word classes. Function words, consistently preceding words from specific categories (e.g., the ballNOUN, I speakVERB), provide invaluable information for this task, and children's sensitivity to such adjacent relationships develops early on in life. However, neighboring words are not the sole source of information regarding an item's word class. Here we examine whether young children also take into account preceding sentence context online during syntactic categorization. To address this question, we use the ambiguous French function word la which, depending on sentence context, can either be used as determiner (the, preceding nouns) or as object clitic (it, preceding verbs). French-learning 18-month-olds’ evoked potentials (ERPs) were recorded while they listened to sentences featuring this ambiguous function word followed by either a noun or a verb (thus yielding a locally felicitous co-occurrence of la + noun or la + verb). Crucially, preceding sentence context rendered the sentence either grammatical or ungrammatical. Ungrammatical sentences elicited a late positivity (resembling a P600) that was not observed for grammatical sentences. Toddlers’ analysis of the unfolding sentence was thus not limited to local co-occurrences, but rather took into account non-adjacent sentence context. These findings suggest that by 18 months of age, online word categorization is already surprisingly robust. This could be greatly beneficial for the acquisition of novel words. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Syntax allows human beings to build an infinite number of sentences from a finite number of words. How this unique, productive power of human language unfolds over the course of language development is still hotly debated. When they listen to sentences comprising newly-learned words, do children generalize from their knowledge of the legal combinations of word categories or do they instead rely on strings of words stored in memory to detect syntactic errors? Using novel words taught in the lab, we recorded Evoked Response Potentials (ERPs) in two-year-olds and adults listening to grammatical and ungrammatical sentences containing syntactic contexts that had not been used during training. In toddlers, the ungrammatical use of words, even when they have been just learned, induced an early left anterior negativity (surfacing 100-400 ms after target word onset) followed by a late posterior positivity (surfacing 700-900 ms after target word onset) that was not observed in grammatical sentences. This late effect was remarkably similar to the P600 displayed by adults, suggesting that toddlers and adults perform similar syntactic computations. Our results thus show that toddlers build on-line expectations regarding the syntactic category of upcoming words in a sentence. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Seventy‐three patients under 18 years of age with a recurrent central nervous system tumor were randomized to receive combination chemotherapy with MOPP or OPP. Patients were stratified according to the tumor type into four major disease‐categories: (1) medulloblastoma, (2) astrocytoma and other glioma, (3) ependymoma, and (4) miscellaneous tumors to provide equal distribution of patients for each treatment within each disease category. Evaluation of response was based on computerized brain scan findings. Thirty‐five patients received MOPP and 38 received OPP treatment. There were three complete and six partial remissions among patients receiving MOPP and one complete and five partial remissions among patients receiving OPP. In addition, six patients on MOPP had stable disease for seven to 21 months. Only two patients on OPP had stable disease(6 and 36 months). Most of responses in both treatment regimens occurred in patients with medullo‐blastoma and astrocytoma. Median duration of remission was ninemonths for the MOPP and 11 months for the OPP. Two patients on MOPP regimen had fatal myelosuppression. Although the more toxic MOPP regimen produced more responses than OPP in children, differences in the duration of response or survival were not statistically significant (P=.79 and P = .84, respectively).

AB  - Regions of human ventral extrastriate visual cortex develop specializations for natural categories (e.g., faces) and cultural artifacts (e.g., words). In adults, category-based specializations manifest as greater neural responses in visual regions of the brain (e.g., fusiform gyrus) to some categories over others. However, few studies have examined how these specializations originate in the brains of children. Moreover, it is as yet unknown whether the development of visual specializations hinges on "increases" in the response to the preferred categories, "decreases" in the responses to nonpreferred categories, or "both." This question is relevant to a long-standing debate concerning whether neural development is driven by building up or pruning back representations. To explore these questions, we measured patterns of visual activity in 4-year-old children for 4 categories (faces, letters, numbers, and shoes) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We report 2 key findings regarding the development of visual categories in the brain: 1) the categories "faces" and "symbols" doubly dissociate in the fusiform gyrus before children can read and 2) the development of category-specific responses in young children depends on cortical responses to nonpreferred categories that decrease as preferred category knowledge is acquired. © The Author 2010.

AB  - Priming effects were examined in 40 children (9-15years old) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An orthographic judgment task required participants to determine if two sequentially presented spoken words had the same spelling for the rime. Four lexical conditions were designed: similar orthography and phonology (O+P+), similar orthography but different phonology (O+P-), similar phonology but different orthography (O-P+), and different orthography and phonology (O-P-). In left superior temporal gyrus, there was lower activation for targets in O+P+ than for those in O-P- and higher accuracy was correlated with stronger activation across all lexical conditions. These results provide evidence for phonological priming in children and greater elaboration of phonological representations in higher skill children, respectively. In left fusiform gyrus, there was lower activation for targets in O+P+ and O+P- than for those in O-P-, suggesting that visual similarity resulted in orthographic priming even with only auditory input. In left middle temporal gyrus, there was lower activation for targets in O+P+ than all other lexical conditions, suggesting that converging orthographic and phonological information resulted in a weaker influence on semantic representations. In addition, higher reading skill was correlated with weaker activation in left middle temporal gyrus across all lexical conditions, suggesting that higher skill children rely to a lesser degree on semantics as a compensatory mechanism. Finally, conflict effects but not priming effects were observed in left inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting that this region is involved in resolving conflicting orthographic and phonological information but not in perceptual priming. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Developmental differences in the neurocognitive networks for phonological and semantic processing in Chinese word reading were examined in 13 adults and 13 children using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Rhyming and semantic association judgments were made to two-character words that were presented sequentially in the visual modality. These lexical tasks were compared with a nonlinguistic control task involving judgment of line patterns. The first main finding was that adults showed greater activation than children in right middle occipital gyrus on both the meaning and rhyming task, suggesting adults more effectively engage right hemisphere brain regions involved in the visual-spatial analysis of Chinese characters. The second main finding was that adults showed greater activation than children in left inferior parietal lobule for the rhyming as compared with the meaning task, suggesting greater specialization of phonological processing in adults. The third main finding was that children who had better performance in the rhyming task on characters with conflicting orthographic and phonological information relative to characters with nonconflicting information showed greater activation in left middle frontal gyrus, suggesting greater engagement of brain regions involved in the integration of orthography and phonology. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Change in subtle N170 specialization in response to Chinese characters and pseudocharacters

T2  - Perceptual and Motor Skills
AB  - The N170 effect is thought to reflect fast perceptual processing for visual words. While quite a few studies on developmental word-related coarse N170 specialization have been reported, little is known about the appearance of the subtle N170 specialization in processing logographic scripts by Chinese children. The present study investigated the changes of subtle N170 specialization for Chinese logographic script in 32 primary schoolchildren in Grades 2 and 6, and in 16 college students. Participants were required to perform a content-irrelevant color-matching task. The results showed that the subtle N170 specialization for Chinese characters had not emerged in Grade 2 children. Interestingly, both Chinese characters and pseudowords elicited larger N170 responses than stroke combinations in Grade 6 children and adults, which suggested that the subtle N170 specialization for Chinese characters associated with reading learning had achieved adult level in children by Grade 6. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2011.

AB  - A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was performed on a 4-year-old girl with autism. While sedated, she listened to three utterances (numbers, hello, her own first name) played through headphones. Based on analyses of the fMRI data, the amount of total brain activation varied with the content of the utterance. The greatest volume of overall activation was in response to numbers, followed by the word 'hello', with the least activation to her name. Frontal cortex activation was greatest in response to her name, with less activation for numbers, and the least for the word 'hello.' These findings indicate that fMRI can identify and quantify the brain regions that are activated in response to words in children with autism under sedation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.

AB  - ObjectiveYouth who experience interpersonal trauma and have posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) develop cognitive deficits that impact their development. Our goal is to investigate the function of the hippocampus in adolescents with PTSS during a memory processing task.MethodsTwenty-seven adolescents between the ages of 10-17 years (16 with PTSS and 11 healthy controls) encoded and retrieved visually presented nouns (Verbal Declarative Memory Task) while undergoing fMRI scanning.ResultsThe PTSS group demonstrated reduced activation of the right hippocampus during the retrieval component of the task. Further, severity of symptoms of avoidance and numbing correlated with reduced left hippocampal activation during retrieval.ConclusionsDecreased activity of the hippocampus during a verbal memory task may be a neurofunctional marker of PTSS in youth with history of interpersonal trauma. The results of this study may facilitate the development of focused treatments and may be of utility when assessing treatment outcome for PTSS. © The Author 2009.

TI  - Diabetes insipidus in children: Pathophysiology, diagnosis and management
AU  - Cheetham, T.
AU  - Baylis, P.H.
T2  - Pediatric Drugs
AB  - In diabetes insipidus, the amount of water ingested and the quantity and concentration of urine produced needs to be carefully regulated if fluid volume and osmolality are to be maintained within the normal range. One of the principal mechanisms controlling urine output is vasopressin which is released from the posterior pituitary gland and enhances water reabsorption from the renal collecting duct. In diabetes insipidus, the excessive production of dilute urine, and the causes of this clinical picture can be divided into three main groups: the first is primary polydipsia where the amount of fluid ingested is inappropriately large; the second group is cranial diabetes insipidus where the production of vasopressin is abnormally low; and, the third group is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus where the kidney response to vasopressin is impaired. The history and examination may suggest an underlying explanation for diabetes insipidus but a range of baseline and more extensive investigations may be required before a diagnosis can be reached. These investigations are not without risk, and the results need to be interpreted carefully because children do not always segregate neatly into a particular diagnostic category on the basis of one test alone. Children with cranial diabetes insipidus typically respond to arginine vasopressin or its manufactured analogue, desmopressin, with an increase in urine osmolality and an associated reduction in urine output. Such children usually require neuroimaging to look for evidence of evolving CNS pathology, such as an intracranial tumour. Vasopressin 'replacement' with desmopressin is the treatment of choice in patients with cranial diabetes insipidus although extreme caution is required when treating babies or small children because of the danger of fluid overload. Abnormal production of other pituitary hormones in children with CNS disease can also influence fluid balance. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be due to abnormal electrolyte concentrations, therefore these should be measured as part of the initial assessment. In a small number of children the defect is a primary abnormality of the vasopressin receptor or one of the water channel proteins (aquaporins) involved in water transport. The treatment of these patients is difficult and typically involves therapy with a diuretic such as chlorothiazide, as well as indomethacin. These agents enhance urine osmolality by their effect on circulating volume and renal solute and water handling. The fluid intake of most young children with primary polydipsia can be safely reduced to a more appropriate level.

TI  - Functional-anatomical organization of predicate metaphor processing
AU  - Chen, E.
AU  - Widick, P.
AU  - Chatterjee, A.
T2  - Brain and Language
AB  - The bulk of the research on the neural organization of metaphor comprehension has focused on nominal metaphors and the metaphoric relationships between word pairs. By contrast, little work has been conducted on predicate metaphors using verbs of motion such as "The man fell under her spell." We examined predicate metaphors as compared to literal sentences of motion such as "The child fell under the slide" in an event-related, functional MRI study. Our results demonstrated greater activation in the left inferior frontal cortex and left lateral temporal lobe for predicate metaphors as compared to literal sentences, while no differences were seen in homologous areas of the right hemisphere. We suggest that the results support a neural organization principle for motion processing in which greater abstraction proceeds along a posterior-to-anterior axis within the lateral portion of the left temporal cortex. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have aberrant neural activity during semantic judgments. We aimed to examine age-dependent neural correlates of semantic processing in boys with ASD as compared to typically developing boys (TD). We used functional MRI to investigate 37 boys with ASD (mean age = 13.3 years, standard deviation = 2.4) and 35 age-, sex-, Intelligence quotient (IQ)- and handedness-matched TD boys (mean age = 13.3 years, standard deviation = 2.7) from age 8 to 18 years. Participants had to indicate whether pairs of Chinese characters presented visually were related in meaning. Group (ASD, TD) × Age (Old, Young) ANOVA was used to examine the difference of age-related changes. Direct comparisons between the adolescent group and the child group were also performed. The behavioral results showed that the ASD group had lower accuracy in the related condition relative to the TD group. The neuroimaging results showed greater activation in the cuneus and less activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in boys with ASD than TD boys. Children with ASD produced greater activation in the cuneus than TD children. Adolescents with ASD showed reduced left IFG activation as compared to TD adolescents. Our findings suggest that TD boys may engage more in higher-level processing of retrieving or selecting semantic features while boys with ASD may rely more on lower-level visual processing during semantic judgments. The findings imply different functional organizations of the semantic system between the two groups.

AB  - Older adults perform much like younger adults on language. This similar level of performance, however, may come about through different underlying brain processes. In the present study, we evaluated age-related differences in the brain areas outside the typical language areas among adults using a category decision task. Our results showed that similar activation patterns were found in classical language processing areas across the three age groups although regional lateralization indices in Broca's and Wernicke's areas decreased with age. The greatest differences, however, among the three groups were found primarily in the brain areas not associated with core language functioning including the hippocampus, middle frontal gyrus, ventromedial frontal cortex, medial superior parietal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. Therefore, the non-classical language areas may exhibit an age-related difference between three age groups while the subjects show a similar activation pattern in the core, primary language processing during a semantic decision task. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Semantic knowledge has thematic relations of contiguity based on association and taxonomic relations of similarity based on shared features to form categories. It is unknown if there are distinct brain networks between thematic and taxonomic organizations in children and if this distinction is related to changes in specialized brain regions with age and/or skill. We orthogonally manipulated association strength (strong, weak) and categorical relatedness (high, low) to examine 10- to 14-year-old children over a two-year interval. Moreover, we examined whether initial behavioral performance predicted brain activation changes. Weak versus strong association strength produced greater activation over time in left middle temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus, and initial accuracy predicted activation changes in the latter. Moreover, high versus low categorical relatedness produced greater activation over time in left occipito-temporal cortex and precuneus, and initial accuracy predicted activation changes in the latter. These developmental findings suggest different organization for thematic and taxonomic relations. © 2018

AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to explore the neural correlates of semantic judgments in a group of 8- to 15-year-old Chinese children. Participants were asked to indicate if pairs of Chinese characters presented visually were related in meaning. The related pairs were arranged in a continuous variable according to association strength. Pairs of characters with weaker semantic association elicited greater activation in the mid ventral region (BA 45) of left inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting increased demands on the process of selecting appropriate semantic features. By contrast, characters with stronger semantic association elicited greater activation in left inferior parietal lobule (BA 39), suggesting stronger integration of highly related features. In addition, there was a developmental increase, similar to previously reported findings in English, in left posterior middle temporal gyrus (BA 21), suggesting that older children have more elaborated semantic representations. There were additional age-related increases in the posterior region of left inferior parietal lobule and in the ventral regions of left inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting that reading acquisition relies more on the mapping from orthography to semantics in Chinese children as compared to previously reported findings in English. © 2009 Chou, Chen, Fan, Chen and Booth.

AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to explore the neural correlates of semantic judgments to visual words in a group of 9- to 15-year-old children. Subjects were asked to indicate if word pairs were related in meaning. Consistent with previous findings in adults, children showed activation in bilateral inferior frontal gyri (Brodmann area [BA] 47, 45) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21). Words with strong semantic association elicited significantly greater activation in bilateral inferior parietal lobules (BA 40), suggesting stronger integration of highly related semantic features. By contrast, words with weak semantic association elicited greater activation in left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45) and middle temporal gyrus (BA 21), suggesting more difficult feature search and more extensive access to semantic representations. We also examined whether age and skill explained unique variance in the patterns of activation. Increasing age was correlated with greater activation in left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) and inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), suggesting that older children have more elaborated semantic representations and more complete semantic integration processes, respectively. Decreasing age was correlated with activation in right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22) and decreasing accuracy was correlated with activation in right middle temporal gyrus (BA 21), suggesting the engagement of ancillary systems in the right hemisphere for younger and lower-skill children. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to explore the neural correlates of semantic judgments in the auditory modality in a group of 9- to 15-year-old children. Subjects were required to indicate if word pairs were related in meaning. Consistent with previous findings in adults, children showed activation in bilateral superior temporal gyri (BA 22) for recognizing spoken words as well as activations in bilateral inferior frontal gyri (BAs 47, 45) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) for semantic processing. The neural substrates of semantic association and age differences were also investigated. Words with strong semantic association elicited significantly greater activation in the left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), whereas words with weak semantic association elicited activation in left inferior frontal gyrus (BAs 47/45). Correlations with age were observed in the left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47). The pattern of results for semantic association implies that the left inferior parietal lobule effectively integrates highly related semantic features and the left inferior frontal gyrus becomes more active for words that require a greater search for semantic associations. The developmental results suggest that older children recruit the right inferior frontal gyrus as they conduct a broader semantic search and the left middle temporal gyrus to provide more efficient access to semantic representations. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

T2  - Psychophysiology
AB  - In an investigation of the development of fine-tuning for word processing across the late elementary school years as indexed by the posterior N1 and P2 components of the ERP waveform, third, fourth, and fifth graders and a comparison group of adults viewed words, pseudowords, nonpronounceable letter strings, and false font strings in a semantic categorization task. In adults, N1 was larger to and P2 was later to words as compared to pseudowords, a finely tuned effect of lexicality reflecting specialization for word processing. In contrast, in each group of children, N1 was larger to letter strings than false font strings and P2 was larger to false font strings than letter strings, reflecting coarse encoding for orthography. In regression analyses, scores on standardized behavioral test measures of orthographic knowledge, decoding skill, and fluency predicted N1 amplitude; these effects were not significant with age included as a separate predictor. None of the behavioral scores, in models including or not including age, predicted P2 amplitude. In direct comparisons between groups, there were multiple differences between the child and adult groups for both N1 and P2 amplitude effects, and only a single significant difference between two child groups. Overall, the findings suggest a lengthy developmental time course for the fine-tuning of early word processing as indexed by N1 and P2. © 2016 Society for Psychophysiological Research.

TI  - The N400 and the fourth grade shift
AU  - Coch, D.
T2  - Developmental Science
AB  - While behavioral and educational data characterize a fourth grade shift in reading development, neuroscience evidence is relatively lacking. We used the N400 component of the event-related potential waveform to investigate the development of single word processing across the upper elementary years, in comparison to adult readers. We presented third graders, fourth graders, fifth graders, and college students with a well-controlled list of real words, pseudowords, letter strings, false font strings, and animal name targets. Words and pseudowords elicited similar N400s across groups. False font strings elicited N400s similar to words and letter strings in the three groups of children, but not in college students. The pattern of findings suggests relatively adult-like semantic and phonological processing by third grade, but a long developmental time course, beyond fifth grade, for orthographic processing in this context. Thus, the amplitude of the N400 elicited by various word-like stimuli does not reflect some sort of shift or discontinuity in word processing around the fourth grade. However, the results do suggest different developmental time courses for the processes that contribute to automatic single word reading and the integrative N400. In a developmental event-related potential study investigating the putative fourth grade shift in reading, the amplitude of the N400 component elicited by various word-like stimuli did not reflect a shift or discontinuity in word processing around the fourth grade. False font strings elicited N400s similar to real words and letter strings in third-, fourth-, and fifth-graders, but not in college students, suggesting a relatively long developmental time course - beyond fifth grade - for orthographic processing in this context. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Relationships between maternal education (ME) and both behavioral performances and brain activation during the discrimination of phonemic and nonphonemic sounds were examined using fMRI in children with different levels of phoneme categorization proficiency (CP). Significant relationships were found between ME and intellectual functioning and vocabulary, with a trend for phonological awareness. A significant interaction between CP and ME was seen for nonverbal reasoning abilities. In addition, fMRI analyses revealed a significant interaction between CP and ME for phonemic discrimination in left prefrontal cortex. Thus, ME was associated with differential patterns of both neuropsychological performance and brain activation contingent on the level of CP. These results highlight the importance of examining SES effects at different proficiency levels. The pattern of results may suggest the presence of neurobiological differences in the children with low CP that affect the nature of relationships with ME. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim. To contribute to neuropsychological profiling of developmental amnesia subsequent to bilateral damage to both hippocampi in early age. Subjects and methods. The total sample of 24 schoolchildren from both sexes is distributed in three groups: perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy and everyday complaints of memory in school age (n = 8); perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy without memory complaints (n = 7); and a group of typically developing (n = 9). All participants in every groups did have normal general intelligence and attention. Both clinical groups had, as another clinical consequence, spastic cerebral palsy (diplegia). Neuropsychological exam consisted on tests of general intelligence, attentional abilities, declarative memory and semantic knowledge. All participants had a brain magnetic resonance image and spectroscopy of hippocampi. Scheltens criteria were used for visual estimation of hippocampal atrophy. Parametric and non-parametric statistical contrasts were made. Results. Despite preservation of semantic and procedural learning, declarative-episodic memory is impaired in the first group versus the other two groups. A significant proportion of bilateral hippocampal atrophy is only present in the first group versus the other two non-amnesic groups using Scheltens estimation on MRI. Two cases without evident atrophy did have diminished NAA/(Cho + Cr) index in both hippocampi. Conclusions. Taken together, these results contribute to delineate developmental amnesia as an specific impairment due to early partial bihippocampal damage, in agreement with previous studies. After diagnosis of developmental amnesia, a specific psychoeducational intervention must be made; also this impairment could be candidate for pharmacological trials in the future. © 2018 Revista de Neurología.

TI  - Verbal and nonverbal semantic processing in children with developmental language impairment
AU  - Cummings, A.

T2  - Neuropsychologia
AB  - In an effort to clarify whether semantic integration is impaired in verbal and nonverbal auditory domains in children with developmental language impairment (a.k.a., LI and SLI), the present study obtained behavioral and neural responses to words and environmental sounds in children with language impairment and their typically developing age-matched controls (ages 7-15 years). Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded while children performed a forced-choice matching task on semantically matching and mismatching visual-auditory, picture-word and picture-environmental sound pairs. Behavioral accuracy and reaction time measures were similar for both groups of children, with environmental sounds eliciting more accurate responses than words. In picture-environmental sound trials, behavioral performance and the brain's response to semantic incongruency (i.e., the N400 effect) of the children with language impairment were comparable to those of their typically developing peers. However, in picture-word trials, children with LI tended to be less accurate than their controls and their N400 effect was significantly delayed in latency. Thus, the children with LI demonstrated a semantic integration deficit that was somewhat specific to the verbal domain. The particular finding of a delayed N400 effect is consistent with the storage deficit hypothesis of language impairment (Kail & Leonard, 1986) suggesting weakened and/or less efficient connections within the language networks of children with LI.

TI  - Learning the exception to the rule: Model-based fMRI reveals specialized representations for surprising category members

AB  - Category knowledge can be explicit, yet not conform to a perfect rule. For example, a child may acquire the rule ''If it has wings, then it is a bird,'' but then must account for exceptions to this rule, such as bats. The current study explored the neurobiological basis of rule-plus-exception learning by using quantitative predictions from a category learning model, SUSTAIN, to analyze behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. SUSTAIN predicts that exceptions require formation of specialized representations to distinguish exceptions from rule-following items in memory. By incorporating quantitative trial-by-trial predictions from SUSTAIN directly into fMRI analyses, we observed medial temporal lobe (MTL) activation consistent with 2 predicted psychological processes that enable exception learning: item recognition and error correction. SUSTAIN explains how these processes vary in the MTL across learning trials as category knowledge is acquired. Importantly, MTL engagement during exception learning was not captured by an alternate exemplar-based model of category learning or by standard contrasts comparing exception and rulefollowing items. The current findings thus provide a well-specified theory for the role of the MTL in category learning, where the MTL plays an important role in forming specialized category representations appropriate for the learning context. © The Author 2011.

AB  - Atypical functional lateralization and specialization for language have been proposed to account for developmental language disorders, yet results from functional neuroimaging studies are sparse and inconsistent. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared children with a specific subtype of specific language impairment affecting structural language (n=21), to a matched group of typically developing children using a panel of four language tasks neither requiring reading nor metalinguistic skills, including two auditory lexico-semantic tasks (category fluency and responsive naming) and two visual phonological tasks based on picture naming. Data processing involved normalizing the data with respect to a matched pairs paediatric template, groups and between-groups analysis, and laterality indices assessment within regions of interest using single and combined task analysis. Children with specific language impairment exhibited a significant lack of left lateralization in all core language regions (inferior frontal gyrus-opercularis, inferior frontal gyrus-triangularis, supramarginal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus), across single or combined task analysis, but no difference of lateralization for the rest of the brain. Between-group comparisons revealed a left hypoactivation of Wernicke's area at the posterior superior temporal/supramarginal junction during the responsive naming task, and a right hyperactivation encompassing the anterior insula with adjacent inferior frontal gyrus and the head of the caudate nucleus during the first phonological task. This study thus provides evidence that this subtype of specific language impairment is associated with atypical lateralization and functioning of core language areas. © 2011 The Author.

AB  - In the context of presurgical mapping or investigation of neurological and developmental disorders in children, language fMRI raises the issue of the design of a tasks panel achievable by young disordered children. Most language tasks shown to be efficient with healthy children require metalinguistic or reading abilities, therefore adding attentional, cognitive and academic constraints that may be problematic in this context. This study experimented a panel of four language tasks that did not require high attentional skills, reading, or metalinguistic abilities. Two reference tasks involving auditory stimulation (words generation from category, "category"; auditory responsive naming, "definition") were compared with two new tasks involving visual stimulation. These later were designed to tap spontaneous phonological production, in which the names of pictures to be named involve a phonological difference (e.g. in French poule/. boule/. moule; "phon-diff") or change of segmentation (e.g. in French car/car-te/car-t-on; "phon-seg"). Eighteen healthy children participated (mean age: 12.7±3. years). Data processing involved normalizing the data via a matched pairs pediatric template, and inter-task and region of interest analyses with laterality assessment. The reference tasks predominantly activated the left frontal and temporal core language regions, respectively. The new tasks activated these two regions simultaneously, more strongly for the phon-seg task. The union and intersection of all tasks provided more sensitive or specific maps. The study demonstrates that both reference and new tasks highlight core language regions in children, and that the latter are useful for the mapping of spontaneous phonological processing. The use of several different tasks may improve the sensitivity and specificity of fMRI. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Event-related potentials were used to determine whether infants, like adults, show differences in spatial and temporal characteristics of brain activation during face and object recognition. Three aspects of visual processing were identified: (a) differentiation of face vs. object (P400 at occipital electrode was shorter latency for faces), (b) recognition of familiar identity (Nc, or negative component, at fronto-temporal electrodes [FTEs] was of larger amplitude for familiar stimuli), and (c) encoding novelty (slow wave at FTEs was larger for unfamiliar stimuli). The topography of the Nc was influenced by category type: Effects of familiarity were limited to the midline and right anterior temporal electrodes for faces but extended to all temporal electrodes for objects. Results show that infants' experience with specific examples within categories and their general category knowledge influence the neural correlates of visual processing.

AB  - How does education affect cortical organization? All literate adults possess a region specialized for letter strings, the visual word form area (VWFA), within the mosaic of ventral regions involved in processing other visual categories such as objects, places, faces, or body parts. Therefore, the acquisition of literacy may induce a reorientation of cortical maps towards letters at the expense of other categories such as faces. To test this cortical recycling hypothesis, we studied how the visual cortex of individual children changes during the first months of reading acquisition. Ten 6-year-old children were scanned longitudinally 6 or 7 times with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and throughout the first year of school. Subjects were exposed to a variety of pictures (words, numbers, tools, houses, faces, and bodies) while performing an unrelated target-detection task. Behavioral assessment indicated a sharp rise in grapheme–phoneme knowledge and reading speed in the first trimester of school. Concurrently, voxels specific to written words and digits emerged at the VWFA location. The responses to other categories remained largely stable, although right-hemispheric face-related activity increased in proportion to reading scores. Retrospective examination of the VWFA voxels prior to reading acquisition showed that reading encroaches on voxels that are initially weakly specialized for tools and close to but distinct from those responsive to faces. Remarkably, those voxels appear to keep their initial category selectivity while acquiring an additional and stronger responsivity to words. We propose a revised model of the neuronal recycling process in which new visual categories invade weakly specified cortex while leaving previously stabilized cortical responses unchanged. © 2018 Dehaene-Lambertz et al.

AB  - We explored how developing neural artifact and animal representations in the dorsal and ventral stream play a role in children's increasingly more proficient interactions with objects. In thirty-three 6- to 10-year-old children and 11 adults, we used fMRI to track the development of (1) the cortical category preference for tools compared to animals and (2) the response to complex objects (as compared to scrambled objects) during a passive viewing task. In addition, we related a cognitive skill that improved substantially from age 6 to 10, namely the ability to recognize tools from unusual viewpoints, to the development of cortical object processing. In multiple complementary analyses we showed that those children who were better at recognizing tools from unusual viewpoints outside the scanner showed a reduced cortical response to tools and animals when viewed inside the scanner, bilaterally in intraparietal and inferotemporal cortex. In contrast, the cortical preference for tools in the dorsal and ventral visual stream did not predict object recognition performance, and was organized in an adult-like manner at six. While cortical tool preference did not change with age, the findings suggest that animal-preferring regions in the ventral visual stream may develop later, concordant with previous reports of a protracted development in similar regions for faces. We thus conclude that intraparietal and inferotemporal cortical networks that support aspects of object processing irrespective of tool or animal category, continue to develop during the school-age years and contribute to the development of object recognition skills during this period. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Learning to read involves associating abstract visual shapes with familiar meanings. Embodiment theories suggest that word meaning is at least partially represented in distributed sensorimotor networks in the brain (Barsalou, 2008; Pulvermueller, 2013). We explored how reading comprehension develops by tracking when and how printed words start activating these "semantic" sensorimotor representations as children learn to read. Adults and children aged 7-10. years showed clear category-specific cortical specialization for tool versus animal pictures during a one-back categorisation task. Thus, sensorimotor representations for these categories were in place at all ages. However, co-activation of these same brain regions by the visual objects' written names was only present in adults, even though all children could read and comprehend all presented words, showed adult-like task performance, and older children were proficient readers. It thus takes years of training and expert reading skill before spontaneous processing of printed words' sensorimotor meanings develops in childhood. © 2014 The Authors.

The functional anatomy of single word reading in patients with hemianopic and pure alexia. Brain, 124, 510-521, 2001] all highlight the importance of the left posterior fusiform cortex in visual word recognition. We used visual masked priming and functional magnetic resonance imaging to elucidate the specific functional contribution of this region to reading and found that (1) unlike words, repetition of pseudowords ("solst-solst") did not produce a neural priming effect in this region, (2) orthographically related words such as "corner-corn" did produce a neural priming effect, but (3) this orthographic priming effect was reduced when prime-target pairs were semantically related ("teacher-teach"). These findings conflict with the notion of stored visual word forms and instead suggest that this region acts as an interface between visual form information and higher order stimulus properties such as its associated sound and meaning. More importantly, this function is not specific to reading but is also engaged when processing any meaningful visual stimulus. © 2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Aims: To assess the long-term outcome of childhood tuberculous meningitis treated with modern 4-drug antitubercular regimens and to determine predictors of survival and morbidity. Methods: In this single-center prospective cohort, outcome of children with tuberculous meningitis treated with standard regimens was assessed at 6 months and 12 months after discharge using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale. Results: Of 130 children, 38 died in hospital and 34 were either severely disabled or comatose/vegetative at discharge. At 6 and 12 months, 87% of the survivors were either normal (n = 62) or mildly disabled (n = 17, on the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scale). On multivariate analysis, the factors associated with poor outcome at 12 months were stage III at admission (adjusted odds ratio 4.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.7-11.2, P =.002) and presence of infarcts on neuroimaging (adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.6, P =.037). Conclusions: Despite the high in-hospital mortality, in resource-constraint settings, the survivors showed remarkable improvement, with two-thirds returning to a normal functional status at 6 months' follow-up. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Motor outcome is variable following neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (NAIS). We analyzed the relationship between lesion characteristics on brain MRI and motor function in children who had suffered from NAIS. Thirty eight full term born children with unilateral NAIS were investigated at the age of seven. 3D T1- and 3D FLAIR-weighted MR images were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Lesion characteristics were compared between patients with and without cerebral palsy (CP) using the following approaches: lesion localization either using a category-based analysis, lesion mapping as well as voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM). Using diffusion-weighted imaging the microstructure of the cortico-spinal tract (CST) was related to the status of CP by measuring DTI parameters. Whereas children with lesions sparing the primary motor system did not develop CP, CP was always present when extensive lesions damaged at least two brain structures involving the motor system. The VLSM approach provided a statistical map that confirmed the cortical lesions in the primary motor system and revealed that CP was highly correlated with lesions in close proximity to the CST. In children with CP, diffusion parameters indicated microstructural changes in the CST at the level of internal capsule and the centrum semiovale. White matter damage of the CST in centrum semiovale was a highly reproducible marker of CP. This is the first description of the implication of this latter region in motor impairment after NAIS. In conclusion, CP in childhood was closely linked to the location of the infarct in the motor system. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4793-4807, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Predictors of neuropsychological test performance after pediatric traumatic brain injury
AU  - Donders, J.

T2  - Assessment
AB  - The influence of neurological and demographic variables on neuropsychological test performance was examined in 100 9- to 16-year-old children with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Regression analyses were conducted to determine the relative contributions of coma, neuroimaging findings, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and gender to variance in performance on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III), California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C), and the Children's Category Test. Both neurological and demographic variables contributed to performance on various WISC-III factor index scores as well as the CVLT-C. No evidence for a moderating effect of demographic variables was found, but speed of information processing mediated the effect of neurological and demographic variables on CLVT-C performance. It is concluded that demographic variables have an incremental effect on the neuropsychological test performance of children with TBI above and beyond the influence of injury severity. © 2004 Sage Publications.

TI  - A connectionist model of category learning by individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder
AU  - Dovgopoly, A.
AU  - Mercado III, E.
T2  - Cognitive, Affective and Behavioral Neuroscience
AB  - Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show atypical patterns of learning and generalization. We explored the possible impacts of autism-related neural abnormalities on perceptual category learning using a neural network model of visual cortical processing. When applied to experiments in which children or adults were trained to classify complex two-dimensional images, the model can account for atypical patterns of perceptual generalization. This is only possible, however, when individual differences in learning are taken into account. In particular, analyses performed with a self-organizing map suggested that individuals with high-functioning ASD show two distinct generalization patterns: one that is comparable to typical patterns, and a second in which there is almost no generalization. The model leads to novel predictions about how individuals will generalize when trained with simplified input sets and can explain why some researchers have failed to detect learning or generalization deficits in prior studies of category learning by individuals with autism. On the basis of these simulations, we propose that deficits in basic neural plasticity mechanisms may be sufficient to account for the atypical patterns of perceptual category learning and generalization associated with autism, but they do not account for why only a subset of individuals with autism would show such deficits. If variations in performance across subgroups reflect heterogeneous neural abnormalities, then future behavioral and neuroimaging studies of individuals with ASD will need to account for such disparities. © 2013 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

AB  - Learning with discriminative methods is generally based on minimizing the misclassification of training samples, which may be unsuitable for imbalanced datasets where the recognition might be biased in favor of the most numerous class. This problem can be addressed with a generative approach, which typically requires more parameters to be determined leading to reduced performances in high dimension. In such situations, dimension reduction becomes a crucial issue. We propose a feature selection/classification algorithm based on generative methods in order to predict the clinical status of a highly imbalanced dataset made of PET scans of forty-five low-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and thirteen non-ASD low functioning children. ASDs are typically characterized by impaired social interaction, narrow interests, and repetitive behaviors, with a high variability in expression and severity. The numerous findings revealed by brain imaging studies suggest that ASD is associated with a complex and distributed pattern of abnormalities that makes the identification of a shared and common neuroimaging profile a difficult task. In this context, our goal is to identify the rest functional brain imaging abnormalities pattern associated with ASD and to validate its efficiency in individual classification. The proposed feature selection algorithm detected a characteristic pattern in the ASD group that included a hypoperfusion in the right Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) and a hyperperfusion in the contralateral postcentral area. Our algorithm allowed for a significantly accurate (88%), sensitive (91%) and specific (77%) prediction of clinical category. For this imbalanced dataset, with only 13 control scans, the proposed generative algorithm outperformed other state-of-the-art discriminant methods. The high predictive power of the characteristic pattern, which has been automatically identified on whole brains without any priors, confirms previous findings concerning the role of STS in ASD. This work offers exciting possibilities for early autism detection and/or the evaluation of treatment response in individual patients. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - During reading acquisition children learn to recognize orthographic stimuli and link them to phonology and semantics. The present study investigated neurocognitive processes of learning to read after one year of schooling. We aimed to elucidate the cognitive processes underlying neural tuning for print that has been shown to play an important role for reading and dyslexia. A 128-channel EEG was recorded while 68 (Swiss-)German monolingual first grade children (mean age: 7.6) performed a one-back task with different types of letter and false-font strings. Print tuning was indexed by the N1 difference in the ERPs between German words and false-font strings, while the N1 lexicality effect was indexed by the difference between German words and pseudowords. In addition, we measured reading fluency, rapid automatized naming, phonological awareness, auditory memory span, and vocabulary. After one year of formal reading instruction N1 print tuning was clearly present at the group level, and could be detected at the individual level in almost 90% of the children. The N1 lexicality effect, however, could not be reliably found. On the cognitive level, next to word-reading fluency, vocabulary was also associated with N1 print tuning, but not measures reflecting phonological processing. These results demonstrate the presence of print tuning in the first year of reading acquisition and its development at the individual level. Moreover, individual differences in print tuning are not only related to word-reading fluency, but also to semantic knowledge, indicating that at early stages of learning to read the top-down modulation of print tuning is semantic rather than phonological in nature. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T2  - Oncologist
AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors (GCTs) represent approximately 3% of primary pediatric brain tumors and encompass a wide pathologic spectrum. CNS GCTs are most commonly located in the pineal and suprasellar regions of the brain and can be divided into major groups including germinomas and nongerminomatous GCTs (NGGCTs), with teratomas often considered a separate category. The clinical presentation varies by location and size, and it frequently includes endocrine abnormalities, visual changes, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Neuroimaging studies cannot differentiate GCTs from other tumors, and therefore, the diagnosis usually requires histologic confirmation. The rare exceptions are the cases where characteristic elevations of tumor markers, including alpha-fetoprotein and/or β-human chorionic gonadotropin are documented in the serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. In these cases, the imaging findings along with the tumor marker elevation may be diagnostic in themselves without the need for tissue confirmation. Treatment and prognosis differ greatly between groups. Germinomas have a superior prognosis than NGGCTs. Five-year overall survival rates >90% were reported initially with the use of craniospinal irradiation. More recently, the use of chemotherapy in addition to radiation therapy has afforded the ability to decrease the dose and volume of radiation therapy without affecting survival rates. NGGCTs are less radiosensitive than germinomas, but the use of adjuvant chemotherapy has improved survival rates in this group as well. The standard management for CNS GCTs remains controversial. Treatment regimens aimed to improve progression-free and overall survival times are ongoing. ©AlphaMed Press.

AB  - Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a complex manifestation of symptoms that include deficits in social interaction and repetitive or stereotyped interests and behaviors. In keeping with the increasing recognition of the dimensional characteristics of ASD symptoms and the categorical nature of a diagnosis, we sought to delineate the neural mechanisms of ASD symptoms based on the functional connectivity of four known neural networks (i.e., default mode network, dorsal attention network, salience network, and executive control network). Methods We leveraged an open data resource (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) providing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets from 90 boys with ASD and 95 typically developing boys. This data set also included the Social Responsiveness Scale as a dimensional measure of ASD traits. Seed-based functional connectivity was paired with linear regression to identify functional connectivity abnormalities associated with categorical effects of ASD diagnosis, dimensional effects of ASD-like behaviors, and their interaction. Results Our results revealed the existence of dimensional mechanisms of ASD uniquely affecting each network based on the presence of connectivity-behavioral relationships; these were independent of diagnostic category. However, we also found evidence of categorical differences (i.e., diagnostic group differences) in connectivity strength for each network as well as categorical differences in connectivity-behavioral relationships (i.e., diagnosis-by-behavior interactions), supporting the coexistence of categorical mechanisms of ASD. Conclusions Our findings support a hybrid model for ASD characterization that includes a combination of categorical and dimensional brain mechanisms and provide a novel understanding of the neural underpinnings of ASD. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry

TI  - The relationship of gamma oscillations and face-specific ERPs recorded subdurally from occipitotemporal cortex
AU  - Engell, A.D.

T2  - Cerebral Cortex
AB  - The perception of faces evokes characteristic electrophysiological responses at discrete loci in human fusiform gyrus and adjacent ventral occipitotemporal cortical sites. Prominent among these responses are a surface-negative potential at ∼200-ms postonset (face-N200) and face-induced spectral perturbations in the gamma band (face-γERSP). The degree to which these responses represent activity in the same cortical loci and the degree to which they are influenced by the same perceptual and task variables are unknown. We evaluated this anatomical colocalization and functional correlation in 2 experiments in which the electrocorticogram was recorded from subdural electrodes in 51 participants. Experiment 1 investigated the category specificity of the γERSP and its colocalization with the face-N200. Experiment 2 examined differences in face-N200 and face-γERSP to face stimuli that varied in featural complexity. We found that γERSP is a category-specific phenomenon with separate, though overlapping, category sensitivities as the N200. Further, the presence of face-γERSP at an electrode site significantly predicted the presence and amplitude of face-N200 at that site. However, the converse was not true in that face-N200 was evoked by impoverished face stimuli that did not induce face-γERSP. These results demonstrate that these electrophysiological responses reflect separate components of the brain's face processing system. © The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Primary objective: The long-term effects of TBI on verbal fluency and related structures, as well as the relation between cognition and structural integrity, were evaluated. It was hypothesized that the group with TBI would evidence poorer performance on cognitive measures and a decrease in structural integrity. Research design: Between a paediatric group with TBI and a group of typically-developing children, the long-term effects of traumatic brain injury were investigated in relation to both structural integrity and cognition. Common metrics for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used as indicators of white matter integrity. Methods and procedures: Using DTI, this study examined ventral striatum (VS) integrity in 21 patients aged 10–18 years sustaining moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) 5–15 years earlier and 16 demographically comparable subjects. All participants completed Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System (D-KEFS) sub-tests. Main outcomes and results: The group with TBI exhibited lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and executive functioning performance and higher apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). DTI metrics correlated with D-KEFS performance (right VS FA with Inhibition errors, right VS ADC with Letter Fluency, left VS FA and ADC with Category Switching). Conclusions: TBI affects VS integrity, even in a chronic phase, and may contribute to executive functioning deficits. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Children with congenital left hemisphere damage due to perinatal stroke are capable of acquiring relatively normal language functions despite experiencing a cortical insult that in adults often leads to devastating lifetime disabilities. Although this observed phenomenon is accepted, its neurobiological mechanisms are not well characterized. In this paper we examined the functional neuroanatomy of lexical processing in 13 children/adolescents with perinatal left hemispheric damage. In contrast to many previous perinatal infarct fMRI studies, we used an event-related design, which allowed us to isolate trial-related activity and examine correct and error trials separately. Using both group and single subject analysis techniques we attempt to address several methodological factors that may contribute to some discrepancies in the perinatal lesion literature. These methodological factors include making direct statistical comparisons, using common stereotactic space, using both single subject and group analyses, and accounting for performance differences. Our group analysis, investigating correct trial-related activity (separately from error trials), showed very few statistical differences in the non-involved right hemisphere between patients and performance matched controls. The single subject analysis revealed atypical regional activation patterns in several patients; however, the location of these regions identified in individual patients often varied across subjects. These results are consistent with the idea that alternative functional organization of trial-related activity after left hemisphere lesions is in large part unique to the individual. In addition, reported differences between results obtained with event-related designs and blocked designs may suggest diverging organizing principles for sustained and trial-related activity after early childhood brain injuries. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Previous studies have investigated the developmental differences of semantic processing regarding brain activation between adults and children. However, little is known about whether the patterns of structural connectivity and effective connectivity differ between adults and children during semantic processing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) were used to study the developmental differences of brain activation, structural connectivity, and effective connectivity during semantic judgments. Twenty-six children (8- to 12-year-olds) and 26 adults were asked to indicate if character pairs were related in meaning. Compared to children, adults showed greater activation in the left ventral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Also, adults had significantly greater structural connectivity in the left ventral pathway (inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, IFOF) than children. Moreover, adults showed significantly stronger bottom-up effects from left fusiform gyrus (FG) to ventral IFG than children in the related condition. In conclusion, our findings suggest that age-related increases in brain activation (ventral IFG and MTG), IFOF, and effective connectivity (from FG to ventral IFG) might be associated with the bottom-up influence of orthographic representations on retrieving semantic representations for processing Chinese characters. © Copyright © 2020 Fan, Lo, Hsu, Chen, Tseng and Chou.

AB  - Behavioral evidence for an impaired ability to group objects based on similar physical or semantic properties in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been mixed. Here, we recorded brain activity from high-functioning children with ASD as they completed a visual-target detection task. We then assessed the extent to which object-based selective attention automatically generalized from targets to non-target exemplars from the same well-known object class (e.g., dogs). Our results provide clear electrophysiological evidence that children with ASD (N = 17, aged 8-13 years) process the similarity between targets (e.g., a specific dog) and same-category non-targets (SCNT) (e.g., another dog) to a lesser extent than do their typically developing (TD) peers (N = 21). A closer examination of the data revealed striking hemispheric asymmetries that were specific to the ASD group. These findings align with mounting evidence in the autism literature of anatomic underconnectivity between the cerebral hemispheres. Years of research in individuals with TD have demonstrated that the left hemisphere (LH) is specialized toward processing local (or featural) stimulus properties and the right hemisphere (RH) toward processing global (or configural) stimulus properties. We therefore propose a model where a lack of communication between the hemispheres in ASD, combined with typical hemispheric specialization, is a root cause for impaired categorization and the oft-observed bias to process local over global stimulus properties. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Event‐related potentials were recorded in a developmental study of picture matching using an adaptation of Posner's (1978) letter‐matching tasks. Subjects ranging in age from 6–39 were asked to decide whether two line drawings, presented sequentially, were the same or different on the basis of physical (physical identity), nominal (name identity), or categorical (category identity) criteria. The amplitude of a negativity at 400 ms (Neg400) increased as the number of dimensions on which the two line drawings differed increased. This effect held for all age groups, and was interpreted as reflecting the degree of semantic and/or physical relationship between the two pictures. However, one finding for Neg400 did suggest a qualitative difference in processing mode between the younger and older subjects. Both Neg400 and P3b latencies showed highly significant linear age trends, decreasing with increasing age. These age‐related changes were interpreted as demonstrating quantitative speed of processing differences among age groups. The latencies of both Neg400 and P3b increased as the matching criteria became more complex. Moreover, P3b latency increased as the number of dimensions on which the two pictures differed increased, and this did not interact with age. Although both Neg400 and P3b showed age‐related changes in scalp distribution, the fact that each was related to the experimental variables in similar fashion in all age groups suggested that they were homologous components across the age range studied. Taken as a whole, the data support continuity of information processing during these tasks across a wide age range. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The present study used the N400, an electrophysiological correlate of semantic processing, to investigate 19- and 24-month-old children's ability to integrate the meaning of words in a sentential context. Children listened passively to semantically appropriate sentences and to sentences in which the object noun violates the selection restriction of the verb. The event-related potentials of both age groups revealed an N400 on inappropriate object nouns. This indicates that the children are able to semantically integrate words into sentence contexts. Furthermore, the result implies that selection restrictions are part of the children's first verb representations. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - During their first year of life, infants not only acquire probabilistic knowledge about the phonetic, prosodic, and phonotactic organization of their native language, but also begin to establish first lexical-semantic representations. The present study investigated the sensitivity to phonotactic regularities and its impact on semantic processing in 1-yearolds. We applied the method of event-related brain potentials to 12- and 19-month-old children and to an adult control group. While looking at pictures of known objects, subjects listened to spoken nonsense words that were phonotactically legal (pseudowords) or had phonotactically illegal word onsets (nonwords), or to real words that were either congruous or incongruous to the picture contents. In 19-month-olds and in adults, incongruous words and pseudowords, but not nonwords, elicited an N400 known to reflect mechanisms of semantic integration. For congruous words, the N400 was attenuated by semantic priming. In contrast, 12-month-olds did not show an N400 difference, neither between pseudo- and nonwords nor between incongruous and congruous words. Both 1-year-old groups and adults additionally displayed a lexical priming effect for congruous words, that is, a negativity starting around 100 msec after words onset. One-year-olds, moreover, displayed a phonotactic familiarity effect, that is, a widely distributed negativity starting around 250 msec in 19-month-olds but occurring later in 12-month-olds. The results imply that both lexical priming and phonotactic familiarity already affect the processing of acoustic stimuli in children at 12 months of age. In 19-month-olds, adult-like mechanisms of semantic integration are present in response to phonotactically legal, but not to phonotactically illegal, nonsense words, indicating that children at this age treat pseudowords, but not nonwords, as potential word candidates. © 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - The processes that characterize the neural development of long-term memory (LTM) are largely unknown. In young adults, the degree of activation of a single large-scale memory network corresponds to the level of contextual detail involved; thus, differentiating between autobiographical, episodic, and semantic retrieval. In contrast to young adults, children and adolescents retrieve fewer contextual details, suggesting that they might not yet engage the entire memory circuitry and that this brain recruitment might lack the characteristic contextual differentiation found in adults. Twenty-one children (10–12 years of age), 20 adolescents (14–16 years of age), and 22 young adults (20–35 years of age) were assessed on a previously validated LTM retrieval task, while their brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results demonstrate that children, adolescents, and adults recruit a left-lateralized subset of the large-scale memory network, comprising semantic and language processing regions, with neither developmental group showing evidence of contextual differentiation within this network. Additionally, children and adolescents recruited occipital and parietal regions during all memory recall conditions, in contrast to adults who engaged the entire large-scale memory network, as described previously. Finally, a significant covariance between age and brain activation indicates that the reliance on occipital and parietal regions during memory retrieval decreases with age. These results suggest that both children and adolescents rely on semantic processing to retrieve long-term memories, which, we argue, may restrict the integration of contextual detail required for complex episodic and autobiographical memory retrieval. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Language delay and impairment are salient features of autism. More specifically, there is evidence of atypical semantic organization in autism, but the functional brain correlates are not well understood. The current study used functional MRI to examine activation associated with semantic category decision. Ten high-functioning men with autism spectrum disorder and 10 healthy control subjects matched for gender, handedness, age, and nonverbal IQ were studied. Participants indicated via button press response whether visually presented words belonged to a target category (tools, colors, feelings). The control condition required target letter detection in unpronounceable letter strings. Significant activation for semantic decision in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 44 and 45) was found in the control group. Corresponding activation in the autism group was more limited, with smaller clusters in left inferior frontal areas 45 and 47. Autistic participants, however, showed significantly greater activation compared to controls in extrastriate visual cortex bilaterally (areas 18 and 19), which correlated with greater number of errors on the semantic task. Our findings suggest an important role of perceptual components (possibly visual imagery) during semantic decision, consistent with previous evidence of atypical lexicosemantic performance in autism. In the context of similar findings from younger typically developing children, our results suggest an immature pattern associated with inefficient processing, presumably due to atypical experiential embedding of word acquisition in autism. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and consequent apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps have been used for lesion detection and as a predictor of outcome in adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but few studies have been reported in children. We evaluated the role of DWI and ADC for outcome prediction after pediatric TBI (n = 37 TBI; n = 10 controls). Fifteen regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn on ADC maps that were grouped for analysis into peripheral gray matter, peripheral white matter, deep gray and white matter, and posterior fossa. All ROIs excluded areas that appeared abnormal on T2-weighted images (T2WI). Acute injury severity was measured using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and 6-12-month outcomes were assessed using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale (PCPCS) score. Patients were categorized into five groups: (1) controls; (2) all TBI patients; (3) mild/moderate TBI with good outcomes; (4) severe TBI with good outcomes; and (5) severe TBI with poor outcomes. ADC values in the peripheral white matter were significantly reduced in children with severe TBI with poor outcomes (72.8 ± 14.4 × 10-3 mm2/sec) compared to those with severe TBI and good outcomes (82.5 ± 3.8 × 10-3 mm 2/sec; p &lt; 0.05). We also found that the average total brain ADC value alone had the greatest ability to predict outcome and could correctly predict outcome in 84% of cases. Assessment of DWI and ADC values in pediatric TBI is useful in evaluating injury, particularly in brain regions that appear normal on conventional imaging. Early identification of children at high risk for poor outcome may assist in aggressive clinical management of pediatric TBI patients. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Information on normal functional organization and development of the ventral processing stream in 5- to 11-year-old children is minimal. The present fMRI study identified neural correlates for face and object processing in children aged 5-8 and 9-11 years, with data from a similar adult study used for comparison. All age groups showed face-preferential activation in the ventral processing stream, but adults and children aged 9-11 years showed face-preferential loci near the classically defined fusiform face area, whereas children aged 5-8 years showed this activation in the posterior ventral processing stream. In addition, the degree of category-selectivity in other brain regions increased with age. Collectively, these developmental changes may reflect fine-tuning in visual recognition processes based on learning and experience. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Objective Children with epilepsy often have reorganization of language networks and abnormal brain anatomy, making determination of language lateralization difficult. We characterized the proportion and distribution of language task activation in the cerebellum to determine the relationship to cerebral language lateralization. Methods Forty-six pediatric epilepsy surgery candidates (aged 7-19 years) completed an fMRI auditory semantic decision language task. Distribution of activated voxels and language laterality indices were computed using: (a) Broca's and Wernicke's areas and their right cerebral homologues; and (b) left and right cerebellar hemispheres. Language task activation was anatomically localized in the cerebellum. Results Lateralized language task activation in either cerebral hemisphere was highly correlated with lateralized language task activation in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere (Broca vs. cerebellar: ρ = -0.54, p < 0.01). Cerebellar language activation was located within Crus I/II, areas previously implicated in non-motor functional networks. Conclusions Cerebellar language activation occurs in homologous regions of Crus I/II contralateral to cerebral language activation in patients with both right and left cerebral language dominance. Cerebellar language laterality could contribute to comprehensive pre-operative evaluation of language lateralization in pediatric epilepsy surgery patients. Our data suggest that patients with atypical cerebellar language activation are at risk for having atypical cerebral language organization. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become part of routine brain mapping in patients with epilepsy or tumor undergoing resective surgery. However, robust localization of crucial functional areas is required. OBJECTIVE: To establish a simple, short fMRI task that reliably localizes crucial language areas in individual patients who undergo respective surgery. METHODS: fMRI was measured during an 8-minute auditory semantic decision task in 28 healthy controls and 35 consecutive patients who had focal epilepsy or a brain tumor. Nineteen underwent resective surgery. Group and individual analyses were performed. Results in patients were compared with postsurgical language outcome and electrocortical stimulation when available. RESULTS: fMRI activations concordant with the anterior and posterior language areas were found in 96% and 89% of the controls, respectively. The anterior and posterior language areas were both activated in 93% of the patients. These results were concordant with electrocortical stimulation results in 5 patients. Transient postsurgical language deficits were found in 2 patients in whom surgery was performed in the vicinity of the fMRI activations or who had postsurgical complications implicating areas of fMRI activations. CONCLUSION: The proposed fast fMRI language protocol reliably localized the most relevant language areas in individual subjects. It appears to be a valuable complementary tool for surgical planning of epileptogenic foci and of brain tumors. Copyright © 2012 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

AB  - Whether verbal labels help infants visually process and categorize objects is a contentious issue. Using electroencephalography, we investigated whether possessing familiar or novel labels for objects directly enhances 1-year-old children's neural processes underlying the perception of those objects. We found enhanced gamma-band (20-60 Hz) oscillatory activity over the visual cortex in response to seeing objects with labels familiar to the infant (Experiment 1) and those with novel labels just taught to the infant (Experiment 2). No such effect was observed for objects that infants were familiar with but had no label for. These results demonstrate that learning verbal labels modulates how the visual system processes the images of the associated objects and suggest a possible top-down influence of semantic knowledge on object perception. © 2010 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - High-level visual cortex in humans includes functionally defined regions that preferentially respond to objects, faces and places. It is unknown how these regions develop and whether their development relates to recognition memory. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the development of several functionally defined regions including object (lateral occipital complex, LOC)-, face ('fusiform face area', FFA; superior temporal sulcus, STS)- and place ('parahippocampal place area', PPA)-selective cortices in children (ages 7-11), adolescents (12-16) and adults. Right FFA and left PPA volumes were substantially larger in adults than in children. This development occurred by expansion of FFA and PPA into surrounding cortex and was correlated with improved recognition memory for faces and places, respectively. In contrast, LOC and STS volumes and object-recognition memory remained constant across ages. Thus, the ventral stream undergoes a prolonged maturation that varies temporally across functional regions, is determined by brain region rather than stimulus category, and is correlated with the development of category-specific recognition memory. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - Pediatric arteriopathies are increasingly recognized in school-aged children with a variety of presenting symptoms ranging from headache, seizures, encephalopathy, and neuropsychiatric symptoms as well as focal neurologic deficits due to acute ischemic strokes. However, unlike the adult stroke population, there are differences in the clinical manifestations, the stroke mechanism, and risk factors in pediatric ischemic stroke. There has been increasing awareness and recognition of pediatric cerebral arteriopathies as a predominant stroke etiology. Prompt diagnosis of arteriopathies is essential to limit injury and prevent recurrent stroke. Based on predominant vessels involved and clinical symptoms, these arteriopathies can be broadly divided into two categories: large-medium size arteriopathies and small vessel arteriopathies. Each category can be further divided into inflammatory and noninflammatory according to their etiologies. The ability to distinguish between inflammatory and noninflammatory etiologies carries major prognostic implications for acute management and secondary stroke prevention as well as screening for systemic complications and counseling. © 2019 by the American Society of Neuroimaging

AB  - Reading is an acquired skill that relies on cognitive-control and language abilities. Home reading environment has been positively correlated with activation in parietal-temporal-occipital association cortex supporting mental imagery and narrative comprehension during a story-listening task in preschool-age children. However, the degree to which maternal reading ability influences early brain development, specifically neural circuits involved with language and reading, is not well understood. The current study explored the relationship between maternal reading ability and functional connectivity within the language network, between the language network and networks related to cognitive control and visual processing, as well as between the language network and the entire brain (network-to-voxel analysis) of preschool-age children during a resting state. Thirteen 4-year-old girls and their mothers participated in this study, involving cognitive testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging, including a resting-state scan. Maternal reading ability was negatively correlated with functional connectivity within the child's language network at rest, and also with areas involved in visual processing, cognitive-control, and semantics. These results suggest that children whose mothers exhibit decreased reading ability may demonstrate a greater engagement of the language network and neural circuits related to visual word recognition, cognitive-control, and semantic processing, which later in life support reading. © 2018

AB  - Language in high-functioning autism is characterized by pragmatic and semantic deficits, and people with autism have a reduced tendency to integrate information. Because the left and right inferior frontal (LIF and RIF) regions are implicated with integration of speaker information, world knowledge, and semantic knowledge, we hypothesized that abnormal functioning of the LIF and RIF regions might contribute to pragmatic and semantic language deficits in autism. Brain activation of sixteen 12-to 18-year-old, high-functioning autistic participants was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging during sentence comprehension and compared with that of twenty-six matched controls. The content of the pragmatic sentence was congruent or incongruent with respect to the speaker characteristics (male/female, child/adult, and upper class/lower class). The semantic-and world-knowledge sentences were congruent or incongruent with respect to semantic expectancies and factual expectancies about the world, respectively. In the semantic-knowledge and world-knowledge condition, activation of the LIF region did not differ between groups. In sentences that required integration of speaker information, the autism group showed abnormally reduced activation of the LIF region. The results suggest that people with autism may recruit the LIF region in a different manner in tasks that demand integration of social information. The Author © 2009.

AB  - EEG/VEP and fMRI responses to periodic visual stimulation are reported. The purpose of these experiments was to look for similar patterns in the time series produced by each method to help understand the relationship between the two. The stimulation protocol was the same for both sets of experiments and consisted of five complete cycles of checkerboard pattern reversal at 1.87 Hz for 30 s followed by 30 s of a stationary checkerboard. The fMRI data was analyzed using standard methods, while the EEG was analyzed with a new measurement of activation - the VEPEG. Both VEPEG and fMRI time series contain the fundamental frequency of the stimulus and quasi harmonic components - an unexplained double frequency commonly found in fMRI data. These results have prompted a reappraisal of the methods for analyzing fMRI data and have suggested a connection between our findings and much older published invasive electrophysiological measurements of blood flow and the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Overall our new analysis suggests that fMRI signals are strongly dependant on hydraulic blood flow effects. We distinguish three categories of fMRI signal corresponding to: focal activated regions of brain tissue; diffuse nonspecific regions of steal; and major cerebral vessels of arterial supply or venous drainage. Each category of signal has its own finger print in frequency, amplitude, and phase. Finally, we put forward the hypothesis that modulations in blood flow are not only the consequence but are also the cause of modulations in functional activity.

AB  - In three patients hemiparesis was a manifestation of focal Seizures. In all, there were electroencephalographic abnormalities and radionucleotide uptake in the contralateral hemisphere. Treatment of the Seizures resulted in clearing of both paralysis and abnormal brain scan. These patients fit the diagnostic category described by Higier as a "paralytic equivalent of epilepsy without disturbance of consciousness in the form of status hemiparalyticus," and described by others as inhibitory Seizures or partial Seizures with subsequent hemigeneralization. The etiology of the paralysis and its relation to Todd paralysis are not clear, but it may result from excessive inhibitory discharge. © 1978 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of nonconvulsive seizures in children with abusive head trauma. Design: Retrospective study of children with abusive head trauma undergoing clinically indicated continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. Setting: PICU of a tertiary care hospital. Subjects: Children less than or equal to 2 years old with evidence of abusive head trauma determined by neuroimaging, physical examination, and determination of abuse by the Child Protection Team. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Thirty-two children with abusive head trauma were identified with a median age of 4 months (interquartile range 3, 5.5 months). Twenty-one of 32 children (66%) underwent electroencephalographic monitoring. Those monitored were more likely to have a lower admission Glasgow Coma Scale (8 vs 15, p = 0.05) and be intubated (16 vs 2, p = 0.002). Electrographic seizures occurred in 12 of 21 children (57%) and constituted electrographic status epilepticus in 8 of 12 children (67%). Electrographic seizures were entirely nonconvulsive in 8 of 12 children (67%). Electroencephalographic background category (discontinuous and slow-disorganized) (p = 0.02) and neuroimaging evidence of ischemia were associated with the presence of electrographic seizures (p = 0.05). Subjects who had electrographic seizures were no more likely to have clinical seizures at admission (67% electrographic seizures vs 33% none, p = 0.6), parenchymal imaging abnormalities (61% electrographic seizures vs 39% none, p = 0.40), or extra-axial imaging abnormalities (56% electrographic seizures vs 44% none, p = 0.72). Four of 21 (19%) children died prior to discharge; none had electrographic seizures, but all had attenuated-featureless electroencephalographic backgrounds. Follow-up outcome data were available for 16 of 17 survivors at a median duration of 9.5 months following PICU admission, and the presence of electrographic seizures or electrographic status epilepticus was not associated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale score (p = 0.10). Conclusions: Electrographic seizures and electrographic status epilepticus are common in children with abusive head trauma. Most seizures have no clinical correlate. Further study is needed to determine whether seizure identification and management improves outcome. (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2013; 14:709-715).

AB  - In transparent orthographies, like German, children with developmental dyslexia (DD) are mainly characterized by a reading fluency deficit. The reading fluency deficit might be traced back to a scarce integration of orthographic and phonological representations. In order to address this question, the present study used EEG to investigate the N300, an ERP component which has been associated with the integration of orthographic and phonological representations. Twenty children without DD and 18 children with DD performed a phonological (P)-orthographic (O) matching task (P-O condition), which tapped the integration of orthographic and phonological representations. A control task was applied which did not require the integration of orthographic and phonological representations and consisted only of orthographic information (O-O condition). The O-O condition revealed a similar N300 distribution between groups with a bilateral activity over fronto-temporal electrodes. However, in the P-O condition N300 differentiated the 2 groups of children. The control group revealed greater activity over left fronto-temporal electrodes, whereas the N300 was distributed bilaterally in the group of children with DD suggesting deficient integration of orthographic and phonological representations. These findings might be related to the reading fluency deficit as it was also observed that better reading fluency was correlated with higher (r= -36) and earlier peaking (r= -33) N300 amplitudes in the left hemisphere and attenuated N300 amplitudes (r= .45) in the right hemisphere. Standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (sLORETA) revealed that children with DD rely more on right temporo-parietal brain areas compared to children without DD. Furthermore, in order to rule out that earlier deficient processes might influence the group differences found in the N300, we analyzed the N170 for group differences. We did not find significant differences between children without DD and children with DD. In conclusion the results suggest deficient integration of orthographic and phonological representations in dyslexia, as indexed by the N300, and further highlight how this activity is relevant for fluent reading. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Annotation: Development of facial expression recognition from childhood to adolescence: Behavioural and neurological perspectives
AU  - Herba, C.

T2  - Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines
AB  - Background: Intact emotion processing is critical for normal emotional development. Recent advances in neuroimaging have facilitated the examination of brain development, and have allowed for the exploration of the relationships between the development of emotion processing abilities, and that of associated neural systems. Methods: A literature review was performed of published studies examining the development of emotion expression recognition in normal children and psychiatric populations, and of the development of neural systems important for emotion processing. Results: Few studies have explored the development of emotion expression recognition throughout childhood and adolescence. Behavioural studies suggest continued development throughout childhood and adolescence (reflected by accuracy scores and speed of processing), which varies according to the category of emotion displayed. Factors such as sex, socio-economic status, and verbal ability may also affect this development. Functional neuroimaging studies in adults highlight the role of the amygdala in emotion processing. Results of the few neuroimaging studies in children have focused on the role of the amygdala in the recognition of fearful expressions. Although results are inconsistent, they provide evidence throughout childhood and adolescence for the continued development of and sex differences in amygdalar function in response to fearful expressions. Studies exploring emotion expression recognition in psychiatric populations of children and adolescents suggest deficits that are specific to the type of disorder and to the emotion displayed. Conclusions: Results from behavioural and neuroimaging studies indicate continued development of emotion expression recognition and neural regions important for this process throughout childhood and adolescence. Methodological inconsistencies and disparate findings make any conclusion difficult, however. Further studies are required examining the relationship between the development of emotion expression recognition and that of underlying neural systems, in particular subcortical and prefrontal cortical structures. These will inform understanding of the neural bases of normal and abnormal emotional development, and aid the development of earlier interventions for children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders. © Association for Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2004.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using positron emission tomography (PET) during overt word and nonword reading tasks to determine structures involved in semantic processing. Ten young, healthy, right-handed subjects were scanned 12 times, twice in each of six specific conditions. Blood flow was measured by 15O- water using standard PET imaging technology. The rCBFs during different cognitive conditions were compared by using analysis of covariance (SPM94), which resulted in three-dimensional maps of those brain regions more active in one condition relative to another. When the subjects read aloud words with difficult or unusual graphemephoneme translations (i.e., third-order approximation to English or irregularly spelled real words), increases in activation were seen in the inferior frontal cortex. When subjects were reading aloud regular and irregular words (which had important semantic components relative to nonwords), activation of the fusiform gyrus was seen. These data are broadly consistent with brain regions generally associated with reading based on other neuropsychological paradigms, and they emphasize the multicomponent aspects of this complex cognitive process.

AB  - Story listening in children relies on brain regions supporting speech perception, auditory word recognition, syntax, semantics, and discourse abilities, along with the ability to attend and process information (part of executive functions). Speed-of-processing is an early-developed executive function. We used functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate the relationship between story listening and speed-of-processing in preschool-age children. Eighteen participants performed story-listening tasks during MRI scans. Functional and structural connectivity analysis was performed using the speed-of-processing scores as regressors. Activation in the superior frontal gyrus during story listening positively correlated with speed-of-processing scores. This region was functionally connected with the superior temporal gyrus, insula, and hippocampus. Fractional anisotropy in the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, which connects the superior frontal and temporal gyri, was positively correlated with speed-of-processing scores. Our results suggest that speed-of-processing skills in preschool-age children are reflected in functional activation and connectivity during story listening and may act as a biomarker for future academic abilities. ©2017 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.

AU  - Uyeki, T.M.

T2  - Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society
AB  - Encephalopathy is an important complication associated with influenza, most frequently observed in young children, with a wide range of severity. The most severe category of influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE) is acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), characterized by high frequency of neurologic sequelae and fatal outcomes. We report two young siblings who developed fever and seizures with altered mental status. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection was identified in upper respiratory tract specimens from both patients, and neuroimaging revealed bilateral inflammatory lesions, consistent with acute necrotizing encephalopathy. Neither child had received influenza vaccination. Both children progressed to critical illness and required invasive mechanical ventilation. In addition to critical care management, both patients received high-dose corticosteroids, mannitol, anticonvulsants, and antiviral treatment of influenza. The older child recovered fully and was discharged 2 weeks after illness onset, but the younger sibling developed severe brainstem edema and cerebellar tonsillar herniation, and died on illness day 11. Both children tested positive for Ran Binding Protein 2 (RANBP2) gene mutations. RANBP2 is a genetic polymorphism associated with recurrent episodes of necrotizing encephalitis with respiratory viral infections. Annual influenza vaccination is especially important for ANE survivors, with or without RANBP2 mutations, their household contacts, and caregivers. During influenza season, close monitoring of any child with a history of neurological complications associated with respiratory illness is indicated, with prompt initiation of antiviral treatment with onset of acute respiratory illness, and influenza testing performed by molecular assay.

T2  - Neuropsychologia
AB  - During reading, dyslexic readers exhibit more and longer fixations and a higher percentage of regressions than normal readers. It is still a matter of debate, whether these divergent eye movement patterns of dyslexic readers reflect an underlying problem in word processing or whether they are - as the proponents of the magnocellular deficit hypothesis claim - associated with deficient visual perception that is causal for dyslexia. To overcome problems in the empirical linkage of the magnocellular theory with reading, a string processing task is presented that poses similar demands on visual perception (in terms of letter identification) and oculomotor control as reading does. Two experiments revealed no differences in the eye movement patterns of dyslexic and control readers performing this task. Furthermore, no relationship between the functionality of the participants' magnocellular system assessed by the coherent motion task and string processing were found. The perceptual and oculomotor demands required during string processing were functionally equivalent to those during reading and the presented consonant strings had similar visual characteristics as reading material. Thus, a strong inference can be drawn: Dyslexic readers do not seem to have difficulties with the accurate perception of letters and the control of their eye movements during reading - their reading difficulties therefore cannot be explained in terms of oculomotor and visuo-perceptual problems. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural activation during a semantic-classification/object- recognition task in 13 persons with Down syndrome and 12 typically developing control participants (age range 5 12-26 years). A comparison between groups suggested atypical patterns of brain activation for the individuals with Down syndrome. Correlation analyses between an index of visual spatial ability and brain activation depicted a positive relationship between (a) this index and brain activation in regions of the occipital and parietal lobes for the typically developing individuals and (b) the middle and dorsal frontal gyri in the individuals with Down syndrome. These findings supported the authors' hypothesis that persons with Down syndrome demonstrate atypical neural activation compared with typically developing individuals matched for chronological age. © American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.

TI  - Expert individuation of objects increases activation in the fusiform face area of children
AU  - James, T.W.
AU  - James, K.H.
T2  - NeuroImage
AB  - The role of experience in the development of brain mechanisms for face recognition is intensely debated. Experience with subordinate- and individual-level classification of faces is thought, by some, to be foundational in the development of the specialization of face recognition. Studying children with extremely intense interests (EII) provides an opportunity to examine experience-related changes in non-face object recognition in a population where face expertise is not fully developed. Here, two groups of school-aged children -one group with an EII with Pokémon cards and another group of age-matched controls - underwent fMRI while viewing faces, Pokémon characters, Pokémon objects, and Digimon characters. Pokémon objects were non-character Pokémon cards that experts do not typically individuate during game play and trading. Neither experts nor controls had previous experience with Digimon characters. As expected, experts and controls showed equivalent activation in the fusiform face area (FFA) with face stimuli. As predicted by the expertise hypothesis, experts showed greater activation than controls with Pokémon characters, and showed greater activation with Pokémon characters than Pokémon objects. Experts and controls showed equivalent activation with Digimon characters. However, heightened activation with Digimon characters in both groups suggested that there are other strong influences on the activation of the FFA beyond stimulus characteristics, experience, and classification level. By demonstrating the important role of expertise, the findings are inconsistent with a purely face-specific account of FFA function. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the effects of expertise and categorization level on activation in the FFA in a group of typically developing children. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Dyslexia is characterized by a core phonological deficit, although recent studies indicate that semantic impairment also contributes to this condition. In this study, event-related potentials (ERP) were used to examine whether the N400 wave in dyslexic children is modulated by phonological or semantic priming, similarly to age-matched controls. ERPs were recorded while children listened to word lists in which the semantic and phonological congruency of the terminal words were manipulated. No overt judgments were made by participants. In control children the N400 amplitude to both semantically and phonologically incongruent words was enlarged relative to congruent words. Dyslexic children exhibited a dissociation of priming effects depending on whether semantic or phonological primes were used. Semantic priming elicited an N400 effect comparable to controls, though delayed. In phonological priming, the dyslexics differed from controls in both the phonologically incongruent and congruent conditions showing reduced N400 amplitude in the former and enhanced N400 in the latter. This pattern suggests that when faced with phonological priming, dyslexics show abnormal neural responses related to both integration of similarities between the consecutive stimuli and the ability to detect incongruent stimuli. Semantic priming seems relatively intact in dyslexics, however neural responses to contextual incongruency are delayed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Musical training modulates the development of syntax processing in children
AU  - Jentschke, S.

T2  - NeuroImage
AB  - The question of how musical training can influence perceptual and cognitive abilities of children has been the subject of numerous past studies. However, evidence showing which neural mechanisms underlie changes in cognitive skills in another domain following musical training has remained sparse. Syntax processing in language and music has been shown to rely on overlapping neural resources, and this study compared the neural correlates of language- and music-syntactic processing between children with and without long-term musical training. Musically trained children had larger amplitudes of the ERAN (early right anterior negativity), elicited by music-syntactic irregularities. Furthermore, the ELAN (early left anterior negativity), a neurophysiological marker of syntax processing in language, was more strongly developed in these children, and they furthermore had an enlarged amplitude of a later negativity, assumed to reflect more sustained syntax processing. Thus, our data suggest that the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying syntax processing in music and language are developed earlier, and more strongly, in children with musical training. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cavernous hemangioma is increasingly recognized as the cause of epilepsy attributed to vasogenic foci. The clinical picture of this lesion is notable for epileptic seizures and intracerebral hemorrhage. Surgical excision of cavernoma remains the most effective antiepileptic modality. Good results of surgery are achieved with the use of modern operative procedures such as stereotaxy and neuronavigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve patients with cavernous hemangioma were operated at the Department of Neurosurgery and Pediatric Neurosurgery, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, between 1999 and 2008. This group included 10 females aged 7-54 years (mean 24.8 years) and 2 males aged 14-49 years (mean 31.5 years), 7 children (58.3%) and 5 adults (41.7%). Seven patients (58.3%) presented with generalized and the remaining 5 patients (41.7%) with secondarily generalized seizures. The mean time from onset of seizures to surgery was 2.6 months. All patients were operated using preoperative neuronavigated mapping to determine the optimal access to the lesion followed by neuronavigation-guided cavernoma excision. Postoperative neurological status was assessed with GOS scale and antiepileptic treatment outcome with Engel's scale as modified by Moran. RESULTS: The caveroma was completely removed in each case. Postoperative follow-up time was 2-59 months (mean 30.3 months). Neurological status of all patients was category 5 of the GOS scale. Engel's class I outcome was achieved in all patients. Nine patients (75%) were weaned off antiepileptic drugs following normalization of EEG. CONCLUSIONS: The following conclusions were drawn basing on the findings of this study: (1) Neuronavigation offers high precision and low traumatization which reduce the risk of neurological sequellae (neurological deficits and epilepsy) in patients operated for cavernoma; (2) Early resection of cavernoma offers the chance of curing epilepsy.

AB  - The results from studies using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in adults have largely revealed the involvement of left-hemisphere perisylvian areas in the reading process, including extrastriate visual cortex, inferior parietal regions, superior temporal gyrus, and inferior frontal cortex. Although the recruitment of these regions varies with the particular reading-related task, general networks of regions seem to be uniquely associated with different components of the reading process. For example, visual word form processing is associated with occipital and occipitotemporal sites, whereas reading-relevant phonological processing has been associated with superior temporal, occipitotemporal and inferior frontal sites of the left hemisphere. Such findings are evaluated in light of the technical and experimental limitations encountered in functional brain imaging studies, and the implications for pediatric studies are discussed.

AB  - Object. The aim of this study was to estimate the accuracy of routine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies in the classification of brain tumors in terms of both cell type and grade of malignancy. Methods. The authors retrospectively assessed the correlation between neuroimaging classifications and histopathological diagnoses by using multicenter database records from 393 patients with brain tumors. An ontology was devised to establish diagnostic agreement. Each tumor category was compared with the corresponding histopathological diagnoses by dichotomization. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPVs and NPVs, respectively), and the Wilson 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each were calculated. In routine reporting of MR imaging examinations, tumor types and grades were classified with a high specificity (85.2-100%); sensitivity varied, depending on the tumor type and grade, alone or in combination. The recognition of broad diagnostic categories (neuroepithelial or meningeal lesions) was highly sensitive, whereas when both detailed type and grade were considered, sensitivity diverged, being highest in low-grade meningioma (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 96.2-100.0%) and lowest in high-grade meningioma (sensitivity 0.0%, 95% CI 0.0-65.8%) and low-grade oligodendroglioma (sensitivity 15%, 95% CI 5.2-36.0%). In neuroepithelial tumors, sensitivity was inversely related to the precision in reporting of grade and cellular origin; "glioma" was a frequent neuroimaging classification associated with higher sensitivity in the corresponding category. The PPVs varied among categories, in general being greater than their prevalence in this dataset. The NPV was high in all categories (69.8-100%). Conclusions. The PPVs and NPVs provided in this study may be used as estimates of posttest probabilities of diagnostic accuracy using MR imaging. This study targets the need for noninvasively increasing sensitivity in categorizing most brain tumor types while retaining high specificity, especially in the differentiation of high- and low-grade glial tumor classes.

AB  - Around their first birthday infants begin to talk, yet they comprehend words long before. This study investigated the event-related potentials (ERP) responses of nine-month-olds on basic level picture-word pairings. After a familiarization phase of six picture-word pairings per semantic category, comprehension for novel exemplars was tested in a picture-word matching paradigm. ERPs time-locked to pictures elicited a modulation of the Negative Central (Nc) component, associated with visual attention and recognition. It was attenuated by category repetition as well as by the type-token ratio of picture context. ERPs time-locked to words in the training phase became more negative with repetition (N300-600), but there was no influence of picture type-token ratio, suggesting that infants have identified the concept of each picture before a word was presented. Results from the test phase provided clear support that infants integrated word meanings with (novel) picture context. Here, infants showed different ERP responses for words that did or did not align with the picture context: a phonological mismatch (N200) and a semantic mismatch (N400). Together, results were informative of visual categorization, word recognition and word-to-world-mappings, all three crucial processes for vocabulary construction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Auditory naming is suggested to require verbal working memory (WM) operations in addition to speech sound perception during the sentence listening period and semantic/syntactic processing during the subsequent judgement period. We attempted to dissect cortical activations attributable to verbal WM from those otherwise involved in answering auditory sentence questions. We studied 19 patients who underwent electrocorticography recordings and measured high-gamma activity during auditory naming and WM tasks. In the auditory naming task, inferior-precentral high-gamma activity was augmented during sentence listening, and the magnitude of augmentation was independently correlated to that during the WM task maintenance period as well as patient age. High-gamma augmentation during the WM task scanning period accounted for high-gamma variance during the naming task judgement period in some of the left frontal association neocortex regions (most significantly in the middle-frontal, less in the inferior-frontal, and least in the orbitofrontal gyrus). Inferior-frontal high-gamma augmentation was left-hemispheric dominant during naming task judgement but rather symmetric during WM scanning. Left orbitofrontal high-gamma augmentation was evident only during the naming task judgement period but minimal during the WM task scanning period. The inferior-precentral regions may exert WM maintenance during sentence listening, and such maintenance function may be gradually strengthened as the brain matures. The left frontal association neocortex may have a dorsal-to-ventral gradient in functional roles during naming task judgement. Namely, left middle-frontal activation may be well-attributable to WM scanning function, whereas left orbitofrontal activation may be attributable less to WM scanning but more largely to syntactic/semantic processing. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - We report three children, each of whom seemed to have a primary mitochondrial disorder at presentation but was eventually diagnosed with an extramitochondrial inherited metabolic disease. The first patient presented at 6 months with developmental delay. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an abnormal signal in the white matter, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed elevated lactate peaks. A muscle biopsy showed complex IV deficiency, but leukocyte measurement of galactosylceramide β-galactosidase activity was markedly diminished, consistent with Krabbe's disease. The second patient presented at birth with seizures and later had developmental delays. There was brain atrophy on neuroimaging. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels were elevated. She had persistently elevated urine thiosulfate, which was diagnostic for molybdenum cofactor deficiency. The third child presented at 2 months with seizures and hypotonia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an abnormal signal in the basal ganglia and surrounding white matter, whereas magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed elevated lactate peaks. A brain biopsy was diagnostic for Alexander's disease. These cases and others in the literature suggest that lactic acid elevation in the central nervous system can be found in a number of extramitochondrial neurologic diseases. Such diseases would constitute a third category of lactic acidosis.

AB  - Aspartate–glutamate carrier 1 (AGC1) is one of two exchangers within the malate-aspartate shuttle. AGC1 is encoded by the SLC25A12 gene. Three patients with pathogenic variants in SLC25A12 have been reported in the literature. These patients were clinically characterized by neurodevelopmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, cerebral atrophy, and hypomyelination; however, there has been discussion in the literature as to whether this hypomyelination is primary or secondary to a neuronal defect. Here we report a 12-year-old patient with variants in SLC25A12 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at multiple ages. Novel compound heterozygous, recessive variants in SLC25A12 were identified: c.1295C'T (p.A432V) and c.1447-2_1447-1delAG. Clinical presentation is characterized by severe intellectual disability, nonambulatory, nonverbal status, hypotonia, epilepsy, spastic quadriplegia, and a happy disposition. The serial neuroimaging findings are notable for cerebral atrophy with white matter involvement, namely, early hypomyelination yet subsequent progression of myelination. The longitudinal MRI findings are most consistent with a leukodystrophy of the leuko-axonopathy category, that is, white matter abnormalities that are most suggestive of mechanisms that result from primary neuronal defects. We present here the first case of a patient with compound heterozygous variants in SLC25A12, including brain MRI findings, in the oldest individual reported to date with this neurogenetic condition. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ERPs to auditory stimuli, generated during an oddball task, were obtained in a group of autistic children and three control groups (normal, ADDH, and dyslectic children, respectively). The task included the presentation of standards, deviants, and novels and had a (between-group) passive vs. active (counting) condition. It was examined whether 1) it was possible to replicate several earlier findings, 2) autistics manifest an abnormal lateralization pattern of ERPs, 3) autistics have an abnormal mismatch negativity (MMN), and 4) differences between autistics and normals are really specific to the autistic group. The only finding that could be replicated was that autistics have a smaller A/Pcz/300. There was no evidence for abnormal lateralization or abnormal MMN; however, there was an unexpected effect of the task manipulation on the amplitude of the P3: in autistics, the occipital P3 to deviant stimuli was significantly larger in the active than in the passive condition, a finding, like the replication of the smaller A/Pcz/300, specific to the autistic group. It was suggested that the auditory occipital task effect is related to understimulation of the occipital lobe by visual stimuli in autistic children. © 1995 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB  - Objective: Contrasts of verbal fluency and automatic speech provide an opportunity to evaluate the neural underpinnings of generativity and flexibility in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Method: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to contrast brain activity in high functioning ASD (n=17, mean verbal IQ=117) and neurotypical (NT; n=20, mean verbal IQ=112) adolescent and young adult males (12-23. years). Participants responded to three word generation conditions: automatic speech (reciting months), category fluency, and letter fluency. Results: Our paradigm closely mirrored behavioral fluency tasks by requiring overt, free recall word generation while controlling for differences in verbal output between the groups and systematically increasing the task demand. The ASD group showed reduced neural response compared to the NT participants during fluency tasks in multiple regions of left anterior and posterior cortices, and sub-cortical structures. Six of these regions fell in cortico-striatal circuits previously linked to repetitive behaviors (Langen, Durston, Kas, van Engeland, & Staal, 2011), and activity in two of them (putamen and thalamus) was negatively correlated with autism repetitive behavior symptoms in the ASD group. In addition, response in left inferior frontal gyrus was differentially modulated in the ASD, relative to the NT, group as a function of task demand. Conclusions: These data indicate a specific, atypical brain response in ASD to demanding generativity tasks that may have relevance to repetitive behavior symptoms in ASD as well as to difficulties generating original verbal responses. © 2013.

AB  - Tools represent a special class of objects, because they are processed across both the dorsal and ventral visual object processing pathways. Three core regions are known to be involved in tool processing: the left posterior middle temporal gyrus, the medial fusiform gyrus (bilaterally), and the left inferior parietal lobule. A critical and relatively unexplored issue concerns whether, in development, tool preferences emerge at the same time and to a similar degree across all regions of the tool-processing network. To test this issue, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the neural amplitude, peak location, and the dispersion of tool-related neural responses in the youngest sample of children tested to date in this domain (ages 4-8 years).We showthat children recruit overlapping regions of the adult tool-processing network and also exhibit similar patterns of co-activation across the network to adults. The amplitude and co-activation data showthat the core components of the toolprocessing network are established by age 4. Our findings on the distributions of peak location and dispersion of activation indicate that the tool network undergoes refinement between ages 4 and 8 years. © The Author 2016.

AB  - The aim of this study was to find the most prominent source of intersubject variability in neuronal activation for reading familiar words aloud. To this end, we collected functional imaging data from a large sample of subjects (n = 76) with different demographic characteristics such as handedness, sex, and age, while reading. The subject-by-subject error variance was estimated from a one-sample t test (on all 76 subjects) and was reduced to a lower dimension using principal components decomposition. A Gaussian Mixture Model was then applied to dissociate different subgroups of subjects that explained the main sources of variability in the data. This resulted in the identification of four different subject groups. The comparison of these subgroups to the subjects' demographic details showed that age had a significant effect on the subject partitioning. In addition, a region-by-group dissociation in the dorsal and the ventral inferior frontal cortex was consistent with previously reported dissociations in semantic and nonsemantic reading strategies. In contrast to these significant findings, the groupings did not differentiate subjects on the basis of either sex or handedness, nor did they segregate the subjects with right- versus leftlateralized reading activation. We therefore conclude that, of the variables tested, age and reading strategy were the most prominent source of variability in activation for reading familiar words aloud. © 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

T2  - Neuroimaging Clinics of North America
AB  - A curvature abnormality may be the initial or major presenting feature in a child with disease of the spinal column or spinal neuraxis. A simplified classification of common spinal curvature abnormalities of childhood include idiopathic, congenital/dysraphic, skeletal dysplasia, neurofibromatosis, and painful. The great majority of childhood scoliosis falls into the idiopathic category. Atypical clinical or radiographic features in a presumed idiopathic scoliosis may indicate an otherwise occult tumor or hydrosyringomyelia, or may be a consequence of increasing curvature with disk protrusion, nerve impingement, or cord attenuation. Neuroimaging beyond plain films is commonly necessary for atypical idiopathic scoliosis and for the other categories of scoliosis listed.

AB  - Febrile seizures (FS) are assumed to not have adverse long-term effects on cognitive development. Nevertheless, FS are often associated with hippocampal sclerosis which can imply episodic memory deficits. This interrelation has hardly been studied so far. In the current study 13 children who had suffered from FS during infancy and 14 control children (7-9 years old) were examined for episodic and semantic memory with standardized neuropsychological tests. Furthermore, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we studied neuronal activation while the children performed a continuous recognition memory task. The analysis of the behavioral data of the neuropsychological tests and the recognition memory experiment did not reveal any between group differences in memory performance. Consistent with other studies fMRI revealed repetition enhancement effects for both groups in a variety of brain regions (e.g. right middle frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus) and a repetition suppression effect in the right superior temporal gyrus. Different neural activation patterns between both groups were obtained selectively within the right supramarginal gyrus (BA 40). In the control group correct rejections of new items (CRs) were associated with stronger activation than correctly identified old items (HITs) whereas in the FS group no difference occurred. On the background that the right supramarginal gyrus is assumed to mediate a top-down process to internally direct attention towards recollected information, the results could indicate that control children used strategic recollection in order to reject new items (recall-to-reject). In contrast, the missing effect in the FS group could reflect a lack of strategy use, possibly due to impaired recollective processing. This study demonstrates that FS, even with mainly benign courses, can be accompanied by selective modifications in the neural structures underlying recognition memory. © 2012 Kipp, Opitz, Becker, Hofmann, Krick, Gortner and Mecklinger.

AB  - Background Management decisions and parental counseling after pediatric cardiac arrest depend on the ability of physicians to make accurate and timely predictions regarding neurological recovery. We evaluated neurologists and intensivists performing neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest to determine prediction agreement, accuracy, and confidence.
Methods Pediatric neurologists (n = 10) and intensivists (n = 9) reviewed 18 cases of children successfully resuscitated from a cardiac arrest and managed in the pediatric intensive care unit. Cases were sequentially presented (after arrest day 1, days 2-4, and days 5-7), with updated examinations, neurophysiologic data, and neuroimaging data. At each time period, physicians predicted outcome by Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category and specified prediction confidence.
Results Predicted discharge Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category versus actual hospital discharge Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category outcomes were compared. Exact (Predicted Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category - Actual Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category = 0) and close (Predicted Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category - Actual Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category = ±1) outcome prediction accuracies for all physicians improved over successive periods (P < 0.05). Prediction accuracy did not differ significantly between physician groups at any period or overall. Agreement improved over time among neurologists (day 1 Kappa [κ], 0.28; days 2-4 κ, 0.43; days 5-7 κ, 0.68) and among intensivists (day 1 κ, 0.30; days 2-4 κ, 0.44; days 5-7 κ, 0.57). Prediction confidence increased over time (P < 0.001) and did not differ between physician groups.
Conclusions Inter-rater agreement among neurologists and among intensivists improved over time and reached moderate levels. For all physicians, prediction accuracy and confidence improved over time. Further prospective research is needed to better characterize how physicians objectively and subjectively estimate neurological recovery after acute brain injury. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by language and communication impairments, social impairments, and repetitive behaviors or restricted interests. Previous studies of semantic functions have found differences in semantic processing and differences in the activation of the language network in adults with ASD compared to controls. The goal of this study is to examine semantic functions in adolescents with ASD compared to typically developing adolescents. We utilized fMRI with a reading version of a response-naming task to investigate activation in 12 right-handed adolescent boys with ASD and 12 typically developing boys. Both groups performed the task at ceiling levels. Boys with ASD had significantly stronger activation than controls in Broca's area, which was less left lateralized in ASD individuals. Controls had a significant correlation between frontal and temporal language area activation in the left hemisphere, whereas ASD adolescents did not. Direct group comparisons revealed additional regions activated in the ASD group relative to the control group. These results suggest differences in semantic organization, approaches to the semantic task, or efficiency in semantic processing in ASD adolescents relative to typically developing adolescents. © 2008 INS.

AB  - MRI is the preferred modality to investigate seizure as diagnostic yield is higher and more specific due to its varied applications. Total of 160 brain MR images of patients suffering from seizure during one year period was evaluated. All seizure cases underwent specific protocol for imaging that targeted hippocampal/mesial temporal lobe imaging. A cross sectional study of 160 MRI brain images was performed in patients with the main complaint of seizure within one-year period. The percentage distribution of abnormalities was calculated separately for pediatric and adult groups with Excel software. The total diagnostic yield of abnormal cases ranged from 53% to 55%. In pediatric group major abnormalities found were hippocampal sclerosis 4 (21%) 'T2 hyperintense foci in various distributions' 4 (21%), and cortical atrophy 4 (21%) where as major abnormalities found in adults were space occupying lesions 19 (27%), ischemia/infarcts 11 (16.2%), granulomatous lesions 8 (11%). Lesions that are better detected in MRI include hippocampal sclerosis and T2 hyperintensities that form the bulk of abnormalities in the pediatric category. Majority of abnormalities in the adult category like space occupying lesions can be easily picked up by CT whereas refractory seizure, cases with EEG findings suggesting TLE, suspected stroke should preferably undergo MRI brain imaging as it is much more sensitive in detecting these pathological substrates.

AB  - Objective: We determined where and when category-preferential augmentation of gamma activity took place during naming of animal or non-animal pictures. Methods: We studied 41 patients with focal epilepsy who underwent measurement of naming-related gamma-augmentation at 50-120. Hz during extraoperative electrocorticography. The assigned task consisted of naming of a visually-presented object classified as either 'animal' or 'non-animal'. Results: Within 80. ms following the onset of picture presentation, regardless of stimulus type, gamma-activity in bilateral occipital regions began to be augmented compared to the resting period. Initially in the occipital poles (at 140. ms and after) and subsequently in the lateral, inferior and medial occipital regions (at 320. ms and after), the degree of gamma-augmentation elicited by 'animal naming' became larger (by up to 52%) than that by 'non-animal naming'. Immediately prior to the overt response, left inferior frontal gamma-augmentation became modestly larger during 'animal naming' compared to 'non-animal naming'. Conclusions: Animal category-preferential gamma-augmentation sequentially involved the lower- and higher-order visual areas. Relatively larger occipital gamma-augmentation during 'animal naming' can be attributed to the more attentive analysis of animal stimuli including the face. Animal-preferential gamma-augmentation in the left inferior frontal region could be attributed to a need for selective semantic retrieval during 'animal naming'. Significance: A specific program of cortical processing to distinguish an animal (or face) from other objects might be initiated in the lower-order visual cortex. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

TI  - Dysmyelinating and demyelinating conditions in infancy
AU  - Kolodny, E.H.
T2  - Current Opinion in Neurology and Neurosurgery
AB  - The myelin membrane is essential for rapid conduction of nerve impulses through the central nervous system. Failure of myelination - dysmyelination - may arise through several mechanisms. The synthesis of a particular myelin protein can be defective, as occurs for proteolipid protein in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease and for myelin basic protein in the 18q- syndrome. Delay in myelination with a more generalized diminution in white matter is characteristic of many inherited metabolic diseases, including galactosemia, pyridoxine-dependent seizure disorder, glutaric aciduria type 1, and infantile Refsum disease. Demyelination or breakdown in myelin is characteristic of metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, mitochondrial disorders, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, Alexander disease, and orthochromatic leukodystrophy. A fourth category is reserved for malformation syndromes. These include Cockayne, Fukuyama, Walker-Warburg, and Angelman syndromes. Demyelination also occurs in HIV-infected individuals with central nervous system findings and in multiple sclerosis. Much of the evidence for leukodystrophy in these disorders comes from neuroimaging. Some of these disorders are treatable.

AB  - The severity of intellectual sequelae and prognosis varies in patients with congenital ocular motor apraxia (COMA). Here, we explored this phenomenon with regard to the accompanying oculomotor signs and gross motor development, as well as the subtentorial structure defects. Ten patients diagnosed with COMA (M:F = 4:6, 4-37 years old) were reviewed. Four individuals who gained the ability to walk at 2 years or earlier showed normal intellect and social skills. Those who walked later often showed accompanying intellectual (5/6) and speech (6/6) disabilities. In this latter group, atypical oculomotor signs for COMA (presence of nystagmus, mild limitation of vertical gaze, slower head thrust, and marked improvement of lateral saccade during early childhood) were often noted (4/6). Minor anomalies of fingers and toes were also common in this group. Neuroimaging was conduced in nine patients (pneumoencepharography 1; computed tomography: 8, magnetic resonance imaging: 2). Dilatation of the fourth ventricle, mainly at the level of the midbrain or upper pons (n = 7), and hypoplastic cerebellar vermis (n = 6) were commonly observed in both the early- and late-walking groups. 'Molar tooth' signs (n = 3) were exclusively noted in the late-walking group, and often accompanied by atypical oculomotor signs (3/3) and intellectual disabilities (2/3). Vermian hypoplasia and dilatation of the fourth ventricle at the upper brainstem level in COMA patients, with or without intellectual disabilities, suggested that the cardinal lesion for OMA may exist in these areas. The presence of a subset of 'atypical' COMA patients may suggest that COMA with subtle infratentorial abnormality represents a heterogeneous disease category, showing similar oculomotor disturbance. This review indicated that clinical and neuroradiological inspection might be valuable for prediction of long-term intellectual prognosis in COMA patients. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study examined language comprehension in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in light of monitoring. It was studied whether individuals with ASD monitor their language perception, and whether monitoring during language perception could be modulated with instructions. We presented higher-level (semantic) linguistic violations and lower-level (orthographic) linguistic violations in a free reading condition and in an instructed condition, recording event-related potentials. For control participants, a monitoring response as tapped by the P600 effect was found to semantically and orthographically incorrect input in both conditions. For participants with ASD, however, a monitoring response to semantically implausible input, tapped by the P600, was found only in the instructed condition. For orthographic errors monitoring was observed both in the free reading and in the instructed condition. This suggests that people with ASD are less inclined than typical individuals to monitor their perception of higher-level linguistic input, but that this can be enhanced with instructions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to compare the relationship between core executive functions and frontoparietal network connections at rest between children who had suffered an arterial ischemic stroke and typically developing peers. Methods Children diagnosed with arterial ischemic stroke more than two years previously and typically developing controls were included. Executive function (EF) measures comprised inhibition (Go-NoGo task), fluency (category fluency task), processing speed (processing speed tasks), divided attention, working memory (letter-number sequencing), conceptual reasoning (matrices) and EF in everyday life (questionnaire). High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) structural images and resting-state functional MR imaging were acquired. Independent component analysis was used to identify the frontoparietal network. Functional connections were obtained through correlation matrices; associations between cognitive measures and functional connections through Pearson's correlations. Results Twenty participants after stroke (7 females; mean age 16.0 years) and 22 controls (13 females; mean age 14.8 years) were examined. Patients and controls performed within the normal range in all executive tasks. Patients who had had a stroke performed significantly less well in tests of fluency, processing speed and conceptual reasoning than controls. Resting-state functional connectivity between the left and right inferior parietal lobe was significantly reduced in patients after pediatric stroke. Fluency, processing speed and perceptual reasoning correlated positively with the interhemispheric inferior parietal lobe connection in patients and controls. Conclusion Decreased interhemispheric connections after stroke in childhood may indicate a disruption of typical interhemispheric interactions relating to executive functions. The present results emphasize the relationship between functional organization of the brain at rest and cognitive processes. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The current study investigated the relevance of semantic processing and stimulus salience for memory performance in young ADHD patients and healthy control participants. 18 male ADHD patients and 15 healthy control children and adolescents participated in an ERP study during a visual memory paradigm with two different encoding tasks requiring either perceptual or semantic processing of neutral and emotional pictures. ADHD patients and healthy controls both showed a more negative slow-wave in response to task cues signalling semantic as compared to perceptual stimulus processing. In contrast to ADHD patients, healthy control children showed a larger increase in memory performance for deeply processed neutral pictures which was accompanied by a more positive mid-latency ERP component (so-called P300) after stimulus onset. Our results demonstrate that ADHD patients succeeded in allocating neural resources in preparation of different task demands. However, this increase in preparatory activation to the semantic task cue did not suffice to support successful processing and encoding of neutral stimuli to the same extent as in healthy controls. These findings provide evidence that ADHD patients show deficits in translating pre-stimulus mobilization of neural resources to successful memory formation in the absence of salient stimulus material. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Reading acquisition is one of the most complex and demanding learning processes faced by children in their first years of schooling. If reading acquisition is challenging in one language, how is it when reading is acquired simultaneously in two languages? What is the impact of bilingualism on the development of literacy? We review behavioral and neuroimaging evidence from alphabetic writing systems suggesting that early bilingualism modulates reading development. Particularly, we show that cross-linguistic variations and cross-linguistic transfer affect bilingual reading strategies as well as their cognitive underpinnings. We stress the fact that the impact of bilingualism on literacy acquisition depends on the specific combination of languages learned and does not manifest itself similarly across bilingual populations. We argue that these differences can be explained by variations due to orthographic depth in the grain sizes used to perform reading and reading-related tasks. Overall, we propose novel hypotheses to shed light on the behavioral and neural variability observed in reading skills among bilinguals. © 2017, Psychonomic Society, Inc.

AB  - Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated multimodal (visual and auditory) semantic and unimodal (visual only) phonological processing in reading disabled (RD) adolescents and non-impaired (NI) control participants. We found reduced activation for RD relative to NI in a number of left-hemisphere reading-related areas across all processing tasks regardless of task type (semantic vs. phonological) or modality (auditory vs. visual modality). Moreover, activation differences in these regions, which included the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus, and the occipitotemporal region, were largely independent of in-scanner performance in our auditory semantic task. That is, although RD participants and NI participants differed in performance in visually presented conditions, they did not differ significantly in the auditory condition, yet similar patterns of reduced activation were observed in these regions across conditions. These findings indicate a neurobiological marker in RD that is independent of task, modality, or performance. These findings are discussed in the context of current neurobiological models of RD. © 2009 The International Dyslexia Association.

T2  - Cerebral Cortex
AB  - Multiple studies have shown that individuals with a reading disability (RD) demonstrate deficits in posterior left-hemispheric brain regions during reading-related tasks. These studies mainly focused on reading sub-skills, and it remains debated whether such dysfunction is apparent during more ecologically valid reading skills, such as reading fluency. In this fMRI study, reading fluency was systematically varied to characterize neural correlates of reading fluency in 30 children with (RD) and without (typical developing children, TYP) a RD. Sentences were presented at constrained, comfortable, and accelerated speeds, which were determined based on individual reading speed. Behaviorally, RD children displayed decreased performance in several reading-related tasks. Using fMRI, we demonstrated that both TYP and RD children display increased activation in several components of the reading network during fluent reading. When required to read at an accelerated speed, RD children exhibited less activation in the fusiform gyrus (FG) compared with the TYP children. A region of interest analysis substantiated differences in the FG and demonstrated a relationship to behavioral reading performance. These results suggest that the FG plays a key role in fluent reading and that it can be modulated by speed. These results and their implications for remediation strategies should be considered in educational practice. © 2013 Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Patient lesion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have provided convincing evidence that a distributed brain network subserves word knowledge. However, little is known about the structural correlates of this network within the context of typical development and whether anatomical coupling in linguistically relevant regions of cortex varies as a function of vocabulary skill. Here we investigate the association between vocabulary and anatomical coupling in 235 typically developing youth (ages 6-19 years) using structural MRI. The study's primary aim was to evaluate whether higher vocabulary performance was associated with greater vertex-level cortical thickness covariation in distributed regions of cortex known to be associated with word knowledge. Results indicate that better vocabulary skills are associated with greater anatomical coupling in several linguistically relevant regions of cortex, including the left inferior parietal (temporal-parietal junction), inferior temporal, middle frontal, and superior frontal gyri and the right inferior frontal and precentral gyri. Furthermore, in high vocabulary scorers, stronger coupling is found among these regions. Thus, complementing patient and fMRI studies, this is the first investigation to highlight the relevance of anatomical covariance within the cortex to vocabulary skills in typically developing youth, further elucidating the distributed nature of neural systems subserving word knowledge. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Previous research has shown that left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) is a core node in the semantic network, and cross-sectional studies have shown that activation in this region changes developmentally and is related to skill measured concurrently. However, it is not known how functional connectivity with this region changes developmentally, and whether functional connectivity is related to future gains in reading. We conducted a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 30 typically developing children (aged 8–15) to examine whether initial brain measures, including activation and connectivity, can predict future behavioral improvement in a semantic judgment task. Participants were scanned on entering the study (time 1, T1) and a follow-up period of 2 years (time 2, T2). Character pairs were arranged in a continuous variable according to association strength (i.e. strong versus weak), and participants were asked to determine if these visually presented pairs were related in meaning. Our results demonstrated greater developmental changes from time 1 to time 2 for weaker association pairs in the left pMTG for the children (aged 8–11) as compared to the adolescents (aged 12–15). Moreover, the results showed greater developmental changes from time 1 to time 2 for weaker association pairs in connectivity between the pMTG and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) for the children as compared to the adolescents. Furthermore, a hierarchical stepwise regression model revealed that connectivity between the pMTG and IPL in weak association pairs was uniquely predictive of behavioral improvement from time 1 to time 2 for the children, but not the adolescents. Taken together, the activation results suggest relatively rapid development before adolescence of semantic representations in the pMTG. Moreover, the connectivity results of pMTG with IPL tentatively suggest that early development of semantic representations may be facilitated by enhanced engagement of phonological short-term memory. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

T2  - Neuropsychologia
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the developmental changes in a group of normally developing children (aged 8-12) and adolescents (aged 13-16) during semantic processing. We manipulated association strength (i.e. a global reading unit) and semantic radical (i.e. a local reading unit) to explore the interaction of lexical and sublexical semantic information in making semantic judgments. In the semantic judgment task, two types of stimuli were used: visually-similar (i.e. shared a semantic radical) versus visually-dissimilar (i.e. did not share a semantic radical) character pairs. Participants were asked to indicate if two Chinese characters, arranged according to association strength, were related in meaning. The results showed greater developmental increases in activation in left angular gyrus (BA 39) in the visually-similar compared to the visually-dissimilar pairs for the strong association. There were also greater age-related increases in angular gyrus for the strong compared to weak association in the visually-similar pairs. Both of these results suggest that shared semantics at the sublexical level facilitates the integration of overlapping features at the lexical level in older children. In addition, there was a larger developmental increase in left posterior middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) for the weak compared to strong association in the visually-dissimilar pairs, suggesting conflicting sublexical information placed greater demands on access to lexical representations in the older children. All together, these results suggest that older children are more sensitive to sublexical information when processing lexical representations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the neural correlates of semantic judgments to Chinese words in a group of 10-15 year old Chinese children. Two semantic tasks were used: visual-visual versus visual-auditory presentation. The first word was visually presented (i.e. character) and the second word was either visually or auditorily presented, and the participant had to determine if these two words were related in meaning. Different from English, Chinese has many homophones in which each spoken word corresponds to many characters. The visual-auditory task, therefore, required greater engagement of cognitive control for the participants to select a semantically appropriate answer for the second homophonic word. Weaker association pairs produced greater activation in the mid-ventral region of left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45) for both tasks. However, this effect was stronger for the visual-auditory task than for the visual-visual task and this difference was stronger for older compared to younger children. The findings suggest greater involvement of semantic selection mechanisms in the cross-modal task requiring the access of the appropriate meaning of homophonic spoken words, especially for older children. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To successfully interact with a rich and ambiguous visual environment, the human brain learns to differentiate visual stimuli and to produce the same response to subsets of these stimuli despite their physical difference. Although this visual categorization function is traditionally investigated from a unisensory perspective, its early development is inherently constrained by multisensory inputs. In particular, an early-maturing sensory system such as olfaction is ideally suited to support the immature visual system in infancy by providing stability and familiarity to a rapidly changing visual environment. Here, we test the hypothesis that rapid visual categorization of salient visual signals for the young infant brain, human faces, is shaped by another highly relevant human-related input from the olfactory system, the mother's body odor. We observe that a right-hemispheric neural signature of single-glance face categorization from natural images is significantly enhanced in the maternal versus a control odor context in individual 4-month-old infant brains. A lack of difference between odor conditions for the common brain response elicited by both face and non-face images rules out a mere enhancement of arousal or visual attention in the maternal odor context. These observations show that face-selective neural activity in infancy is mediated by the presence of a (maternal) body odor, providing strong support for multisensory inputs driving category acquisition in the developing human brain and having important implications for our understanding of human perceptual development. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Previous research on syntactic processing in L2 has mainly focused on how L2 speakers respond to "objective" syntactic violations, that is, phrases that are incorrect by native standards. In this study, we investigate how L2 learners, in particular those of less than near-native proficiency, process phrases that deviate from their own, "subjective," and often incorrect syntactic representations, that is, whether they use these subjective and idiosyncratic representations during sentence comprehension. We study this within the domain of grammatical gender in a population of German learners of Dutch, for which systematic errors of grammatical gender are well documented. These L2 learners as well as a control group of Dutch native speakers read Dutch sentences containing gender-marked determiner- noun phrases in which gender agreement was either (objectively) correct or incorrect. Furthermore, the noun targets were selected such that, in a high proportion of nouns, objective and subjective correctness would differ for German learners. The ERP results show a syntactic violation effect (P600) for objective gender agreement violations for native, but not for nonnative speakers. However, when the items were re-sorted for the L2 speakers according to subjective correctness (as assessed offline), the P600 effect emerged as well. Thus, rather than being insensitive to violations of gender agreement, L2 speakers are similarly sensitive as native speakers but base their sensitivity on their subjective- sometimes incorrect-representations. © 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Background: Impaired working memory is thought to be a core feature of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous imaging studies investigating working memory in ADHD have used tasks involving different cognitive resources and ignoring the categorical judgments about objects that are essential parts of performance in visual working memory tasks, thus complicating the interpretation of their findings. In the present study, we explored differential neural activation in children and adolescents with ADHD and in healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with the categorical n-back task (CN-BT), which maximized demands for executive reasoning while holding memory demands constant. Methods: A total of 33 drug-naive, right-handed male ADHD without comorbidity (mean age 9.9 ± 2.4. years) and 27 right-handed, healthy male controls (mean age 10.9 ± 2.7. years) were recruited in the present study. Event-related fMRI was used to study differences in brain activity during the CN-BT between the two groups. Results: The two groups did not differ in their accuracy in the CN-BT, although the ADHD patients showed significantly shorter reaction times to correct responses than did the controls. During the CN-BT, both ADHD patients and controls showed significant positive and negative activations by the correct responses, mainly in the sensory-motor pathways and the striato-cerebellum circuit. Additionally, the ADHD patients showed significantly higher activation in the bilateral globus pallidus and the right hippocampus compared with the controls. There was also a positive correlation between hyperactivation of the left globus pallidus and the reaction time to correct responses in ADHD. Conclusions: In contrast to controls, ADHD patients showed neural hyperactivation in the striatum and mediotemporal areas during a working memory task involving categorization. Hyperfunction in these areas might be the pathophysiological foundation of ADHD, related to the deficits of working memory and the impulsive symptoms. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

T2  - NeuroImage
AB  - Neuroimaging studies have identified a common network of brain regions involving the prefrontal and parietal cortices across a variety of working memory (WM) tasks. However, previous studies have also reported category-specific dissociations of activation within this network. In this study, we investigated the development of category-specific activation in a WM task with digits, letters, and faces. Eight-year-old children and adults performed a 2-back WM task while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Overall, children were significantly slower and less accurate than adults on all three WM conditions (digits, letters, and faces); however, within each age group, behavioral performance across the three conditions was very similar. FMRI results revealed category-specific activation in adults but not children in the intraparietal sulcus for the digit condition. Likewise, during the letter condition, category-specific activation was observed in adults but not children in the left occipital-temporal cortex. In contrast, children and adults showed highly similar brain-activity patterns in the lateral fusiform gyri when solving the 2-back WM task with face stimuli. Our results suggest that 8-year-old children do not yet engage the typical brain regions that have been associated with abstract or semantic processing of numerical symbols and letters when these processes are task-irrelevant and the primary task is demanding. Nevertheless, brain activity in letter-responsive areas predicted children's spelling performance underscoring the relationship between abstract processing of letters and linguistic abilities. Lastly, behavioral performance on the WM task was predictive of math and language abilities highlighting the connection between WM and other cognitive abilities in development. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The reading system can be broken down into four basic subcomponents in charge of prelexical, orthographic, phonological, and lexico-semantic processes. These processes need to jointly work together to become a fluent and efficient reader. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we systematically analyzed differences in neural activation patterns of these four basic subcomponents in children (N = 41, 9–13 years) using tasks specifically tapping each component (letter identification, orthographic decision, phonological decision, and semantic categorization). Regions of interest (ROI) were selected based on a meta-analysis of child reading and included the left ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOT), left posterior parietal cortex (PPC), left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA). Compared to a visual baseline task, enhanced activation in vOT and IFG was observed for all tasks with very little differences between tasks. Activity in the dorsal PPC system was confined to prelexical and phonological processing. Activity in the SMA was found in orthographic, phonological, and lexico-semantic tasks. Our results are consistent with the idea of an early engagement of the vOT accompanied by executive control functions in the frontal system, including the bilateral SMA. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Speech-related fMRI activation was examined in six hemispherectomy patients (three left LX, three right RX, four with congenital and two with late-acquired hemiplegia) operated in childhood for the relief of drug-resistant epilepsy. Although the temporal and sensorimotor pattern of activation was similar to that found in neurologically intact control participants, activation in Broca's area and its right homolog varied greatly. Involvement of pars triangularis and orbitalis was found in the three cases with best outcome (two RX, one LX), whereas pars opercularis alone was activated in the two remaining LX patients. The results suggest that distinct subregions of Broca's area and their right homologs can subserve speech and language, and that this variability may determine functional outcome. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective Acute necrotising encephalopathy (ANEC) is a severe, debilitating childhood disorder. We used the ANEC scoring system (ANE-ss) and standardised neurodevelopmental scores to objectively characterise medium and long term outcomes. Methods Retrospective review of children with ANEC at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, from 2005 to 2012. ANE-ss was determined from clinical features and neuroimaging, and neurodevelopmental scores (Pediatric Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended, Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scale and Pediatric Overall Performance Category scale) were applied at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months post diagnosis. Results Seven patients with ANEC were studied. All had a viral prodrome with fever, and encephalopathy at presentation, and received immunotherapy (steroids or immunoglobulin). ANE-ss scores were medium risk in 4 patients and high risk in 3 patients. One died (high risk ANE-ss) and outcome was determined in the 6 survivors. At 1 month post diagnosis, 3 patients (50%) were mildly affected and 3 (50%) were severely affected. Morbidity rates improved by 12 months, with 67% and 33.3% scoring in the mildly affected and severely affected ranges, respectively. Medium risk patients did well with majority having little or no neurological deficits and good outcome scores. Conclusion Mortality and severe morbidity correlated well with high risk ANE-ss. However, our patients with medium risk ANE-ss had good neurodevelopmental sequelae. Serial disability scoring is useful in evaluating the progress of ANEC patients on follow up. Assessment at 1 month post diagnosis can aid prognostication of long term outcome. © 2016 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology

T2  - Current Pain and Headache Reports
AB  - Post-traumatic headaches as well as post-traumatic syndrome can occur in patients after mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury. Most of the patients' symptoms clear within the first 3 to 6 months; however, there are no precise criteria for predicting the clinical outcome. The diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic headaches were defined by the International Headache Society in 2004 and are helpful for classification. Evaluation must be done on an individual basis, and patients who do not clear their symptoms may need neuroimaging. The headaches fall into the category of chronic tension-type headache as well as headaches compatible with migraine and are treated in a similar fashion. There is a small group of people who do not respond and have long-term problems. These patients may benefit from a combination of pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and neuropsychiatric treatment. Long-term studies are needed to help clarify the history of these patients. Copyright © 2007 by Current Medicine Group LLC.

AB  - The difficulty of visual recognition stems from the need to achieve high selectivity while maintaining robustness to object transformations within hundreds of milliseconds. Theories of visual recognition differ in whether the neuronal circuits invoke recurrent feedback connections or not. The timing of neurophysiological responses in visual cortex plays a key role in distinguishing between bottom-up and top-down theories. Here, we quantified at millisecond resolution the amount of visual information conveyed by intracranial field potentials from 912 electrodes in 11 human subjects. We could decode object category information from human visual cortex in single trials as early as 100 ms poststimulus. Decoding performance was robust to depth rotation and scale changes. The results suggest that physiological activity in the temporal lobe can account for key properties of visual recognition. The fast decoding in single trials is compatible with feedforward theories and provides strong constraints for computational models of human vision. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous behavioral studies have suggested that morphological awareness is impaired in Chinese children with reading disability (RD), but how this is reflected in brain alterations is not known. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the current study compared morphological processing in a RD group (11-13 years old) to an age-matched typically developing (TD) group. Participants made semantic relatedness judgments to incongruent word pairs that were either semantically related but did not share a morpheme or semantically unrelated but did share a morpheme. This was compared to conditions where semantic relatedness and morphemic information was congruent. A smaller incongruency effect was found in left dorsal posterior (BA9) and ventral anterior (BA47) inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the RD compared to the TD, suggesting that the RD is less sensitive to morphological information. This was a specific deficit as a phonological control task that manipulated congruency between orthography and phonology did not show group differences in the IFG. Moreover, brain activation in the IFG for the incongruency effect in the semantic task was negatively correlated with reading skill for the RD group only, suggesting that higher skill children with RD may rely on a compensatory whole-word strategy by ignoring the morphemic information. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dyslexia in alphabetic languages has been extensively investigated and suggests a central deficit in orthography to phonology mapping in the left hemisphere. Compared to dyslexia in alphabetic languages, the central deficit for Chinese dyslexia is still unclear. Because of the logographic nature of Chinese characters, some have suggested that Chinese dyslexia should have larger deficits in the semantic system. To investigate this, Chinese children with reading disability (RD) were compared to typically developing (TD) children using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on a rhyming judgment task and on a semantic association judgment task. RD children showed less activation for both tasks in right visual (BA18, 19) and left occipito-temporal cortex (BA 37), suggesting a deficit in visuo-orthographic processing. RD children also showed less activation for both tasks in left inferior frontal gyrus (BA44), which additionally showed significant correlations with activation of bilateral visuo-orthographic regions in the RD group, suggesting that the abnormalities in frontal cortex and in posterior visuo-orthographic regions may reflect a deficit in the connection between brain regions. Analyses failed to reveal larger differences between groups for the semantic compared to the rhyming task, suggesting that Chinese dyslexia is similarly impaired in the access to phonology and to semantics from the visual orthography. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The consequences of cortical resection, a treatment for humans with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy, provide a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of the nature and extent of cortical (re)organization. Despite the importance of visual processing in daily life, the neural and perceptual sequellae of occipitotemporal resections remain largely unexplored. Using psychophysical and fMRI investigations, we compared the neural and visuoperceptual profiles of 10 children or adolescents following unilateral cortical resections and their age- and gender-matched controls. Dramatically, with the exception of two individuals, both of whom had relatively greater cortical alterations, all patients showed normal perceptual performance on tasks of intermediate- and high-level vision, including face and object recognition. Consistently, again with the exception of the same two individuals, both univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses revealed normal selectivity and representational structure of category-selective regions. Furthermore, the spatial organization of category-selective regions obeyed the typical medial-to-lateral topographic organization albeit unilaterally in the structurally preserved hemisphere rather than bilaterally. These findings offer novel insights into the malleability of cortex in the pediatric population and suggest that, although experience may be necessary for the emergence of neural category-selectivity, this emergence is not necessarily contingent on the integrity of particular cortical structures.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT One approach to reduce seizure activity in patients with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy involves the resection of the epileptogenic focus. The impact of these resections on the perceptual behaviors and organization of visual cortex remain largely unexplored. Here, we characterized the visuoperceptual and neural profiles of ventral visual cortex in a relatively large sample of post-resection pediatric patients. Two major findings emerged. First, most patients exhibited preserved visuoperceptual performance across a wide-range of visual behaviors. Second, normal topography, magnitude, and representational structure of category-selective organization were uncovered in the spared hemisphere. These comprehensive imaging and behavioral investigations uncovered novel evidence concerning the neural representations and visual functions in children who have undergone cortical resection, and have implications for cortical plasticity more generally.

AB  - Investigations of functional (re)organization in children who have undergone large cortical resections offer a unique opportunity to elucidate the nature and extent of cortical plasticity. We report findings from a 3-year investigation of a child, U.D., who underwent surgical removal of the right occipital and posterior temporal lobes at age 6 years 9 months. Relative to controls, post-surgically, U.D. showed age-appropriate intellectual performance and visuoperceptual face and object recognition skills. Using fMRI at five different time points, we observed a persistent hemianopia and no visual field remapping. In category-selective visual cortices, however, object- and scene-selective regions in the intact left hemisphere were stable early on, but regions subserving face and word recognition emerged later and evinced competition for cortical representation. These findings reveal alterations in the selectivity and topography of category-selective regions when confined to a single hemisphere and provide insights into dynamic functional changes in extrastriate cortical architecture. Liu et al. present longitudinal behavioral and neuroimaging evidence tracking the development of and dynamic competition between face and word processing in a single (left) hemisphere following right occipito-temporal lobectomy in a young child. Normal intermediate and complex perception was evident, attesting to functional plasticity in the higher-order visual cortex. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Reading is an important high-level cognitive function of the human brain, requiring interaction among multiple brain regions. Revealing differences between children's large-scale functional brain networks for reading tasks and those of adults helps us to understand how the functional network changes over reading development. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 17 adults (19–28 years old) and 16 children (11–13 years old), and graph theoretical analyses to investigate age-related changes in large-scale functional networks during rhyming and meaning judgment tasks on pairs of visually presented Chinese characters. We found that: (1) adults had stronger inter-regional connectivity and nodal degree in occipital regions, while children had stronger inter-regional connectivity in temporal regions, suggesting that adults rely more on visual orthographic processing whereas children rely more on auditory phonological processing during reading. (2) Only adults showed between-task differences in inter-regional connectivity and nodal degree, whereas children showed no task differences, suggesting the topological organization of adults’ reading network is more specialized. (3) Children showed greater inter-regional connectivity and nodal degree than adults in multiple subcortical regions; the hubs in children were more distributed in subcortical regions while the hubs in adults were more distributed in cortical regions. These findings suggest that reading development is manifested by a shift from reliance on subcortical to cortical regions. Taken together, our study suggests that Chinese reading development is supported by developmental changes in brain connectivity properties, and some of these changes may be domain-general while others may be specific to the reading domain. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Deficits in language and communication are among the core symptoms of autism, a common neurodevelopmental disorder with long-term impairment. Despite the striking nature of the autistic language impairment, knowledge about its corresponding alterations in the brain is still evolving. We hypothesized that the dual stream language network is altered in autism, and that this alteration could be revealed by changes in the relationships between microstructural integrity and functional activation. The study recruited 20 right-handed male youths with autism and 20 carefully matched individually, typically developing (TD) youths. Microstructural integrity of the left dorsal and left ventral pathways responsible for language processing and the functional activation of the connected brain regions were investigated by using diffusion spectrum imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging of a semantic task, respectively. Youths with autism had significantly poorer language function, and lower functional activation in left dorsal and left ventral regions of the language network, compared with TD youths. The TD group showed a significant correlation of the functional activation of the left dorsal region with microstructural integrity of the left ventral pathway, whereas the autism group showed a significant correlation of the functional activation of the left ventral region with microstructural integrity of the left dorsal pathway, and moreover verbal comprehension index was correlated with microstructural integrity of the left ventral pathway. These altered structure-function relationships in autism suggest possible involvement of the dual pathways in supporting deficient semantic processing. © 2013 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The visual attention (VA) span deficit hypothesis of developmental dyslexia posits that impaired multiple element processing can be responsible for poor reading outcomes. In VA span impaired dyslexic children, poor performance on letter report tasks is associated with reduced parietal activations for multiple letter processing. While this hints towards a non-specific, attention-based dysfunction, it is still unclear whether reduced parietal activity generalizes to other types of stimuli. Furthermore, putative links between reduced parietal activity and reduced ventral occipito-temporal (vOT) in dyslexia have yet to be explored. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured brain activity in 12 VA span impaired dyslexic adults and 12 adult skilled readers while they carried out a categorization task on single or multiple alphanumeric or non-alphanumeric characters. While healthy readers activated parietal areas more strongly for multiple than single element processing (right-sided for alphanumeric and bilateral for non-alphanumeric), similar stronger multiple element right parietal activations were absent for dyslexic participants. Contrasts between skilled and dyslexic readers revealed significantly reduced right superior parietal lobule (SPL) activity for dyslexic readers regardless of stimuli type. Using a priori anatomically defined regions of interest, we showed that neural activity was reduced for dyslexic participants in both SPL and vOT bilaterally. Finally, we used multiple regressions to test whether SPL activity was related to vOT activity in each group. In the left hemisphere, SPL activity covaried with vOT activity for both normal and dyslexic readers. In contrast, in the right hemisphere, SPL activity covaried with vOT activity only for dyslexic readers. These results bring critical support to the VA interpretation of the VA Span deficit. In addition, they offer a new insight on how deficits in automatic vOT based word recognition could arise in developmental dyslexia. © 2014 Lobier, Peyrin, Pichat, Le Bas and Valdois.

AB  - Reading, one of the most important cultural inventions of human society, critically depends on posterior brain areas of the left hemisphere in proficient adult readers. In children, this left hemispheric cortical specialization for letter strings is typically detected only after approximately 1 y of formal schooling and reading acquisition. Here, we recorded scalp electrophysiological (EEG) brain responses in 5-y-old (n = 40) prereaders presented with letter strings appearing every five items in rapid streams of pseudofonts (6 items per second). Within 2 min of recording only, letter strings evoked a robust specific response over the left occipito- Temporal cortex at the predefined frequency of 1.2 Hz (i.e., 6 Hz/5). Interindividual differences in the amplitude of this electrophysiological response are significantly related to letter knowledge, a preschool predictor of later reading ability. These results point to the high potential of this rapidly collected behavior-free measure to assess reading ability in developmental populations. These findings were replicated in a second experiment (n = 26 preschool children),where familiar symbols and line drawings of objects evoked right-lateralized and bilaterally specific responses, respectively, showing the specificity of the early left hemispheric dominance for letter strings. Collectively, these findings indicate that limited knowledge of print in young children, before formal education, is sufficient to develop specialized left lateralized neuronal circuits, thereby pointing to an early onset and rapid impact of left hemispheric reentrant sound mapping on posterior cortical development.

TI  - Developmental bias for number words in the intraparietal sulcus
AU  - Lussier, C.A.

T2  - Developmental Science
AB  - Children and adults show behavioral evidence of psychological overlap between their early, non-symbolic numerical concepts and their later-developing symbolic numerical concepts. An open question is to what extent the common cognitive signatures observed between different numerical notations are coupled with physical overlap in neural processes. We show that from 8 years of age, regions of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) that exhibit a numerical ratio effect during non-symbolic numerical judgments also show a semantic distance effect for symbolic number words. In both children and adults, the IPS showed a semantic distance effect during magnitude judgments of number words (i.e. larger/smaller number) but not for magnitude judgments of object words (i.e. larger/smaller object size). The results provide novel evidence of conceptual overlap between neural representations of symbolic and non-symbolic numerical values that cannot be explained by a general process, and present the first demonstration of an early-developing dissociation between number words and object words in the human brain. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Convergent data from neuroimaging, neuropsychological, genetic and neurochemical studies in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have implicated dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which form the cortical arm of the frontostriatal network supporting executive functions. Furthermore, besides the DLPFC and dACC, structural and functional imaging studies have shown abnormalities in key brain regions within distributed cortical networks supporting attention. The conceptualization of neural systems biology in ADHD aims at the understanding of what organizing principles have been altered during development within the brain of a person with ADHD.Characterizing these neural systems using neuroimaging could be critical for the description of structural endophenotypes, and may provide the capability of in vivo categorization and correlation with behavior and genes.

AB  - In the current study, we present a novel fMRI protocol in which words, pseudowords, and other word-like stimuli are passively presented in a rapid, sequential fashion. In this “fast” localizer paradigm, items are presented in groups of four; within sets, words are related in orthographic, phonological, and/or semantic properties. We tested this protocol with a group of skilled adult readers (N=18). Analyses uncovered key regions of the reading network that were sensitive to different component processes at the group level; namely, left fusiform gyrus as well as the pars opercularis subregion of inferior frontal gyrus were sensitive to lexicality; several regions including left precentral gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus were sensitive to spelling-sound consistency; the pars triangularis subregion of inferior frontal gyrus was sensitive to semantic similarity. Additionally, in a number of key brain regions, activation in response to semantically similar words was related to individual differences in reading comprehension outside the scanner. Importantly, these findings are in line with previous investigations of the reading network, yet data were obtained using much less imaging time than comparable paradigms currently available, especially relative to the number of indices of component processes obtained. This feature, combined with the relatively simple nature of the task, renders it appropriate for groups of subjects with a wide range of reading abilities, including children with impairments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A known contributor to adults' superior memory performance compared to children is their differential reliance on an existing knowledge base. Compared to those of adults, children's semantic networks are less accessible and less established, a difference that is also thought to contribute to children's relative resistance to semantically related false alarms. Using the " congruency effect" - the memory advantage of congruity, we manipulated the encoded stimuli in the present experiment such that the use of the knowledge base at encoding was more - or less - accessible in both children and adults. While being scanned, 15 children (ages 8-11) and 18 young adults saw printed noun/color combinations and were asked to indicate whether each combination existed in nature. A subsequent recognition test was administered outside of the scanner. Behaviorally, although overall memory was higher in the adult group compared to the children, both age groups showed the congruency effect to the same extent. A comparison of the neural substrates supporting the congruency effect between adults and children revealed that whereas adults recruited regions primarily associated with semantic-conceptual processing (e.g., the left PFC and parietal and occipito-temporal cortices), children recruited regions earlier in the processing stream (e.g., the right occipital cortex). This evidence supports the hypothesis that early in development, episodic encoding depends more on perceptual systems, whereas top-down frontal control and parietal structures become more prominent in the encoding process with age. This developmental switch contributes to adults' superior memory performance but may render adults more vulnerable to committing semantically based errors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We report the case of a 14-year-old girl suffering from severe developmental visual impairment along with delayed language and cognitive development, and featuring a clear-cut dissociation between spared dorsal and impaired ventral visual pathways. Visual recognition of objects, including faces and printed words, was affected. In contrast, movement perception and visually guided motor control were preserved. Structural MRI was normal on inspection, but Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) revealed reduced grey matter density in the mesial occipital and ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Functional MRI during the perception of line drawings uncovered impaired differentiation which is normally observed at even younger ages: no local category preferences could be identified within the occipito-temporal cortex for faces, houses, words or tools. In contrast, movement-related activations appeared to be normal. Finally, those abnormalities evolved on the background of chronic bilateral occipital epileptic activity, including continuous spike-wave discharges during sleep, which may be considered as the primary cause of non-specific intellectual disability and visual impairment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Neural Bases of Phonological and Semantic Processing in Early Childhood
AU  - Mathur, A.

T2  - Brain connectivity
AB  - During the early period of reading development, children gain phonological (letter-to-sound mapping) and semantic knowledge (storage and retrieval of word meaning). Their reading ability changes rapidly, accompanied by learning-induced brain plasticity as they learn to read. This study aims at identifying the neural bases of phonological and semantic processing in early childhood by using a combination of univariate and multivariate pattern analysis. Nineteen typically developing children between the age of five and seven performed visual word-level phonological (rhyming) and semantic (related meaning) judgment tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Our multivariate analysis showed that young children with good reading ability have already recruited the left hemispheric regions in the brain for phonological processing, including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), superior and middle temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. In addition, our multivariate results suggested that different sub-regions of the left IFG were recruited for the two tasks. Our results suggested the left lateralization of frontotemporal regions for phonological processing and semantic processing. In addition, we observed bilateral activations of parietal regions for semantic processing during early childhood. Our findings indicate that the neural bases of reading have already begun to be shaped in early childhood for typically developing children, which can be used as a control baseline for comparison of children at risk for reading difficulties.

TI  - A Neurocomputational Account of Taxonomic Responding and Fast Mapping in Early Word Learning
AU  - Mayor, J.
AU  - Plunkett, K.
T2  - Psychological Review
AB  - We present a neurocomputational model with self-organizing maps that accounts for the emergence of taxonomic responding and fast mapping in early word learning, as well as a rapid increase in the rate of acquisition of words observed in late infancy. The quality and efficiency of generalization of word-object associations is directly related to the quality of prelexical, categorical representations in the model. We show how synaptogenesis supports coherent generalization of word-object associations and show that later synaptic pruning minimizes metabolic costs without being detrimental to word learning. The role played by joint-attentional activities is identified in the model, both at the level of selecting efficient cross-modal synapses and at the behavioral level, by accelerating and refining overall vocabulary acquisition. The model can account for the qualitative shift in the way infants use words, from an associative to a referential-like use, for the pattern of overextension errors in production and comprehension observed during early childhood and typicality effects observed in lexical development. Interesting by-products of the model include a potential explanation of the shift from prototype to exemplar-based effects reported for adult category formation, an account of mispronunciation effects in early lexical development, and extendability to include accounts of individual differences in lexical development and specific disorders such as Williams syndrome. The model demonstrates how an established constraint on lexical learning, which has often been regarded as domain-specific, can emerge from domain-general learning principles that are simultaneously biologically, psychologically, and socially plausible. © 2010 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Background: Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by deficits in social-emotional, social-communicative, and language skills. Behavioral and neuroimaging studies have found that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) evidence abnormalities in semantic processing, with particular difficulties in verbal comprehension. However, it is not known whether these semantic deficits are confined to the verbal domain or represent a more general problem with semantic processing. The focus of the current study was to investigate verbal and meaningful nonverbal semantic processing in high-functioning children with autism (mean age = 5.8 years) using event-related potentials (ERPs). Method: ERPs were recorded while children attended to semantically matching and mismatching picture-word and picture-environmental sound pairs. Results: ERPs of typically developing children exhibited evidence of semantic incongruency detection in both the word and environmental sound conditions, as indexed by elicitation of an N400 effect. In contrast, children with ASD showed an N400 effect in the environmental sound condition but not in the word condition. Conclusions: These results provide evidence for a deficiency in the automatic activation of semantic representations in children with ASD, and suggest that this deficit is somewhat more selective to, or more severe in, the verbal than the nonverbal domain. © 2009 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

AB  - A procedure is introduced for using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to identify neural regions associated with attention to semantic and phonological aspects of written words within a single group of subjects. Short lists (16 words/list), consisting of visually-presented semantically-related words (bed, rest) or rhyming words (weep, beep) were presented rapidly to subjects, who were asked to attend to the relations among the words. Regions preferentially involved in attention to semantic relations appeared within left anterior/ventral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, approximate Brodmann Area, BA47), left posterior/dorsal IFG (BA44/45), left superior/middle temporal cortex (BA22/21), left fusiform gyrus (BA37), and right cerebellum. Regions preferentially involved in attention to phonological relations appeared within left inferior frontal cortex (near BA6/44, posterior to the semantic regions within IFG described above) and within bilateral inferior parietal cortex (BA40) and precuneus (BA7). This method is notable in that a comparison of the two tasks within some of the individual subjects revealed activation patterns similar to the group average, especially within left inferior frontal and left superior/middle parietal cortices. This fact combined with the efficiency with which the data can be obtained (here, in about an hour of functional scanning) and the adaptability of the task for many different subject populations suggests a wide range of possibilities for this technique: it could be used to track language development (e.g. in children), compare language organization across subject populations (e.g. for dyslexic or blind subjects), and identify language regions within individuals (e.g. potentially to aid in surgical planning). © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to dissociate the neural correlates of semantic and phonological processes during word reading and picture naming. Previous studies have addressed this issue by contrasting tasks involving semantic and phonological decisions. However, these tasks engage verbal short-term memory and executive functions that are not required for reading and naming. Here, 20 subjects were instructed to overtly name written words and pictures of objects while their neuronal responses were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Each trial consisted of a pair of successive stimuli that were either semantically related (e.g., "ROBIN-nest"), phonologically related (e.g., "BELL-belt"), unrelated (e.g., "KITE-lobster"), or semantically and phonologically identical (e.g., "FRIDGE-fridge"). In addition, a pair of stimuli could be presented in either the same modality (word-word or picture-picture) or a different modality (word-picture or picture-word). We report that semantically related pairs modulate neuronal responses in a left-lateralized network, including the pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus, the angular gyrus, and the superior frontal gyrus. We propose that these areas are involved in stimulus-driven semantic processes. In contrast, phonologically related pairs modulate neuronal responses in bilateral insula. This region is therefore implicated in the discrimination of similar, competing phonological and articulatory codes. The above effects were detected with both words and pictures and did not differ between the two modalities even with a less conservative statistical threshold. In conclusion, this study dissociates the effects of semantic and phonological relatedness between successive items during reading and naming aloud. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - An event-related potential (ERP) experiment was conducted to investigate the development of orthographic and phonological processing during Chinese sentence reading between school children and adult readers. Participants were visually presented with sentences, word-by-word, and were asked to judge whether the sentences were semantically acceptable. The crucial manipulation was on the sentence-final two-character compound words, which were either correct or incorrect. For the incorrect compounds, the second characters of the base words were replaced by homophonic or orthographically similar characters. ERP results showed that, across participant groups, the peak of P200 appeared earlier for the homophonic condition than for the orthographic and the baseline conditions. Importantly, for both child and adult readers, relative to the baseline, both orthographic mismatch in the homophonic condition and phonological mismatch in the orthographic condition elicited N400 effects. While for adults these effects appeared to be equal in size, the peak of the N400 component appeared earlier for orthographic mismatch than for phonological mismatch. For children the N400 effect was larger for orthographic mismatch than for phonological mismatch. The N400 component was also more negative for children than for adults in the homophonic condition, and its peak appeared later for children than for adults in the homophonic and the baseline conditions. Moreover, the offset of the N400 effects appeared earlier for adults than for children and for orthographic mismatch than for phonological mismatch. These findings suggest that both Chinese adult readers and school children rely more on orthographic information than on phonological information to access lexical semantics in reading Chinese sentences. However, the differential effects between orthography and phonology may have different ERP manifestations in adults and children. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Memory formation for newly acquired associations typically depends on hippocampal-neocortical interactions. Through the process of system-consolidation, the mnemonic binding role of the hippocampus is subsequently replaced by cortical hubs, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) or the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). Here, using BOLD-fMRI, we compared retrieval of semantic associations acquired through Fast Mapping (FM), an incidental, exclusion-based learning procedure, to retrieval of similar associations that were intentionally acquired through Explicit Encoding (EE). Despite an identical retrieval task, the encoding histories of the retrieved semantic associations (FM vs. EE) induced distinct neural substrates and disparate related neural dynamics in time. Retrieval of associations acquired through EE engaged the expected hippocampal and vmPFC related networks. Furthermore, retrieval intentionally encoded associations gave rise to a typical overnight increase in engagement of the vmPFC and increased vmPFC-hippocampal-neocortical functional connectivity. On the other hand, retrieval of associations acquired through FM immediately engaged an ATL related network that typically supports well-established semantic knowledge, a network that did not engage the hippocampus and the vmPFC. Moreover, FM learning was associated with minimal overnight changes in the BOLD responses and in the functional connectivity. Our findings indicate that FM may induce a direct, ATL-mediated acquisition and retention of novel arbitrary associations, bypassing the initial hippocampal-cortical representation phase. A direct, ATL-mediated vocabulary acquisition through FM could support the learning and retention of new associations in young children with presumably an immature hippocampal system, and possibly even in amnesic adults with hippocampal lesions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Gliomas in children
AU  - Minturn, J.E.
AU  - Fisher, M.J.
T2  - Current Treatment Options in Neurology
AB  - Opinion statement: Gliomas are the most common brain tumor in children and represent nearly 50 % of all pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors. They are a heterogeneous group of diseases, ranging from highly malignant and frequently fatal to histologically benign and curable by surgery alone. A uniform treatment approach to these tumors is not practical, due to their histological and biological heterogeneity. Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are best treated with maximally safe surgical resection, generally achievable for hemispheric or cerebellar locations. Patients with deep midline, optic pathway/hypothalamic, and brain stem locations should undergo subtotal resection or biopsy only. If a complete resection is not feasible, subtotal resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy is the standard approach; however, observation alone with serial neuroimaging is used in some asymptomatic, surgically inaccessible lesions. Chemotherapy is used first-line in cases of residual or progressive disease, to avoid or delay radiation therapy and its associated side effects. Regimens demonstrating objective responses and increased progression free survival (PFS) include carboplatin and vincristine (CV), thioguanine/procarbazine/CCNU/vincristine (TPCV), or weekly vinblastine. High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are less common in children than in adults, though are similar in their aggressive clinical behavior, resistance to therapy, and dismal outcomes. There is not a single "standard of care" therapy for non-metastatic HGGs, but generally accepted is an aggressive attempt at a complete surgical resection, followed by multimodality therapy with focal radiation and chemotherapy. The use of temozolomide (TMZ) during and following radiotherapy is common, though it appeared not to improve the outcome in a cooperative group clinical trial when compared to an historical control cohort. The angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab, used alone or in combination with irinotecan, is also commonly used as maintenance therapy after radiation. Current trials are prospectively comparing TMZ to newer agents (vorinostat, bevacizumab) in a randomized phase II trial. Brainstem gliomas are a unique category of childhood gliomas. Approximately 80 % of childhood brainstem gliomas arise within the pons as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG). When biopsied, these are usually HGGs and carry a dismal prognosis. Standard therapy is focal radiation (54-58 Gy), preferably on a clinical trial testing concurrent chemotherapy or biologic agent. No standard chemotherapy agent has impacted survival. The remaining 20 % of brainstem gliomas are low-grade, arise in the midbrain, dorsal medulla, or cervicomedullary junction, and are indolent in nature with a much better prognosis. Improvement in the outcome of all childhood gliomas will require increased knowledge of the underlying biology of these tumors, in order to treat with more biologically based and precise therapies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Episodic memory is the ability to learn, store and recall new information. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a crucial area engaged in this ability. Cognitive training has been demonstrated to improve episodic memory in adults and older subjects. However, there are no studies examining the effects of cognitive training on episodic memory encoding in typically developing children and adolescents. This study investigated the behavioral effects and neural correlates of semantic categorization strategy training in children and adolescents during verbal episodic memory encoding using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants with age range: 7–18 years were scanned before and after semantic categorization training during encoding of word lists. Results showed improved memory performance in adolescents, but not in children. Deactivation of the anterior medial PFC/anterior cingulate and higher activation of the right anterior and lateral orbital gyri, right frontal pole and right middle frontal gyrus activation were found after training in adolescents when compared to children. These findings suggest different maturational paths of brain regions, especially in the PFC, and deactivation of default mode network areas, which are involved in successful memory and executive processes in the developing brain. © 2020 Miotto et al.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies consistently report language-related cerebellar activations, but evidence from the clinical literature is less conclusive. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by testing the effect of focal cerebellar lesions on cerebral activations in a reading task previously shown to involve distinct cerebellar regions. Patients (N = 10) had lesions primarily affecting medial cerebellum, overlapping cerebellar regions activated during the presentation of random word sequences, but distinct from activations related to semantic prediction generation and prediction error processing. In line with this pattern of activation–lesion overlap, patients did not differ from matched healthy controls (N = 10) in predictability-related activations. However, whereas controls showed increased activation in bilateral auditory cortex and parietal operculum when silently reading familiar words relative to viewing letter strings, this effect was absent in the patients. Our results highlight the need for careful lesion mapping and suggest possible roles for the cerebellum in visual-to-auditory mapping and/or inner speech. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous, neurodevelopmental disorder which co-occurs often with Reading Disability (RD). ADHD with and without RD consistently have higher inattentive ratings compared with typically developing controls, with co-occurring ADHD and RD also demonstrating impaired phonological processing. Accordingly, inattention has been associated with greater phonological impairment, though the neural correlates of the association are poorly understood from a functional neuroimaging perspective. It was postulated that only the co-occurring subgroup would demonstrate hypoactivation of posterior, left hemispheric, reading-related areas and, to a lesser extent, alterations in right hemispheric, attention areas compared with controls. Methods: A novel word rhyming Continuous Performance Task assesses functional activation differences in phonology- and attention-related areas between three groups: ten boys with ADHD and RD, fourteen boys with ADHD without RD, and fourteen typically developing controls. Subjects respond to words that rhyme with a target word as mono- and disyllabic, English words are visually presented over 90. s blocks. Results: Behavioral performance was not different between groups. Some hypoactivation of left hemispheric, reading-related areas was apparent in ADHD and RD, but not ADHD without RD, compared with controls. Right hemispheric, attention areas showed alterations in both ADHD subgroups relative to controls; however, the differences for each subgroup were dissimilar. Conclusions: The dorsal decoding subnetwork may not be grossly compromised in ADHD with Reading Disability. The role of cognitive impairments, including the level of inattention, on phonology requires clarification from a neuroimaging perspective. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Lexical-semantic knowledge is a core language component that undergoes prolonged development throughout childhood and is therefore highly amenable to developmental studies. Most previous lexical-semantic functional MRI (fMRI) studies have been limited to single-word or word-pair tasks, outside a sentence context. Our objective was to investigate the development of lexical-semantic language networks in typically developing children using a more 'ecological' sentence-embedded semantic task that permitted performance monitoring while minimizing head movement by avoiding overt speech. Sixteen adults and 23 children completed two fMRI runs of an auditory lexical-semantic decision task with a button-press response, using reverse speech as control condition. Children and adults showed similar activation in bilateral temporal and left inferior frontal regions. Greater activation in adults than in children was seen in left inferior parietal, premotor, and inferior frontal regions, and in bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA). Specifically for semantically incongruous sentences, adults also showed greater activation than children in left inferior frontal cortex, possibly related to enhanced 'top-down' control. Age-dependent activation increases in motor-related regions were shown to be unrelated to overt motor responses, but could be associated with covert speech accompanying semantic decision. Unlike previous studies, age-dependent differences were not detected in posterior sensory cortices (such as extrastriate cortex), nor in middle temporal gyrus. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Shortly after reading instruction, a region in the ventral occipital temporal cortex (vOTC) of the left hemisphere, the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), becomes specialized for written words. Its reproducible location across scripts suggests important anatomical constraints, such as specific patterns of connectivity, notably to spoken language areas. Here, we explored the structural connectivity of the emerging VWFA in terms of its specificity relative to other ventral visual regions and its stability throughout the process of reading instruction in ten children studied longitudinally over 2 years. Category-specific regions for words, houses, faces, and tools were identified in the left vOTC of each subject with functional MRI. With diffusion MRI and tractography, we reconstructed the connections of these regions at two time points (mean age ± standard deviation: 6.2 ± 0.3, 7.2 ± 0.4 years). We first showed that the regions for each visual category harbor their own specific connectivity, all of which precede reading instruction and remain stable throughout development. The most specific connections of the VWFA were to the dorsal posterior parietal cortex. We then showed that microstructural changes in these connections correlated with improvements in reading scores over the first year of instruction but not 1 year later in a subsample of eight children (age: 8.4 ± 0.3 years). These results suggest that the VWFA location depends on its connectivity to distant regions, in particular, the left inferior parietal region which may play a crucial role in visual field maps and eye movement dynamics in addition to attentional control in letter-by-letter reading and disambiguation of mirror-letters during the first stages of learning to read. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

T2  - Epilepsia
AB  - Purpose: To determine the distribution of various epilepsies and epileptic syndromes in the epileptic population treated in a university hospital in a developing country. Methods: Data concerning 2,531 patients with epilepsy seen between January 1989 and June 1994 were analyzed using the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification. Results: Of 2,531 cases, 48% fell into ILAE categories 1.3, 3.2, or 4.1 (cryptogenic, without unequivocal generalized or focal seizures; or situation-related seizures, respectively). Localization-related epilepsies (LREs) and epileptic syndromes (1.1, 1.2, 1.3) were found in 1,591 (62.9%) patients; of these patients, symptomatic localization-related epilepsies totaled 62.7%, and idiopathic localization-related epilepsies accounted for only 0.7%. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy was the most common type of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), comprising 4.9% of the total study population and 7.7% of patients registered in the epilepsy clinic. A combination of childhood and juvenile absence epilepsies were found in only 0.4% of the total study population. Single computed tomography (CT) enhancing lesion (SCTEL) and focal cerebral calcification (FCC) accounted for 22% of the etiologic factors for localization-related epilepsies. Neurologic deficits were found in 9.5% of patients with SCTEL; none were found with FCC. None of the patients with these lesions had any history of antecedent events that suggested CNS involvement. In patients with localization-related epilepsies with unremarkable clinical data, the proportion of CT scans showing SCTELs was 39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.43) and 0.18 (95% CI, 15-0.21) for FCCs. The proportion for both lesions together was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.53-0.61). Seizures did not recur once the lesion resolved in patients with SCTELs. In patients with FCCs, seizure remission was 71.5% (95% CI, 53.7-85.4) at 3 years. Conclusions: This study illustrates the rarity in one patient population of some of the syndromes and categories described in the ILAE classification. Childhood and juvenile absence epilepsies together formed a small proportion. SCTEL and FCC were important etiologic factors for localization related epilepsies. The epilepsy associated with SCTEL was a form of benign epilepsy; epilepsy associated with FCC had remission rates similar to other remote symptomatic epilepsies. Without neuroimaging evidence, these 2 lesions would have been missed and the patients might have been grouped under cryptogenic localization related epilepsy. For this reason, we emphasize the need for neuroimaging in patients with localization related epilepsies with unremarkable clinical findings, before classification into the cryptogenic category. In the absence of neuroimaging, such patients should be classified as 'probably cryptogenic'.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and acquired disability in the pediatric population worldwide. We hypothesized that electroencephalography (EEG) synchrony and its temporal variability, analyzed during the acute phase following TBI, would be altered from that of normal children and as such would offer insights into TBI pathophysiology. Seventeen pediatric patients with mild to severe head injury admitted to a pediatric critical care unit were recruited along with 10 age- and gender-matched controls. Patients had two electroencephalographs performed 3 days apart. Outcome was measured at 1 year post-TBI utilizing the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score (PCPC). Maximal synchrony between EEG channels correlated to areas of primary injury as seen on computed tomography (CT) scan. The temporal variability of phase synchronization among EEG electrodes increased as patients recovered and emerged from coma (p < 0.001). This temporal variability correlated with outcome (Pearson coefficient of 0.74) better than the worst Glasgow Coma Scale score, length of coma, or extent of injury on CT scan. This represents a novel approach in the evaluation of TBI in children. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Three hundred and twelve children referred to an outpatient pediatric neurology clinic, with headache that lasted more than 3 months, were retrospectively reviewed. On average, the age of pain onset was 8.4 years. Migraine was diagnosed in 54% of these children and tension-type headache was found in 22% of those with chronic headache. Most children (85%) had common migraine, while classic and complicated migraine was found in only 8.8% and 5.3%, respectively. Brief headaches, lasting from seconds to a few minutes, were found in 5.1% of the children evaluated. In this subgroup, a high rate of epileptic EEG activity was found. Out of 110 children who had undergone computerized tomography, only one was pathological (posterior arachnoid cyst). Our results indicate that chronic and recurrent headache without accompanying neurological symptoms are usually benign and therefore in most cases neuroimaging is not indicated. © 1994.

AB  - Objective: Impairment of speech repetition following injury to the dorsal language stream is a feature of conduction aphasia, a well-described “disconnection syndrome” in adults. The impact of similar lesions sustained in infancy has not been established. Methods: We compared language outcomes in term-born individuals with confirmed neonatal stroke (n = 30, age = 7–18 years, left-sided lesions in 21 cases) to matched controls (n = 40). Injury to the dorsal and/or ventral language streams was assessed using T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tractography. Language lateralization was determined using functional MRI. Results: At the group level, left dorsal language stream injury was associated with selective speech repetition impairment for nonwords (p = 0.021) and sentences (p &lt; 0.0001). The majority of children with significant repetition impairment had retained left hemisphere language representation, but right hemisphere dominance was correlated with minimal or absent repetition deficits. Post hoc analysis of the repetition-impaired group revealed additional language-associated deficits, but these were more subtle and variable. Interpretation: We conclude that (1) despite the considerable plasticity of the infant brain, early dorsal language stream injury can result in specific and long-lasting problems with speech repetition that are similar to the syndrome of conduction aphasia seen in adults; and (2) language reorganization to the contralateral hemisphere has a protective effect.

AB  - Event-related brain potential (ERP) studies of sentence processing in adults have shown that phrase-structure violations are associated with two ERP components; an early left anterior negativity (ELAN) and a late, centro-parietal positivity (P600). Although the ELAN reflects highly automatic first-pass sentence parsing, the P600 has been interpreted to reflect later, more controlled processes. The present ERP study investigates the processing of phrase-structure violations in children below three years of age. Both children (mean age of 2.8 years) and adults passively listened to short active sentences that were either correct or syntactically incorrect. Adults displayed an ELAN that was followed by a P600 to the syntactic violation. Children also demonstrated a biphasic ERP pattern consisting of an early left hemispheric negativity and a late positivity. Both components, however, started later and persisted longer than those observed in adults. The left lateralixation of the children's negativity suggests that this component can be interpreted as a child-specific precursor to the ELAN observed in adults. The appearance of the early negativity indicates that the neural mechanisms of syntactic parsing are present, in principle, during early language development. © 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Children's foreign-language (FL) learning is a matter of much social as well as scientific debate. Previous behavioral research indicates that starting language learning late in life can lead to problems in phonological processing. Inadequate phonological capacity may impede lexical learning and semantic processing (phonological bottleneck hypothesis). Using both behavioral and neuroimaging data, here we examine the effects of age of first exposure (AOFE) and total hours of exposure (HOE) to English, on 350 Japanese primary-school children's semantic processing of spoken English. Children's English proficiency scores and N400 event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were analyzed in multiple regression analyses. The results showed (1) that later, rather than earlier, AOFE led to higher English proficiency and larger N400 amplitudes, when HOE was controlled for; and (2) that longer HOE led to higher English proficiency and larger N400 amplitudes, whether AOFE was controlled for or not. These data highlight the important role of amount of exposure in FL learning, and cast doubt on the view that starting FL learning earlier always produces better results. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

AB  - Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficuly in recognizing bodies and faces, which are more pronounced in children than adults. If such difficulties originate from dysfunction of the extrastriate body area (EBA) and the fusiform face area (FFA), activation in these regions might be more atypical in children than in adults. We preformed functional magnetic resonance imaging while children and adults with ASD and age-matched typically developed (TD) individuals observed face, body, car, and scene. To examine various aspects, we performed individual region of interest (ROI) analysis, as well as conventional random effect group analysis. At individual ROI analysis, we examined the ratio of participants showing a category-sensitive response, the size of regions, location and activation patterns among the four object categories. Adults with ASD showed no atypicalities in activation of the EBA and FFA, whereas children with ASD showed atypical activation in these regions. Specifically, a smaller percentage of children with ASD showed face-sensitive activation of the FFA than TD children. Moreover, the size of the EBA was smaller in children with ASD than in TD children. Our results revealed atypicalities in both the FFA and EBA in children with ASD but not in adults with ASD. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and Japan Neuroscience Society

AB  - Visual processing in the primate brain is highly organized along the ventral visual pathway, although it is still unclear how categorical selectivity emerges in this system. While many theories have attempted to explain the pattern of visual specialization within the ventral occipital and temporal areas, the biased connectivity hypothesis provides a framework which postulates extrinsic connectivity as a potential mechanism in shaping the development of category selectivity. As the posterior parietal cortex plays a central role in visual attention, we examined whether the pattern of parietal connectivity with the face and scene processing regions is closely linked with the functional properties of these two visually selective networks in a cohort of 60 children ages 9 to 12. Functionally localized face and scene selective regions were used in deriving each visual network's resting-state functional connectivity. The children's face and scene processing networks appeared to show a weak network segregation during resting state, which was confirmed when compared to that of a group of gender and handedness matched adults. Parietal regions of these children showed differential connectivity with the face and scene networks, and the extent of this differential parietal-visual connectivity predicted individual differences in the degree of segregation between the two visual networks, which in turn predicted individual differences in visual perception performance. Finally, the pattern of parietal connectivity with the face processing network also predicted the foci of face-related activation in the right fusiform gyrus across children. These findings provide evidence that extrinsic connectivity with regions such as the posterior parietal cortex may have important implications in the development of specialized visual processing networks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Maturational constraints on the recruitment of early processes for syntactic processing
AU  - Pakulak, E.
AU  - Neville, H.J.
T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - An enduring question in the study of second-language acquisition concerns the relative contributions of age of acquisition (AOA) and ultimate linguistic proficiency to neural organization for second-language processing. Several ERP and neuroimaging studies of second-language learners have found that neural organization for syntactic processing is sensitive to delays in secondlanguage acquisition. However, such delays in second-language acquisition are typically associated with lower language proficiency, rendering it difficult to assess whether differences in AOA or proficiency lead to these effects. Here we examined the effects of delayed second-language acquisition while controlling for proficiency differences by examining participants who differ in AOA but who were matched for proficiency in the same language. We compared the ERP response to auditory English phrase structure violations in a group of late learners of English matched for grammatical proficiency with a group of English native speakers. In the native speaker group, violations elicited a bilateral and prolonged anterior negativity, with onset at 100 msec, followed by a posterior positivity (P600). In contrast, in the nonnative speaker group, violations did not elicit the early anterior negativity, but did elicit a P600 which was more widespread spatially and temporally than that of the native speaker group. These results suggest that neural organization for syntactic processing is sensitive to delays in language acquisition independently of proficiency level. More specifically, they suggest that both early and later syntactic processes are sensitive to maturational constraints. These results also suggest that late learners who reach a high level of second-language proficiency rely on different neural mechanisms than native speakers of that language. © 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - The development of language hemispheric specialization is not well understood in young children, especially regarding expressive language functions. In this study, we investigated age-related changes in expressive language lateralization patterns in a population of children (3-6 and 7-10 years old), adolescents (11-16 years old), and young adults (19-30 years old). During functional near-infrared spectroscopy recordings, all participants performed a verbal fluency task, which consisted in naming as many words as possible belonging to a given semantic category. Hemoglobin concentration changes were measured in bilateral frontal and temporal cortical areas. During the language task, results showed a strong left hemisphere response along with weaker right hemisphere activation in all groups. Age-related increases in hemodynamic responses were found bilaterally, with younger children showing smaller hemodynamic responses than adolescents and adults in both hemispheres. Overall, these findings confirm that a left hemisphere specialization is already established in young children and persists through adulthood. Early left hemisphere specialization for expressive language suggests that language development hinges on structural and functional properties of the human brain with little reorganization occurring with development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - Developmental Science
AB  - Viewing faces or bodies activates category-selective areas of visual cortex, including the fusiform face area (FFA), fusiform body area (FBA), and extrastriate body area (EBA). Here, using fMRI, we investigate the development of these areas, focusing on the right FFA and FBA. Despite the overlap of functionally defined FFA and FBA (54%-75% overlap), we found that these regions developed along different trajectories. With age (7-32 years old), the FFA gradually increased in size and selectivity, and was significantly larger and more face-selective in adults than children. By contrast, the size and selectivity of the FBA did not correlate with age, and were equivalent in children and adults. Whereas in adults the FFA and FBA were comparable in size, in children the FBA was on average 70% larger than the FFA. These findings suggest that, in children, the fusiform gyrus is predominantly selective for bodies, with commensurate face-selective responses apparent later in development. Moreover, differences in the development of the FFA and FBA indicate that overlapping functional brain areas, supported by the same anatomical structure, can develop along different trajectories. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

T2  - Frontiers in Human Neuroscience
AB  - It is well known that adult human extrastriate visual cortex contains areas that respond in a selective fashion to specific categories of visual stimuli. Three regions have been identified with particular regularity: the fusiform face area (FFA), which responds to faces more than to other objects; the parahippocampal place area (PPA), which responds selectively to images of houses, places, and visual scenes; and the extrastriate body area (EBA), which responds specifically to images of bodies and body parts. While the presence of these regions in the mature human brain is well-established, the degree to which children possess these areas and the degree of functional specialization of these areas in children of various ages has thus far remained unclear. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined the development of the FFA, EBA, and PPA in healthy, typically developing 7- to 11-year-old children and adults. Our results revealed a right FFA and a bilateral EBA and PPA in the children that were localized in a way consistent with these same regions in adults. In addition, the response profiles of these regions were very similar in adults and children with comparable levels of functional specificity at all of the ages tested. We discuss the implications of this research for understanding abnormal regional specialization for social and nonsocial object categories in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. © 2009 Pelphrey, Lopez and Morris.

AB  - Objective. Abnormalities in brain structure, cognition, and behavior have been described in children born prematurely. However, no direct in vivo evidence has yet demonstrated abnormal neural processing in these children. Our aim was to compare brain activity associated with phonologic and semantic processing of language between term and preterm children using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods. fMRI scans were acquired during a passive language comprehension task in 26 preterm children at 8 years of age and in 13 term community control children who were comparable in age, sex, maternal education, and minority status. IQ was assessed using a standard measure of intelligence. Results. The pattern of brain activity identified in a semantic processing task in the preterm children closely resembled the pattern of brain activity identified in a phonologic processing task in term controls. The greater this resemblance in the preterm children, the lower their verbal comprehension IQ scores and the poorer their language comprehension during the scanning task. Conclusions. Preterm children with the poorest language comprehension seemed not to fully engage normal semantic processing pathways in a language comprehension task. These children instead engaged pathways that normal term children used to process meaningless phonologic sounds. Aberrant processing of semantic content in these preterm children may account in part for their lower verbal IQ scores.

AB  - A dissociation between phonological and visual attention (VA) span disorders has been reported in dyslexic children. This study investigates whether this cognitively-based dissociation has a neurobiological counterpart through the investigation of two cases of developmental dyslexia. LL showed a phonological disorder but preserved VA span whereas FG exhibited the reverse pattern. During a phonological rhyme judgement task, LL showed decreased activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus whereas this region was activated at the level of the controls in FG. Conversely, during a visual categorization task, FG demonstrated decreased activation of the parietal lobules whereas these regions were activated in LL as in the controls. These contrasted patterns of brain activation thus mirror the cognitive disorders' dissociation. These findings provide the first evidence for an association between distinct brain mechanisms and distinct cognitive deficits in developmental dyslexia, emphasizing the importance of taking into account the heterogeneity of the reading disorder. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders are the most prevalent group of inherited neurometabolic diseases. They present with central and peripheral neurological features usually in association with other organ involvement including the eye, the heart, the liver, and kidneys, diabetes mellitus and sensorineural deafness. Current treatment is largely supportive and the disorders progress relentlessly causing significant morbidity and premature death. Vitamin supplements, pharmacological agents and exercise therapy have been used in isolated cases and small clinical trials, but the efficacy of these interventions is unclear. The first review was carried out in 2003, and identified six clinical trials. This major update was carried out to identify new studies and grade the original studies for potential bias in accordance with revised Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. To determine whether there is objective evidence to support the use of current treatments for mitochondrial disease. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (4 July 2011), CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1966 to July 2011), and EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2011), and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (including cross-over studies). Two of the authors independently selected abstracts for further detailed review. Further review was performed independently by all five authors to decide which trials fit the inclusion criteria and graded risk of bias. Participants included males and females of any age with a confirmed diagnosis of mitochondrial disease based upon muscle histochemistry, respiratory chain complex analysis of tissues or cell lines or DNA studies. Interventions included any pharmacological agent, dietary modification, nutritional supplement, exercise therapy or other treatment. The review authors excluded studies at high risk of bias in any category. The primary outcome measures included an change in muscle strength and/or endurance, or neurological clinical features. Secondary outcome measures included quality of life assessments, biochemical markers of disease and negative outcomes. Two of the authors (GP and PFC) independently identified studies for further evaluation from all abstracts within the search period. For those studies identified for further review, all five authors then independently assessed which studies met the entry criteria. For the included studies, we extracted details of the number of randomised participants, treatment, study design, study category, allocation concealment and other risk of bias criteria, and participant characteristics. Analysis was based on intention-to-treat data. We planned to use meta-analysis, but this did not prove necessary. The authors reviewed 1335 abstracts, and from these identified 21 potentially eligible abstracts. Upon detailed review, 12 studies fulfilled the entry criteria. Of these, eight were new studies that had been published since the previous version of this review. Two studies which were included in the previous version of this review were excluded because of potential for bias. The comparability of the included studies is extremely low because of differences in the specific diseases studied, differences in the therapeutic agents used, dosage, study design, and outcomes. The methodological quality of included studies was generally high, although risk of bias was unclear in random sequence generation and allocation concealment for most studies. Otherwise, the risk of bias was low for most studies in the other categories. Serious adverse events were uncommon, except for peripheral nerve toxicity in a long-term trial of dichloroacetate (DCA) in adults.One trial studied high-dose coenzyme Q10 without clinically meaningful improvement (although there were multiple biochemical, physiologic, and neuroimaging outcomes, in 30 participants). Three trials used creatine monohydrate alone, with one reporting evidence of improved measures of muscle strength and post-exercise lactate, but the other two reported no benefit (total of 38 participants). One trial studied the effects of a combination of coenzyme Q10, creatine monohydrate, and lipoic acid and reported a statistically significant improvement in biochemical markers and peak ankle dorsiflexion strength, but overall no clinical improvement in 16 participants. Five trials studied the effects of DCA: three trials in children showed a statistically significant improvement in secondary outcome measures of mitochondrial metabolism (venous lactate in three trials, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in one trial; total of 63 participants). One trial of short-term DCA in adults demonstrated no clinically relevant improvement (improved venous lactate but no change in physiologic, imaging, or questionnaire findings, in eight participants). One longer-term DCA trial in adults was terminated prematurely due to peripheral nerve toxicity without clinical benefit (assessments included the GATE score, venous lactate and MRS, in 30 participants). One trial using dimethylglycine showed no significant effect (measurements of venous lactate and oxygen consumption (VO(2)) in five participants). One trial using a whey-based supplement showed statistically significant improvement in markers of free radical reducing capacity but no clinical benefit (assessments included the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and UK Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength, in 13 participants). Despite identifying eight new trials there is currently no clear evidence supporting the use of any intervention in mitochondrial disorders. Further research is needed to establish the role of a wide range of therapeutic approaches. We suggest further research should identify novel agents to be tested in homogeneous study populations with clinically relevant primary endpoints.

AB  - From an early age, autobiographical memory models our feeling of identity and continuity. It grows throughout lifetime with our experiences and is built up from general self-knowledge and specific memories. The study of autobiographical memory depicts the dynamic and reconstructive features of this type of long-term memory, combining both semantic and episodic aspects, its strength and fragility. In this article, we propose to illustrate the properties of autobiographical memory from the field of cognitive psychology, neuropsychology and neuroimaging research through the analysis of the mechanisms of disturbance in normal and Alzheimer's disease. We show that the cognitive and neural bases of autobiographical memory are distinct in both cases. In normal aging, autobiographical memory retrieval is mainly dependent on frontal/executive function and on sense of reexperiencing specific context connected to hippocampal regions regardless of memory remoteness. In Alzheimer's disease, autobiographical memory deficit, characterized by a Ribot's temporal gradient, is connected to different regions according to memory remoteness. Our functional neuroimaging results suggestthat patients at the early stage can compensate for their massive deficit of episodic recent memories correlated to hippocampal alteration with overgeneral remote memories related to prefrontal regions. On the whole, the research findings allowed initiating new autobiographical memory studies by comparing normal and pathological aging and developing cognitive methods of memory rehabilitation in patients based on preserved personal semantic capacity. © 2010 Société de Biologie.

AB  - For the majority of the population, language is a left-hemisphere lateralized function. During childhood, a pattern of increasing left lateralization for language has been described in brain imaging studies, suggesting that this trait develops. This development could reflect change due to brain maturation or change due to skill acquisition, given that children acquire and refine language skills as they mature. We test the possibility that skill acquisition, independent of age-associated maturation can result in shifts in language lateralization in classic language cortex. We imaged adults exposed to an unfamiliar language during three successive fMRI scans. Participants were then asked to identify specific words embedded in Norwegian sentences. Exposure to these sentences, relative to complex tones, resulted in consistent activation in the left and right superior temporal gyrus. Activation in this region became increasingly left-lateralized with repeated exposure to the unfamiliar language. These results demonstrate that shifts in lateralization can be produced in the short term within a learning context, independent of maturation. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Introduction. Pedophiles show sexual interest in prepubescent children but not in adults. Research into the neurofunctional mechanisms of paraphilias has gathered momentum over the last years. Aim. To elucidate the underlying neural processing of sexual interest among pedophiles and to highlight the differences in comparison with nonparaphilic sexual interest in adults. Methods. Nine pedophilic patients and 11 nonpedophilic control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing pictures of nude (prepubescents, pubescents, and adults) and neutral content, as well as performing a concomitant choice reaction time task (CRTT). Main Outcome Measures. Brain blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals and response latencies in the CRTT during exposure to each picture category. Results. Analysis of behavioral data showed group differences in reaction times regarding prepubescent and adult but not pubescent stimuli. During stimulation with pictures displaying nude prepubescents, pedophiles showed increased BOLD response in brain areas known to be involved in processing of visual sexual stimuli. Comparison of pedophilic patients with the control group discovered differences in BOLD responses with respect to prepubescent and adult but not to pubescent stimuli. Differential effects in particular occurred in the cingulate gyrus and insular region. Conclusions. The brain response of pedophiles to visual sexual stimulation by images of nude prepubescents is comparable with previously described neural patterns of sexual processing in nonpedophilic human males evoked by visual stimuli depicting nude adults. Nevertheless, group differences found in the cingulate gyrus and the insular region suggest an important role of these brain areas in pedophilic sexual interest. Furthermore, combining attention-based methods like CRTT with fMRI may be a viable option for future diagnostic procedures regarding pedophilia. © 2011 International Society for Sexual Medicine.

T2  - Developmental Neuropsychology
AB  - We evaluated how right- and the left-temporal lobe activation of first (1st LR), second (2ndLR), and third (3rdLR) level readers (N = 60; Age = 6-9 years) varied with reading level, word characteristics, and cognitive abilities by using electroencephalogram measurements while the children read high-frequency/high-imageability, high-frequency/low-imageability, and nonsense words. The ANOVA showed significant interaction effects: 1stLR had greater right-hemispheric activation than 3rdLR, who had greater left-hemispheric activation; for nonsense words, 1stLR had lower left-hemisphere activation than that of 2ndLR and 3rdLR. The electroencephalogram (EEG) measure of hemispheric asymmetry indicated a developmental effect on lateralized activity in the temporal lobes of beginning readers during word reading.

AB  - Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS) is a rare form of acquired aphasia in children, characterized by epileptic discharges, which occur mostly during sleep. After normal speech and language development, aphasia develops between the ages of 3-7. years in a period ranging from days to months. The epileptic discharges usually disappear after reaching adulthood, but language outcomes are usually poor if no treatment focused on restoration of (non-) verbal communication is given. Patients often appear deaf-mute, but sign language, as part of the treatment, may lead to recovery of communication. The neural mechanisms underlying poor language outcomes in LKS are not yet understood. In this detailed functional MRI study of a recovered LKS patient - that is, a patient no longer suffering from epileptic discharges, audiovisual multi-sensory processing was investigated, since LKS patients are often proficient in reading, but not in speech perception. In the recovered LKS patient a large difference in the neural activation to auditory stimuli was found in the left versus the right auditory cortex, which cannot be attributed to hearing loss. Compared to healthy proficient readers investigated earlier with the same fMRI experiment, the patient demonstrated normal letter-sound integration in the superior temporal gyrus as demonstrated by the multi-sensory interaction index, indicating intact STG function. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) based fiber tracking in the LKS patient showed fibers originating from Heschl's gyrus that seem to be left-right inverted with respect to HG fiber pattern described in the literature for healthy controls. In the patient, in both hemispheres we found arcuate fibers projecting from (homologues of) Broca's to Wernicke's areas, and a lack of fibers from arcuate left inferior parietal and sylvian areas reported in healthy subjects. We observed short arcuate segments in the right hemisphere. Although speculative, our results suggest intact temporal lobe processing but an altered temporal to frontal connectivity. The altered connectivity might explain observed short-term verbal memory problems, disturbed (speech) sound-motor interaction and online feedback of speech and might be one of the neuronal factors underlying LKS. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Childhood trauma is a significant risk factor for the development of psychotic disorders, and may influence executive brain functions. We thus set out to investigate the long-term effects of childhood trauma exposure on brain function of adult chronic patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and (psychotic) bipolar-I disorder while performing a standard 2/0-back working memory task. Participants were 50 cases diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (SCZ), 42 cases with bipolar-I disorder (BD), and 47 healthy controls (HC). Among this sample, 56 clinical cases (SCZ = 32; BD = 24) and 17 HC reported significant levels of childhood trauma, while 36 clinical cases (SCZ = 18; BD = 18) and 30 HC did not. Effects of childhood trauma on working memory-related brain activation were examined in combined samples of clinical cases (independently of diagnosis) relative to HCs, as well as within each diagnostic category. Case–control analyses revealed increased activation of the left inferior parietal lobule as a main effect of trauma exposure. In addition, trauma exposure interacted with a diagnosis of SCZ or BD to reveal trauma-related increased activation in the cuneus in clinical cases and decreased activation in this region in controls. Disorder-specific functional alterations were also evident in the SCZ sample, but not BD. Childhood trauma exposure elicits aberrant function of parietal regions involved in working memory performance regardless of clinical status, as well as task-relevant visual regions that participates to attentional processes. Childhood trauma may therefore contribute to alterations in attention in SCZ and BD while performing an n-back working memory task. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the factors predicting seizure outcome in children who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Methods: Among the 664 patients who underwent ATL for TLE from 1995 to 2008, there were 134 children. “Excellent” outcome in them was defined as seizure freedom during the entire follow-up (Engel class I a); “good outcome” if in remission last 2 years, and the rest as “unfavorable outcome”. To identify the potential predictors of seizure recurrence, the attributes of recurred and non-recurred groups was compared by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Of the 134 children, at a mean post-operative follow-up of 8.1 years, there were 82 (61.1%) with excellent outcome and 26 (19.4%) with good outcome (category-1; seizure-free, 80.6%). Drugs could be successfully withdrawn in 69 (63.9%). 26 patients (22.4%) had seizure recurrence, (category-2, treatment/surgical failure).Whereas, of the 530 adults who underwent ATL during this time period, only 46.8% never had seizures (category-1) and 53.2% had seizure recurrence in the form of acute post-operative seizures or auras or habitual or non-habitual seizures (category-2).The hazard of seizure recurrence in children increased with positive family history of seizures and /or epilepsy, normal neuroimaging, spikes in post-operative EEG at 3-months, normal histopathology and duration of epilepsy ≥5 years. Conclusions: The information on the predictive factors causing seizure recurrence/freedom in children with drug-resistant TLE is important in surgical selection. Surgery for pediatric TLE results in favorable outcome, hence one should subject children for resective surgery at the earliest especially in lesions known to cause refractoriness. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A predominant theory regarding early stroke and its effect on language development, is that early left hemisphere lesions trigger compensatory processes that allow the right hemisphere to assume dominant language functions, and this is thought to underlie the near normal language development observed after early stroke. To test this theory, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain activity during category fluency in participants who had sustained pre-or perinatal left hemisphere stroke (n = 25) and in neurologically normal siblings (n = 27). In typically developing children, performance of a category fluency task elicits strong involvement of left frontal and lateral temporal regions and a lesser involvement of right hemisphere structures. In our cohort of atypically developing participants with early stroke, expressive and receptive language skills correlated with activity in the same left inferior frontal regions that support language processing in neurologically normal children. This was true independent of either the amount of brain injury or the extent that the injury was located in classical cortical language processing areas. Participants with bilateral activation in left and right superior temporal-inferior parietal regions had better language function than those with either predominantly left-or right-sided unilateral activation. The advantage conferred by left inferior frontal and bilateral temporal involvement demonstrated in our study supports a strong predisposition for typical neural language organization, despite an intervening injury, and argues against models suggesting that the right hemisphere fully accommodates language function following early injury. © The Author (2010).

AB  - Non-specialists can identify three types of developmental language disorder. (1) mixed receptive/expressive disorders, which impair phonology, syntax, and semantics. Children who understand nothing are nonverbal, in others speech is, sparse, nonfluent, poorly intelligible, and agrammatic; (2) expressive disorders with adequate comprehension affect phonologic production predominantly. Children with verbal dyspraxia, the most severe variant, may also be nonverbal but comprehend well; (3) higher order processing disorders affect semantics, pragmatics, and discourse. Semantics and pragmatics are invariably affected in preschool autistic children in whom isolated expressive deficits do not occur. Etiology of developmental language disorders is predominantly genetic. Structural brain lesions detectable by neuroimaging are exceptional. Severe receptive deficits require a sleep EEG to detect subclinical epilepsy. Early educational intervention is both critical and efficacious.

AB  - Traditionally, the ventral occipito-temporal (vOT) area, but not the superior parietal lobules (SPLs), is thought as belonging to the neural system of visual word recognition. However, some dyslexic children who exhibit a visual attention span disorder - i.e. poor multi-element parallel processing - further show reduced SPLs activation when engaged in visual multi-element categorization tasks. We investigated whether these parietal regions further contribute to letter-identity processing within strings. Adult skilled readers and dyslexic participants with a visual attention span disorder were administered a letter-string comparison task under fMRI. Dyslexic adults were less accurate than skilled readers to detect letter identity substitutions within strings. In skilled readers, letter identity differs related to enhanced activation of the left vOT. However, specific neural responses were further found in the superior and inferior parietal regions, including the SPLs bilaterally. Two brain regions that are specifically related to substituted letter detection, the left SPL and the left vOT, were less activated in dyslexic participants. These findings suggest that the left SPL, like the left vOT, may contribute to letter string processing. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We adjusted an object-naming task with repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rnTMS) originally developed for preoperative cortical language mapping in adults in order for it to be used in children. Two series of pictures were chosen for children above and below 10 years of age, respectively. Firstly, the series of pictures and the preferred speed of presentation were assessed for their applicability in children of different ages and abilities. Secondly, these series were used with rnTMS preoperatively in five children with epilepsy. Naming errors induced by the stimulation comprised no response, delayed response, semantic error, phonological error, and self-correction. Language laterality was compared with the results of a dichotic listening test and with neuropsychological tests with respect to general laterality, and general language abilities were considered with respect to the results of stimulation. One participant had below normal general language abilities, two had below-normal rapid naming, and three had slow and indistinct articulation. Laterality was only clear in two of the participants. All children required breaks of various durations during the process, and individual adjustments of the interpicture interval and other stimulation parameters were also made. We conclude that, after adjustment, rnTMS combined with an object-naming task can be useful for preoperative language mapping in children. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hemispheric specialization for language has been the focus of many studies, mainly using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to investigate hemispheric dominance and time-dependent aspects of cortical language processing. We implemented a verb generation task and a newly designed vowel identification task. Eleven healthy adults were investigated. By using oscillatory magnetoencephalography spectral analysis, significant hemispheric differences were found for both tasks in cerebral language areas. Robust left-lateralization in frontal brain regions was observed with the verb generation task, confirming previous functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies. Our new vowel identification task yields significant left-lateralization in posterior language regions, making this silent and child-friendly task a valuable alternative for non-invasive language assessment in difficult populations. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The identification of reliable brain endophenotypes of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been hampered to date by the heterogeneity in the neuroanatomical abnormalities detected in this condition. To handle the complexity of neuroimaging data and to convert brain images in informative biomarkers of pathology, multivariate analysis techniques based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been widely used in several disease conditions. They are usually trained to distinguish patients from healthy control subjects by making a binary classification. Here, we propose the use of the One-Class Classification (OCC) or Data Description method that, in contrast to two-class classification, is based on a description of one class of objects only. This approach, by defining a multivariate normative rule on one class of subjects, allows recognizing examples from a different category as outliers. We applied the OCC to 314 regional features extracted from brain structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of young children with ASD (21 males and 20 females) and control subjects (20 males and 20 females), matched on age [range: 22-72 months of age; mean = 49 months] and non-verbal intelligence quotient (NVIQ) [range: 31-123; mean = 73]. We demonstrated that a common pattern of features characterize the ASD population. The OCC SVM trained on the group of ASD subjects showed the following performances in the ASD vs. controls separation: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.74 for the male and 0.68 for the female population, respectively. Notably, the ASD vs. controls discrimination results were maximized when evaluated on the subsamples of subjects with NVIQ = 70, leading to AUC = 0.81 for the male and AUC = 0.72 for the female populations, respectively. Language regions and regions from the default mode network-posterior cingulate cortex, pars opercularis and pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, and transverse temporal gyrus-contributed most to distinguishing individuals with ASD from controls, arguing for the crucial role of these areas in the ASD pathophysiology. The observed brain patterns associate preschoolers with ASD independently of their age, gender and NVIQ and therefore they are expected to constitute part of the ASD brain endophenotype. © 2016 Retico, Gori, Giuliano, Muratori and Calderoni.

T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - Semantically reversible sentences are prone to misinterpretation and take longer for typically developing children and adults to comprehend; they are also particularly problematic for those with language difficulties such as aphasia or Specific Language Impairment. In our study, we used fMRI to compare the processing of semantically reversible and nonreversible sentences in 41 healthy participants to identify how semantic reversibility influences neuronal activation. By including several linguistic and nonlinguistic conditions within our paradigm, we were also able to test whether the processing of semantically reversible sentences places additional load on sentence-specific processing, such as syntactic processing and syntactic-semantic integration, or on phonological working memory. Our results identified increased activation for reversible sentences in a region on the left temporal-parietal boundary, which was also activated when the same group of participants carried out an articulation task which involved saying "one, three" repeatedly. We conclude that the processing of semantically reversible sentences places additional demands on the subarticulation component of phonological working memory. © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Using behavioral, structural, and functional imaging techniques, we demonstrate contrasting effects of vocabulary knowledge on temporal and parietal brain structure in 47 healthy volunteers who ranged in age from 7 to 73 years. In the left posterior supramarginal gyrus, vocabulary knowledge was positively correlated with gray matter density in teenagers but not adults. This region was not activated during auditory or visual sentence processing, and activation was unrelated to vocabulary skills. Its gray matter density may reflect the use of an explicit learning strategy that links new words to lexical or conceptual equivalents, as used in formal education and second language acquisition. By contrast, in left posterior temporal regions, gray matter as well as auditory and visual sentence activation correlated with vocabulary knowledge throughout lifespan. We propose that these effects reflect the acquisition of vocabulary through context, when new words are learnt within the context of semantically and syntactically related words. © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Associative learning underlies the formation of new episodic memories. Associative memory improves across development, and this age-related improvement is supported by the development of the hippocampus and pFC. Recent work, however, additionally suggests a role for visual association cortex in the formation of associative memories. This study investigated the role of category-preferential visual processing regions in associative memory across development using a paired associate learning task in a sample of 56 youths (age 6–19 years). Participants were asked to bind an emotional face with an object while undergoing fMRI scanning. Outside the scanner, participants completed a memory test. We first investigated age-related changes in neural recruitment and found linear age-related in- creases in activation in lateral occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus, which are involved in visual processing of objects and faces, respectively. Furthermore, greater activation in these visual processing regions was associated with better subsequent memory for pairs over and above the effect of age and of hippocampal and pFC activation on performance. Recruitment of these visual processing regions mediated the association between age and memory performance, over and above the effects of hippocampal activation. Taken together, these findings extend the existing literature to suggest that greater recruitment of category-preferential visual processing regions during encoding of associative memories is a neural mechanism explaining improved memory across development. © 2017 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Background: During resting-state EEG-fMRI studies in epilepsy, patients' spontaneous head-face movements occur frequently. We tested the usefulness of synchronous video recording to identify and model the fMRI changes associated with non-epileptic movements to improve sensitivity and specificity of fMRI maps related to interictal epileptiform discharges (IED). New methods: Categorization of different facial/cranial movements during EEG-fMRI was obtained for 38 patients [with benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS, n= 16); with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE, n= 17); focal symptomatic/cryptogenic epilepsy (n= 5)]. We compared at single subject- and at group-level the IED-related fMRI maps obtained with and without additional regressors related to spontaneous movements. As secondary aim, we considered facial movements as events of interest to test the usefulness of video information to obtain fMRI maps of the following face movements: swallowing, mouth-tongue movements, and blinking. Results: Video information substantially improved the identification and classification of the artifacts with respect to the EEG observation alone (mean gain of 28 events per exam). Comparison with existing method: Inclusion of physiological activities as additional regressors in the GLM model demonstrated an increased Z-score and number of voxels of the global maxima and/or new BOLD clusters in around three quarters of the patients. Video-related fMRI maps for swallowing, mouth-tongue movements, and blinking were comparable to the ones obtained in previous task-based fMRI studies. Conclusions: Video acquisition during EEG-fMRI is a useful source of information. Modeling physiological movements in EEG-fMRI studies for epilepsy will lead to more informative IED-related fMRI maps in different epileptic conditions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Children with specific language impairment (SLI) experience great difficulties in language comprehension and/or production whereby the majority of these children have particular problems in acquiring syntactic rules. In the speech stream boundaries of major syntactic constituents are reliably marked by prosodic cues. Therefore, prosodic information provides an important cue for discovering the syntactic structure of a language [Jusczyk, P.W., 2002. How infants adapt speech-processing capacities to native language structure. Curr. Dir. Psychol. Sci. 11, 15-18.]. Following this, the question is, whether children with SLI differ in the processing of syntactic information from normally developing children and to what extent this is related to the processing of the inherent prosodic information. Children heard either correct sentences or sentences with a word category violation (syntactic level) and a joined prosodic incongruity (prosodic level) while event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Judging the sentence's correctness, control children performed better than children with SLI for all types of sentences. With respect to the ERPs, control children showed a bilateral early starting anterior negativity sustaining into a late anterior negativity and a P600 in posterior regions in response to incorrect sentences. Children with SLI showed a comparable P600 but unlike the control children there was only a late, clearly left lateralized anterior negativity. The complete absence of a right anterior negativity in children with SLI suggests that they may not access prosodic information in the same way normal children do. The differences in prosodic processing may in turn hamper the development of syntactic processing skills as indicated by the absence of the syntax-related early left anterior negativity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current study used event-related brain potentials to investigate lexical-semantic processing of words in sentences spoken by children with specific language impairment and children with normal language development. Children heard correct sentences and sentences with a violation of the selectional restriction of the verb. Control children showed an N400 effect followed by a late positivity for the incorrect sentences. In contrast, children with specific language impairment showed no N400 effect but did show a late, broadly distributed positivity. This absence of the N400 effect is due to a relatively large negativity for correct sentences, suggesting weaker lexical-semantic representations of the verbs and their selectional restrictions in children with specific language impairment. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Background: High intracranial pressure (ICP) is the most frequent cause of death and disability after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is usually treated with general maneuvers (normothermia, sedation, etc.) and a set of first-line therapeutic measures (moderate hypocapnia, mannitol, etc.). When these measures fail, second-line therapies are initiated, which include: barbiturates, hyperventilation, moderate hypothermia, or removal of a variable amount of skull bone (secondary decompressive craniectomy). Objectives: To assess the effects of secondary decompressive craniectomy (DC) on outcomes of patients with severe TBI in whom conventional medical therapeutic measures have failed to control raised ICP. Search methods: The most recent search was run on 8 December 2019. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), Embase Classic + Embase (OvidSP) and ISI Web of Science (SCI-EXPANDED &amp; CPCI-S). We also searched trials registries and contacted experts. Selection criteria: We included randomized studies assessing patients over the age of 12 months with severe TBI who either underwent DC to control ICP refractory to conventional medical treatments or received standard care. Data collection and analysis: We selected potentially relevant studies from the search results, and obtained study reports. Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies and assessed risk of bias. We used a random-effects model for meta-analysis. We rated the quality of the evidence according to the GRADE approach. Main results: We included three trials (590 participants). One single-site trial included 27 children; another multicenter trial (three countries) recruited 155 adults, the third trial was conducted in 24 countries, and recruited 408 adolescents and adults. Each study compared DC combined with standard care (this could include induced barbiturate coma or cooling of the brain, or both). All trials measured outcomes up to six months after injury; one also measured outcomes at 12 and 24 months (the latter data remain unpublished). All trials were at a high risk of bias for the criterion of performance bias, as neither participants nor personnel could be blinded to these interventions. The pediatric trial was at a high risk of selection bias and stopped early; another trial was at risk of bias because of atypical inclusion criteria and a change to the primary outcome after it had started. Mortality: pooled results for three studies provided moderate quality evidence that risk of death at six months was slightly reduced with DC (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.01; 3 studies, 571 participants; I2 = 38%; moderate-quality evidence), and one study also showed a clear reduction in risk of death at 12 months (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.76; 1 study, 373 participants; high-quality evidence). Neurological outcome: conscious of controversy around the traditional dichotomization of the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scale, we chose to present results in three ways, in order to contextualize factors relevant to clinical/patient decision-making. First, we present results of death in combination with vegetative status, versus other outcomes. Two studies reported results at six months for 544 participants. One employed a lower ICP threshold than the other studies, and showed an increase in the risk of death/vegetative state for the DC group. The other study used a more conventional ICP threshold, and results favoured the DC group (15.7% absolute risk reduction (ARR) (95% CI 6% to 25%). The number needed to treat for one beneficial outcome (NNTB) (i.e. to avoid death or vegetative status) was seven. The pooled result for DC compared with standard care showed no clear benefit for either group (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.13; 2 studies, 544 participants; I2 = 86%; low-quality evidence). One study reported data for this outcome at 12 months, when the risk for death or vegetative state was clearly reduced by DC compared with medical treatment (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.86; 1 study, 373 participants; high-quality evidence). Second, we assessed the risk of an 'unfavorable outcome' evaluated on a non-traditional dichotomized GOS-Extended scale (GOS-E), that is, grouping the category 'upper severe disability' into the 'good outcome' grouping. Data were available for two studies (n = 571). Pooling indicated little difference between DC and standard care regarding the risk of an unfavorable outcome at six months following injury (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.63; 544 participants); heterogeneity was high, with an I2 value of 82%. One trial reported data at 12 months and indicated a clear benefit of DC (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.95; 373 participants). Third, we assessed the risk of an 'unfavorable outcome' using the (traditional) dichotomized GOS/GOS-E cutoff into 'favorable' versus 'unfavorable' results. There was little difference between DC and standard care at six months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.40; 3 studies, 571 participants; low-quality evidence), and heterogeneity was high (I2 = 78%). At 12 months one trial suggested a similar finding (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09; 1 study, 373 participants; high-quality evidence). With regard to ICP reduction, pooled results for two studies provided moderate quality evidence that DC was superior to standard care for reducing ICP within 48 hours (MD −4.66 mmHg, 95% CI −6.86 to −2.45; 2 studies, 182 participants; I2 = 0%). Data from the third study were consistent with these, but could not be pooled. Data on adverse events are difficult to interpret, as mortality and complications are high, and it can be difficult to distinguish between treatment-related adverse events and the natural evolution of the condition. In general, there was low-quality evidence that surgical patients experienced a higher risk of adverse events. Authors' conclusions: Decompressive craniectomy holds promise of reduced mortality, but the effects of long-term neurological outcome remain controversial, and involve an examination of the priorities of participants and their families. Future research should focus on identifying clinical and neuroimaging characteristics to identify those patients who would survive with an acceptable quality of life; the best timing for DC; the most appropriate surgical techniques; and whether some synergistic treatments used with DC might improve patient outcomes.

AB  - High-functioning individuals with autism have been found to favor visuospatial processing in the face of typically poor language abilities. We aimed to examine the neurobiological basis of this difference using functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. We compared 12 children with high functioning autism (HFA) to 12 age- and IQ-matched typically developing controls (CTRL) on a pictorial reasoning paradigm under three conditions: V, requiring visuospatial processing; S, requiring language (i.e., semantic) processing; and V+S, a hybrid condition in which language use could facilitate visuospatial transformations. Activated areas in the brain were chosen as endpoints for probabilistic diffusion tractography to examine tract integrity (FA) within the structural network underlying the activation patterns. The two groups showed similar networks, with linguistic processing activating inferior frontal, superior and middle temporal, ventral visual, and temporo-parietal areas, whereas visuospatial processing activated occipital and inferior parietal cortices. However, HFA appeared to activate occipito-parietal and ventral temporal areas, whereas CTRL relied more on frontal and temporal language regions. The increased reliance on visuospatial abilities in HFA was supported by intact connections between the inferior parietal and the ventral temporal ROIs. In contrast, the inferior frontal region showed reduced connectivity to ventral temporal and middle temporal areas in this group, reflecting impaired activation of frontal language areas in autism. The HFA group's engagement of posterior brain regions along with its weak connections to frontal language areas suggest support for a reliance on visual mediation in autism, even in tasks of higher cognition. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: The genetic and environmental influences on prefrontal function in childhood are underinvestigated due to the difficulty of measuring prefrontal function in young subjects, for which near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a suitable functional neuroimaging technique that facilitates the easy and noninvasive measurement of blood oxygenation in the superficial cerebral cortices. Method: Using a two-channel NIRS arrangement, we measured changes in bilateral prefrontal blood oxygenation during a category version of the verbal fluency task (VFT) in 27 monozygotic twin pairs and 12 same-sex dizygotic twin pairs ages 5–17 years. We also assessed the participant's full-scale intelligence quotient (FIQ) and retrieved parental socioeconomic status (SES). Classical structured equation modeling was used to estimate the heritability. Results: The heritability of VFT-related brain activation was estimated to be 44% and 37% in the right and left prefrontal regions, respectively. We also identified a significant genetic contribution (74%) to FIQ, but did not to VFT task performance. Parental SES was not correlated with FIQ, task performance, or task-related prefrontal activation. Conclusions: This finding provides further evidence that variance in prefrontal function has a genetic component since childhood and highlights brain function, as measured by NIRS, as a promising candidate for endophenotyping neurodevelopmental disorders. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The neural basis of autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) is poorly understood. Studies of mnemonic function in ASD suggest a profile of impaired episodic memory with relative preservation of semantic memory (at least in high-functioning individuals). Such a pattern is consistent with developmental hippocampal abnormality. However, imaging evidence for abnormality of the hippocampal formation in ASD is inconsistent. These inconsistencies led us to examine the memory profile of children with ASD and the relationship to structural abnormalities. A cohort of high-functioning individuals with ASD and matched controls completed a comprehensive neuropsychological memory battery and underwent magnetic resonance imaging for the purpose of voxel-based morphometric analyses. Correlations between cognitive/behavioural test scores and quantified results of brain scans were also carried out to further examine the role of the medial temporal lobe in ASD. A selective deficit in episodic memory with relative preservation of semantic memory was found. Voxel-based morphometry revealed bilateral abnormalities in several areas implicated in ASD including the hippocampal formation. A significant correlation was found between parental ratings reflecting autistic symptomatology and the measure of grey matter density in the junction area involving the amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. The data reveal a pattern of impaired and relatively preserved mnemonic function that is consistent with a hippocampal abnormality of developmental origin. The structural imaging data highlight abnormalities in several brain regions previously implicated in ASD, including the medial temporal lobes. © Federation of European Neuroscience Societies.

AB  - Background: We have obtained previous evidence of limbic dysfunction in middle-Aged, asymptomatic offspring of lateonset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) patients, and failure to recover from proactive semantic interference has been shown to be a sensitive cognitive test in other groups at risk for LOAD. Objective: To assess the effects of specific proactive semantic interference deficits as they relate to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neocortical and limbic functional connectivity in middle aged offspring of individuals with LOAD (O-LOAD) and age-equivalent controls. Methods:We examined 21O-LOADand 20 controls without family history of neurodegenerative disorders (CS) on traditional measures of cognitive functioning and the LASSI-L, a novel semantic interference test uniquely sensitive to the failure to recover from proactive interference (frPSI). Cognitive tests then were correlated to fMRI connectivity of seeds located in entorhinal cortex and anterodorsal thalamic nuclei among O-LOAD and CS participants. Results: Relative to CS, O-LOAD participants evidenced lower connectivity between entorhinal cortex and orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, and anterior temporal cortex. In the offspring of LOAD patients, LASSI-L measures of frPSI were inversely associated with connectivity between anterodorsal thalamus and contralateral posterior cingulate. Intrusions on the task related to frPSI were inversely correlated with a widespread connectivity network involving hippocampal, insular, posterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, along with precunei and anterior thalamus in this group. Different patterns of connectivity associated with frPSI were observed among controls. Conclusion: The present results suggest that both semantic interference deficits and connectivity abnormalities might reflect limbic circuit dysfunction as a very early clinical signature of LOAD pathology, as previously demonstrated for other limbic phenotypes, such as sleep and circadian alterations.

AB  - The developmental amnesia is a recently known entity that occurs as a consequence of hypoxic-ischemic events in the perinatal period. This is a specific deficit of episodic memory with greater preservation of semantic memory and other memory components such as the immediate and working memory. It occurs in patients without apparent neurological sequelae, with normal psychomotor development and general intelligence. The developmental amnesia has been associated with bilateral involvement of the hippocampus, which is evident in some cases on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as signal disturbance and signs of atrophy, or reduced size of the hippocampus in brain volumetric studies. We present six observations of developmental amnesia, their clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings. All of them show impaired episodic memory with preservation of semantic memory, have a normal general intelligence and follow a regular school with special educational needs. It is necessary to keep in mind this entity in monitoring risk newborns by their perinatal history and include the exploration of memory in neuropsychological study of these subjects. On the other hand, we highlight the specificity of the clinical and neuropsychological profile for the diagnosis of developmental amnesia even in the absence of hippocampal lesions on conventional MRI.

These same regions were recruited in 13 children aged 6-11 years when they listened to sections of a story describing a character's thoughts compared to sections of the same story that described the physical context. A distinct region in the posterior superior temporal sulcus was implicated in the perception of biological motion. Change in response selectivity with age was observed in just one region. The right temporo-parietal junction was recruited equally for mental and physical facts about people in younger children, but only for mental facts in older children. © 2009, Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

AB  - Recent data suggest recovery of language systems but persistent structural abnormalities in the prematurely born. We tested the hypothesis that subjects who were born prematurely develop alternative networks for processing language. Subjects who were born prematurely (n 22; 6001250 g birth weight), without neonatal brain injury on neonatal cranial ultrasound, and 26 term control subjects were examined with a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) semantic association task, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III (WISC-III) and the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF). In-magnet task accuracy and response times were calculated, and fMRI data were evaluated for the effect of group on blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation, the correlation between task accuracy and activation and the functional connectivity between regions activating to task. Although there were differences in verbal IQ and CELF scores between the preterm (PT) and term control groups, there were no significant differences for either accuracy or response time for the in-magnet task. Both groups activated classic semantic processing areas including the left superior and middle temporal gyri and inferior frontal gyrus, and there was no significant difference in activation patterns between groups. Clear differences between the groups were observed in the correlation between task accuracy and activation to task at P < 0.01, corrected for multiple comparisons. Left inferior frontal gyrus correlated with accuracy only for term controls and left sensory motor areas correlated with accuracy only for PT subjects. Left middle temporal gyri correlated with task accuracy for both groups. Connectivity analyses at P < 0.001 revealed the importance of a circuit between left middle temporal gyri and inferior frontal gyrus for both groups. In addition, the PT subjects evidenced greater connectivity between traditional language areas and sensory motor areas but significantly fewer correlated areas within the frontal lobes when compared to term controls. We conclude that at 12 years of age, children born prematurely and children born at term had no difference in performance on a simple lexical semantic processing task and activated similar areas. Connectivity analyses, however, suggested that PT subjects rely upon different neural pathways for lexical semantic processing when compared to term controls. Plasticity in network connections may provide the substrate for improving language skills in the prematurely born.

AB  - Although category-specific activation for faces in the ventral visual pathway appears adult-like in adolescence, recognition abilities for individual faces are still immature. We investigated how the ability to represent individual faces and houses develops at the neural level. Category-selective regions of interest (ROIs) for faces in the fusiform gyrus (FG) and for places in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) were identified individually in children, adolescents, and adults. Then, using an functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation paradigm, we measured category selectivity and individual-level adaptation for faces and houses in each ROI. Only adults exhibited both category selectivity and individual-level adaptation bilaterally for faces in the FG and for houses in the PPA. Adolescents showed category selectivity bilaterally for faces in the FG and houses in the PPA. Despite this profile of category selectivity, adolescents only exhibited individual-level adaptation for houses bilaterally in the PPA and for faces in the left FG. Children only showed category-selective responses for houses in the PPA, and they failed to exhibit category-selective responses for faces in the FG and individual-level adaptation effects anywhere in the brain. These results indicate that category-level neural tuning develops prior to individual-level neural tuning and that face-related cortex is disproportionately slower in this developmental transition than is place-related cortex. © 2011 The Author.

AB  - The organization of category-selective regions in ventral visual cortex is well characterized in human adults. We investigated a crucial, previously unaddressed, question about how this organization emerges developmentally. We contrasted the developmental trajectories for face-, object-, and place-selective activation in the ventral visual cortex in children, adolescents, and adults. Although children demonstrated adult-like organization in object- and place-related cortex, as a group they failed to show consistent face-selective activation in classical face regions. The lack of a consistent neural signature for faces was attributable to (1) reduced face-selectivity and extent of activation within the regions that will become the FFA, OFA, and STS in adults, and (2) smaller volumes and considerable variability in the locus of face-selective activation in individual children. In contrast, adolescents showed an adult-like pattern of face-selective activation, although it was more right-lateralized. These findings reveal critical age-related differences in the emergence of category-specific functional organization in the visual cortex and support a model of brain development in which specialization emerges from interactions between experience-dependent learning and the maturing brain. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - The application of elaborative encoding strategies during learning, such as grouping items on similar semantic categories, increases the likelihood of later recall. Previous studies have suggested that stimuli that encourage semantic grouping strategies had modulating effects on specific ERP components. However, these studies did not differentiate between ERP activation patterns evoked by elaborative working memory strategies like semantic grouping and more simple strategies like rote rehearsal. Identification of neurocognitive correlates underlying successful use of elaborative strategies is important to understand better why certain populations, like children or elderly people, have problems applying such strategies. To compare ERP activation during the application of elaborative versus more simple strategies subjects had to encode either four semantically related or unrelated pictures by respectively applying a semantic category grouping or a simple rehearsal strategy. Another goal was to investigate if maintenance of semantically grouped vs. ungrouped pictures modulated ERP-slow waves differently. At the behavioral level there was only a semantic grouping benefit in terms of faster responding on correct rejections (i.e. when the memory probe stimulus was not part of the memory set). At the neural level, during encoding semantic grouping only had a modest specific modulatory effect on a fronto-central Late Positive Component (LPC), emerging around 650. ms. Other ERP components (i.e. P200, N400 and a second Late Positive Component) that had been earlier related to semantic grouping encoding processes now showed stronger modulation by rehearsal than by semantic grouping. During maintenance semantic grouping had specific modulatory effects on left and right frontal slow wave activity. These results stress the importance of careful control of strategy use when investigating the neural correlates of elaborative encoding. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Theoretical models for lexical access to visual objects have been based mainly on adult data. To investigate the developmental aspects of object recognition and lexical access in children, a large-scale functional MRI (fMRI) study was performed in 283 normal children ages 5-18 using a word-picture matching paradigm in which children would match an aurally presented noun to one of two pictures (line drawings). Using group Independent Component Analysis (ICA), six task-related components were detected, including (a) the posterior superior temporal gyrus bilaterally; (b) the fusiform, inferior temporal, and middle occipital gyri bilaterally; (c) the dorsal aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally, the left precuneus, the left superior/middle temporal gyrus, and the anterior cingulate; (d) the right medial fusiform gyrus; (e) a left-lateralized component including the inferior/middle frontal, middle temporal, medial frontal, and angular gyri, as well as the thalamus and the posterior cingulate; and (f) the ventral/anterior aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally. Increased activation associated with age was seen in the components (b) and (d) (ventral visual pathway) for object recognition, and (c) and (f) likely associated with semantic maintenance and response selection. Increased activation associated with task performance was seen in components (b) and (d) (ventral visual pathway) while decreased activation associated with task performance was seen in component (f) (ventral/anterior inferior frontal gyrus). The results corroborate the continued development of the ventral visual pathway throughout the developmental period. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AU  - Schmitt, B.M.
AU  - Lamers, M.

T2  - Cognitive Brain Research
AB  - During comprehension, a personal pronoun (he, she, it) refers to a preceding referent (boy, girl, child). This co-reference could be established, among other ways, by using (i) conceptual/semantic information (biological gender agreement between the pronoun and its referent), (ii) syntactic information (syntactic gender agreement), or (iii) both. This event-related brain potential (ERP) study assesses this interplay of syntactic and semantic information. We focussed on the N400 component, related to semantic integration, and the SPS/P600 component, related to syntactic reanalysis. The study was conducted in German, because its rich syntactic gender system offers a means to dissociate between biological (MALE/FEMALE) and syntactic gender (masculine/feminine/neuter), especially in the case of diminutives (dasneuter BübchenMALE [the little boy]). German subjects read sentences in which a referent (BübchenMALE-neuter/BubMALE-masculine [boy]) was introduced. Later a personal pronoun was presented which either agreed with the referent in terms of syntactic gender, or in terms of biological gender, or both, or violated both agreements. Overall, results showed salient P600 effects for pronouns. This indicates that the establishment of reference involves syntactic reanalysis. Furthermore, we observed N400 effects in sentences with non-diminutives, but not with diminutives. This shows that conceptual/semantic integration is involved during non-diminutive but not during diminutive pronoun processing, or at least it could not be violated. The overall pattern of results supports the claim that for non-diminutives, both syntactic and conceptual information is used to establish co-reference, while for diminutives the process might be purely syntactically driven. © Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Although very young children seem to process ongoing language quickly and effortlessly, neuroimaging and behavioral studies reveal that children continue to mature in their language skills through adolescence. During this prolonged development, children likely engage the same basic cognitive processes and neural mechanisms to perform language tasks as adults, but in somewhat different ways. In this study we used time frequency analysis of EEG to identify developmental differences in the engagement of neural oscillations between children (ages 10–12) and adults while listening to naturally-paced sentences. Adults displayed consistent beta changes throughout the sentence compared to children, thought to be related to efficient syntactic integration, and children displayed more broadly distributed theta changes than adults, thought to be related to more effortful semantic integration. Few differences in alpha, related to verbal working memory, existed between groups. These findings shed new light on developmental changes in the neuronal processes underlying language comprehension. © 2018

We have previously identified fMRI- and ERP-based neural markers of impaired sentence reading in dyslexia that indicated both deviant basic word processing and deviant semantic incongruency processing. However, it remained unclear how specific these impairments are for dyslexia, as they occurred when children with dyslexia (DYS) were compared to chronological age-matched controls (CA) who also differ in the amount of reading experience. Adding a younger control group at a similar reading level (RL) as the dyslexic group, we examined here which of these markers would be specific for dyslexia despite matched performance, and which would resemble a developmental delay. Both the RL group and the DYS group showed a similar reversal of incongruency effects in the inferior parietal region (fMRI data) and similarly reduced incongruency effects around 400 ms (ERP data) compared to the CA group, suggesting that the semantic impairment in dyslexia resembles a developmental delay. Furthermore, the DYS group showed reduced sentence reading-related activation in the inferior parietal cortex in the fMRI data, and at around 100 ms (trend) and 400 ms in the ERP data when compared to both CA and RL groups, suggesting dyslexia-specific deficits in basic word processing during sentence reading. Low reading skills due to young age and due to dyslexia-specific word processing deficits thus reflect different pathways which impair semantic processing in similar ways. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a specific disorder of reading acquisition characterized by a phonological core deficit. Sentence reading is also impaired in dyslexic readers, but whether semantic processing deficits contribute is unclear. Combining spatially and temporally sensitive neuroimaging techniques to focus on semantic processing can provide a more comprehensive characterization of sentence reading in dyslexia. We recorded brain activity from 52 children (16 with dyslexia, 31 controls) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERP) in two separate counterbalanced sessions. The children silently read and occasionally judged simple sentences with semantically congruous or incongruous endings. fMRI and ERP activation during sentence reading and semantic processing was analyzed across all children and also by comparing children with dyslexia to controls. For sentence reading, we analyzed the response to all words in a sentence; for semantic processing, we contrasted responses to incongruous and congruous endings. Sentence reading was characterized by activation in a left-lateralized language network. Semantic processing was characterized by activation in left-hemispheric regions of the inferior frontal and superior temporal cortex and by an electrophysiological N400 effect after 240 ms with consistent left anterior source localization. Children with dyslexia showed decreased activation for sentence reading in inferior parietal and frontal regions, and for semantic processing in inferior parietal regions, and during the N400 effect. Together, this suggests that semantic impairment during sentence reading reduces dyslexic children's response in left anterior brain regions underlying the more phasic N400 effect and subsequently modulates the more sustained BOLD response in left inferior parietal regions. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The ability to recognize the difference among faces of another race or species declines from 6 to 9 months of age. During this time, perceptual biases are formed, leading to lasting deficits in recognizing individuals of other races and species. However, little is known about how early infant experience shapes the neural structures underlying face processing. Here we found neural specialization, in infants who received 3 months of training with six individually labeled monkey faces. However, neural specialization was not found after an equal amount of training with the same six faces labeled at the category-level (i.e., all faces labeled " monkey") or when infants were exposed to faces without labels. These results suggest that neural specialization for faces requires learning at the individual level during infancy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Children learn the words for above–below relations earlier than for left–right relations, despite treating these equally well in a simple visual categorization task. Even as adults—conflicts in congruency, such as when a stimulus is depicted in a spatially incongruent manner with respect to salient global cues—can be challenging. Here we investigated the neural correlates of encoding and maintaining in working memory above–below and left–right relational planes in 12 adults using magnetoencephalography in order to discover whether above–below relations are represented by the brain differently than left–right relations. Adults performed perfectly on the task behaviorally, so any differences in neural activity were attributed to the stimuli’s cognitive attributes. In comparing above–below to left–right relations during stimulus encoding, we found the greatest differences in neural activity in areas associated with space and movement. In comparing congruent to incongruent trials, we found the greatest differential activity in premotor areas. For both contrasts, brain areas involved in the encoding phase were also involved in the maintenance phase, which provides evidence that those brain areas are particularly important in representing the relational planes or congruency types throughout the trial. When comparing neural activity associated with the relational planes during working memory, additional right posterior areas were implicated, whereas the congruent-incongruent contrast implicated additional bilateral frontal and temporal areas. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis left–right relations are represented differently than above–below relations. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).

AB  - Human infants' complete dependence on adult caregiving suggests that mechanisms associated with adult responsiveness to infant cues might be deeply embedded in the brain. Behavioural and neuroimaging research has produced converging evidence for adults' positive disposition to infant cues, but these studies have not investigated directly the valence of adults' reactions, how they are moderated by biological and social factors, and if they relate to child caregiving. This study examines implicit affective responses of 90 adults toward faces of human and non-human (cats and dogs) infants and adults. Implicit reactions were assessed with Single Category Implicit Association Tests, and reports of childrearing behaviours were assessed by the Parental Style Questionnaire. The results showed that human infant faces represent highly biologically relevant stimuli that capture attention and are implicitly associated with positive emotions. This reaction holds independent of gender and parenthood status and is associated with ideal parenting behaviors.

AB  - Infants younger than 20 months of age interpret both words and symbolic gestures as object names. Later in development words and gestures take on divergent communicative functions. Here, we examined patterns of brain activity to words and gestures in typically developing infants at 18 and 26 months of age. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a match/mismatch task. At 18 months, an N400 mismatch effect was observed for pictures preceded by both words and gestures. At 26 months the N400 effect was limited to words. The results provide the first neurobiological evidence showing developmental changes in semantic processing of gestures. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested atypically enhanced activity of visual cortex during language processing in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, it remains unclear whether visual cortical participation reflects isolated processing within posterior regions or functional cooperation with distal brain regions, such as left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). We addressed this question using functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) and structural equation modeling in 14 adolescents and adults with ASD and 14 matched typically developing (TD) participants. Data were analyzed to isolate low-frequency intrinsic fluctuations, by regressing out effects of a semantic decision task. For a right extrastriate seed derived from the strongest cluster of atypical activation in the ASD group, widespread effects of increased connectivity in prefrontal and medial frontal lobes bilaterally were observed for the ASD group, compared to the TD group. A second analysis for a seed in LIFG, derived from pooled activation effects in both groups, also yielded widespread effects of overconnectivity in the ASD group, especially in temporal lobes. Structural equation modeling showed that whereas right extrastriate cortex did not impact function of language regions (left and right IFG, left middle temporal gyrus) in the TD model, it was an integral part of a language circuit in the ASD group. These results suggest that atypical extrastriate activation during language processing in ASD reflects integrative (not isolated) processing. Furthermore, our findings are inconsistent with previous reports of functional underconnectivity in ASD, probably related to removal of task effects required to isolate intrinsic low-frequency fluctuations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

T2  - Developmental psychology
AB  - Behavioral investigations of the acquisition of some have shown that children favor its logical interpretation (some and possibly all). Adults, however, use the pragmatic interpretation (some but not all) derived by a scalar implicature. Certain experimental manipulations increase children's rates of adult-like responses, indicating that children are capable of computing implicatures. A functional MRI (fMRI) study examining adults linked the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) to implicature computation, and prefrontal regions, the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and medial frontal gyrus (MeFG), to processing the mismatch between implicatures and the context in which they were presented. In the current fMRI study, we aimed to determine whether children's failure to give pragmatic interpretations to some results from a failure in implicature computation or in implicature-mismatch processing. We explored children's brain activations with the same experimental task administered to adults. In a region-of-interest analysis, children showed an activational pattern similar to the one observed in adults in the left IFG with increased activations for the implicature conditions. By contrast, in the left MFG, children showed decreased activation for the mismatched implicatures compared with matched and no implicature conditions. No difference between the conditions was observed in the MeFG. For both implicature conditions, no activation in the left IFG was observed when comparing adults and children directly. However, for mismatched implicatures, adults showed greater activation in the prefrontal regions compared with children. Our results suggest that children may have an adult-like computation of implicatures (even when their behavior does not necessarily indicate that), but they fail in resolving implicature-mismatch situations.

AB  - In adults, the most common expansile “mass” lesion in the posterior fossa is a subacute stroke, whereas the most common neoplastic lesion in the posterior fossa is cerebellar metastasis (intra-axial) or vestibular schwannoma (extra-axial). Those diseases fall outside the scope of this article, which focuses on primary intra-axial tumors of the posterior fossa in adults. This category of tumors is uncommon and more frequently encountered in children. This article reviews tumors of the cerebellum, brainstem, and fourth ventricle that are seen in adult patients, following categories from the 2007 World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors. © 2016

AB  - Traumatic brain injury is a common cause of death and disability in children; early neuroimaging has assumed an increasingly important role in evaluating the extent and severity of injury. Several imaging methods were assessed in a study of 40 children with traumatic brain injury: computed tomography (CT), T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI, and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) MRI to determine which were most valuable in predicting 6-12 month outcomes as classified by the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale score. Patients were subdivided into three groups: (1) normal, (2) mild disability, and (3) moderate/severe disability/persistent vegetative state. T2, FLAIR, and SWI showed no significant difference in lesion volume between normal and mild outcome groups, but did indicate significant differences between normal and poor and between mild and poor outcome groups. Computed tomography revealed no significant differences in lesion volume between any groups. The findings suggest that T2, FLAIR, and SWI MRI sequences provide a more accurate assessment of injury severity and detection of outcome-influencing lesions than does CT in pediatric traumatic brain injury patients. Although CT was inconsistent at lesion detection/outcome prediction, it remains an essential part of the acute traumatic brain injury work-up to assess the need for neurosurgic intervention. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Behavioral studies have demonstrated that children develop a nearly adult-like grammar between 36 and 42 months, but few studies have addressed how the child's brain processes semantic versus syntactic information. In previous research, Silva-Pereyra and colleagues showed that distinct event-related potentials (ERPs) are elicited by semantic and syntactic violations in sentences in children as young as 30, 36, and 48 months, following the patterns displayed by adults. In the current study, we examined ERPs to syntactic phrase structure violations in real and jabberwocky sentences in 36-month-old children. Jabberwocky sentences are sentences in which content (open-class) words are replaced by pseudowords while function (closed-class) words are retained. Results showed that syntactically anomalous real sentences elicited two positive ERP effects: left-distributed effects from 500 to 750 msec and 1050 to 1300 msec, whereas syntactically anomalous jabberwocky sentences elicited two negative ERP effects: a left-distributed effect from 750 to 900 msec and a later broadly distributed effect from 950 to 1150 msec. The results indicate that when preschoolers process real English sentences, ERPs resembling the positive effects previously reported for adults are noted, although at longer latencies and with broader scalp distributions. However, when preschoolers process jabberwocky sentences with altered lexical-semantic content, a negative-going ERP component similar to one typically associated with the extraction of meaning is noted. © 2007 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is characterized by a severe reading problem in people who have normal intelligence and schooling. Impaired reading of alphabetic scripts is associated with dysfunction of left temporoparietal brain regions. These regions perform phonemic analysis and conversion of written symbols to phonological units of speech (grapheme–to–phoneme conversion); two central cognitive processes that mediate reading acquisition. Furthermore, it has been assumed that, in contrast to cultural diversities, dyslexia in different languages has a universal biological origin. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging with reading-impaired Chinese children and associated controls, that functional disruption of the left middle frontal gyrus is associated with impaired reading of the Chinese language (a logographic rather than alphabetic writing system). Reading impairment in Chinese is manifested by two deficits: one relating to the conversion of graphic form (orthography) to syllable, and the other concerning orthography–to–semantics mapping. Both of these processes are critically mediated by the left middle frontal gyrus, which functions as a centre for fluent Chinese reading that coordinates and integrates various information about written characters in verbal and spatial working memory. This finding provides an insight into the fundamental pathophysiology of dyslexia by suggesting that rather than having a universal origin, the biological abnormality of impaired reading is dependent on culture. © 2004 Nature publishing group.

AB  - An essential computational component of the human language faculty is syntax as it regulates how words are combined into sentences. Although its neuroanatomical basis is well-specified in adults, its emergence in the maturing brain is not yet understood. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a cross-sectional design, we discovered, that in contrast to what is known about adults 3-to-4- and 6-to-7-year-old children do not process syntax independently from semantics at the neural level already before these two types of information are integrated for the interpretation of a sentence. It is not until the end of the 10th year of life that children show a neural selectivity for syntax, segregated and gradually independent from semantics, in the left inferior frontal cortex as in the adult brain. Our results indicate that it takes until early adolescence for the domain-specific selectivity of syntax within the language network to develop. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Speech-associated gestures are hand and arm movements that not only convey semantic information to listeners but are themselves actions. Broca's area has been assumed to play an important role both in semantic retrieval or selection (as part of a language comprehension system) and in action recognition (as part of a "mirror" or "observation-execution matching" system). We asked whether the role that Broca's area plays in processing speech-associated gestures is consistent with the semantic retrieval/selection account (predicting relatively weak interactions between Broca's area and other cortical areas because the meaningful information that speech-associated gestures convey reduces semantic ambiguity and thus reduces the need for semantic retrieval/selection) or the action recognition account (predicting strong interactions between Broca's area and other cortical areas because speech-associated gestures are goal-direct actions that are "mirrored"). We compared the functional connectivity of Broca's area with other cortical areas when participants listened to stories while watching meaningful speech-associated gestures, speech-irrelevant self-grooming hand movements, or no hand movements. A network analysis of neuroimaging data showed that interactions involving Broca's area and other cortical areas were weakest when spoken language was accompanied by meaningful speech-associated gestures, and strongest when spoken language was accompanied by self-grooming hand movements or by no hand movements at all. Results are discussed with respect to the role that the human mirror system plays in processing speech-associated movements. © 2007.

AB  - The temporal lobes play a prominent role in declarative memory function, including episodic memory (memory for events) and semantic memory (memory for facts and concepts). Surgical resection for medication-resistant and well-localized temporal lobe epilepsy has good prognosis for seizure freedom, but is linked to memory difficulties in adults, especially when the removal is on the left side. Children may benefit most from surgery, because brain plasticity may facilitate post-surgical reorganization, and seizure cessation may promote cognitive development. However, the long-term impact of this intervention in children is not known. We examined memory function in 53 children (25 males, 28 females) who were evaluated for epilepsy surgery: 42 underwent unilateral temporal lobe resections (25 left, 17 right, mean age at surgery 13.8 years), 11 were treated only pharmacologically. Average follow-up was 9 years (range 5-15). Post-surgical change in visual and verbal episodic memory, and semantic memory at follow-up were examined. Pre- and post-surgical T1-weighted MRI brain scans were analysed to extract hippocampal and resection volumes, and evaluate post-surgical temporal lobe integrity. Language lateralization indices were derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging. There were no significant pre- to postoperative decrements in memory associated with surgery. In contrast, gains in verbal episodic memory were seen after right temporal lobe surgery, and visual episodic memory improved after left temporal lobe surgery, indicating a functional release in the unoperated temporal lobe after seizure reduction or cessation. Pre- to post-surgical change in memory function was not associated with any indices of brain structure derived from MRI. However, better verbal memory at follow-up was linked to greater post-surgical residual hippocampal volumes, most robustly in left surgical participants. Better semantic memory at follow-up was associated with smaller resection volumes and greater temporal pole integrity after left temporal surgery. Results were independent of post-surgical intellectual function and language lateralization. Our findings indicate post-surgical, hemisphere-dependent material-specific improvement in memory functions in the intact temporal lobe. However, outcome was linked to the anatomical integrity of the temporal lobe memory system, indicating that compensatory mechanisms are constrained by the amount of tissue which remains in the operated temporal lobe. Careful tailoring of resections for children undergoing epilepsy surgery may enhance long-term memory outcome. © The Author (2014).

AB  - Recent resting-state functional MRI investigations have demonstrated that much of the large-scale functional network architecture supporting motor, sensory and cognitive functions in older pediatric and adult populations is present in term- and prematurely-born infants. Application of new analytical approaches can help translate the improved understanding of early functional connectivity provided through these studies into predictive models of neurodevelopmental outcome. One approach to achieving this goal is multivariate pattern analysis, a machine-learning, pattern classification approach well-suited for high-dimensional neuroimaging data. It has previously been adapted to predict brain maturity in children and adolescents using structural and resting state-functional MRI data. In this study, we evaluated resting state-functional MRI data from 50 preterm-born infants (born at 23-29 weeks of gestation and without moderate-severe brain injury) scanned at term equivalent postmenstrual age compared with data from 50 term-born control infants studied within the first week of life. Using 214 regions of interest, binary support vector machines distinguished term from preterm infants with 84% accuracy (p < 0.0001). Inter- and intra-hemispheric connections throughout the brain were important for group categorization, indicating that widespread changes in the brain's functional network architecture associated with preterm birth are detectable by term equivalent age. Support vector regression enabled quantitative estimation of birth gestational age in single subjects using only term equivalent resting state-functional MRI data, indicating that the present approach is sensitive to the degree of disruption of brain development associated with preterm birth (using gestational age as a surrogate for the extent of disruption). This suggests that support vector regression may provide a means for predicting neurodevelopmental outcome in individual infants. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Some relationships between skills in word-category recall and factors in adults' aphasia
AU  - Sommers, R.K.
T2  - Perceptual and Motor Skills
AB  - It has long been recognized that a basic dimension to the lexical organization of the brain is semantic, and some brain mapping studies have indicated that the brain fields are distinctly different from some grammatical classes. Findings from the present investigation showed consistent relationships between 29 aphasic adults' performances on tasks involving graphic and gestural skills and those involving sequential recall of spoken words from different word categories. Each adult received the Porch Index of Communication Abilities which relies upon the physical manipulation of objects to assess verbal, gestural, and graphic abilities. Scores on a test requiring recall of word strings of nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, or prepositions were used to predict the subscale scores from the Graphic and Gestural factors of the index. Recall scores for verb and preposition were predictive of the aphasic subjects' performances on the Graphic subscale, and noun and preposition scores were predictors of subjects' scores on the Gestural subscale. The results are related to other research showing that verb and preposition skills are predictive of fine motor abilities of children with communication disorders and brain-mapping studies. Some discussion centers on possible overlapping functions of brain activity involving word categories, language, and fine motor skills.

AB  - The phonological deficit hypothesis of dyslexia has been investigated in the present research by analysing language-related lateralization of the EEG theta band in a sample of dyslexic children. To this aim, a paradigm based on word-pair visual presentation was used in which the same words were processed in Semantic and Phonological tasks. Theta band amplitude, a cortical index that has been related to working memory processing, was analysed during four different phases of word elaboration, thus allowing to measure also the temporal dynamics of word reading/encoding in the verbal working memory. Control subjects showed a specific (and therefore efficient) task-related and time-dependent cortical activation: a peak of theta activity during word reading was found that decayed during the next inter stimulus interval. Furthermore, during word presentation in the Phonological task, theta amplitude was greater on the left hemisphere. Dyslexics evidenced an altered pattern of theta activation both in the temporal dimension and in the cortical space: their peak of activity was delayed to the first inter stimulus interval after word offset and was shifted to the right hemisphere throughout the whole epoch of Phonological task and in two phases of the Semantic task. Analysis of alpha band failed to replicate the complex pattern of lateralization found for theta band in the two groups, a result that suggests a specific functional role of theta band, which cannot be interpreted as a simple marker of cortical inhibition. Results point to a deficit, in dyslexic children, to recruit left hemisphere structures for the elaboration of the phonological component of the verbal working memory. This deficit was marked by a different, unspecific and dysfunctional hemispherical asymmetry of theta activation to language, a deficit that involved also the time course of phonological linguistic elaboration. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Across species, kin bond together to promote survival. We sought to understand the dyadic effect of exclusion by kin (as opposed to non-kin strangers) on brain activity of the mother and her child and their subjective distress. To this end, we probed mother-child relationships with a computerized ball-toss game Cyberball. When excluded by one another, rather than by a stranger, both mothers and children exhibited a significantly pronounced frontal P2. Moreover, upon kin rejection versus stranger rejection, both mothers and children showed incremented left frontal positive slow waves for rejection events. Children reported more distress upon exclusion than their own mothers. Similar to past work, relatively augmented negative frontal slow wave activity predicted greater self-reported ostracism distress. This effect, generalized to the P2, was limited to mother- or child-rejection by kin, with comparable magnitude of effect across kin identity (mothers vs. children). For both mothers and children, the frontal P2 peak was significantly pronounced for kin rejection versus stranger rejection. Taken together, our results document the rapid categorization of social signals as kin relevant and the specificity of early and late neural markers for predicting felt ostracism. Kin rejection was examined by looking at neural responses in children and their mothers while playing the computer game Cyberball. Responses, specifically the frontal P2 and slow wave, were selectively greater for rejection by kin than by stranger. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the present voxel-based morphometry study was to examine the link between brain structure and number skills in a group of 6-7-year-old children born prematurely, which are considered to be an at-risk population for mathematical learning disabilities. Therefore, gray and white matter density values were extracted from brain areas previously reported to be relevant for number processing in developing brain systems and, thereafter, correlated with response time results tapping semantic number knowledge [i.e. numerical distance effect (NDE) derived from a number comparison task] as well as with general math proficiency (as indexed by a standardized calculation test). Behavioral results disclosed a significant NDE, thus indicating well-established number magnitude representations for one-digit numerals in our study group. Significant positive correlations between gray matter and NDE emerged in parietal regions (including the right anterior inferior and the left superior parietal lobe) and in the right superior temporal gyrus. Moreover, white matter and NDE were negatively correlated in the right anterior inferior parietal lobe and the right inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, our results are novel insofar as they show that in 6-7-year-old children born prematurely, individual differences in gray and white matter structures are associated with numerical skills. Importantly, in our study group the observed link between brain structure and behavioral performance emerges only regarding an experimental task tapping semantic number knowledge, whereas general math proficiency does not seem to be related to individual differences in brain structure in our study group. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether the four-factor category-based obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptom structure from a previous confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) may be appropriately used in child, adolescent, and adult groups. Symptom dimensions are increasingly used as quantitative traits in genetic, neuroimaging, and treatment studies of OCD across all ages. Identification of a category-based OCD symptom dimension structure that is validated for use across child, adolescent, and adult age groups is necessary to guide ongoing translational research. Method: Four OCD samples comprising 356 individuals were divided into child, adolescent, and adult groups. The fit of the only CFA-defined four-factor model was compared across these independent age group samples. Multiple-group CFA using maximum likelihood estimation assessed adequacy of fit comparing unconstrained and measurement weight-constrained models. The fit of previous exploratory factor analysis-defined three- and five-factor models on adults was also examined using CFA. Results: A four-factor solution provided adequate but imperfect fit across age groups, with comparable indices to the only previous OCD CFA: factor 1 (aggressive/sexual/religious/somatic/checking); factor 2 (symmetry/ordering/ counting/ repeating); factor 3 (contamination/cleaning), and factor 4 (hoarding). Models in which factor loadings were constrained and unconstrained across the three age groups yielded comparable model fit. Factors were highly correlated and were not mutually exclusive. The four-factor solution provided an improved fit to both three- and five-factor solutions using CFA across the three age groups. Conclusions: A four-factor, CFA-defined, category-based model of OCD symptom dimensions is adequate for use in children, adolescents, and adult age groups. The factor structure of this multiple age group sample has limitations and is imperfect, but current findings support the comparability of the defined latent OCD dimensions across age groups. Further work is needed to optimize a comprehensive symptom dimension model reflecting clinical heterogeneity for use in emergent translational studies. © 2008 by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

AB  - The Stroop task was used to investigate the role of phonological processing in semantic access for written Chinese language. Fourteen children were recruited to perform the Stroop task, using color characters, their homophones and neutral characters as stimuli. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to measure the brain activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the task. In view of better sensitivity, oxy-hemoglobin was chosen to indicate the task activation. In behavioral performance, there was a significant classical Stroop interference effect as indexed by longer response time and higher error rate for the color task than the neutral task, whereas there was no evident interference effect for the color homophones. The NIRS data agreed with the behavioral data, and showed a significant Stroop effect only for the color characters in the bilateral PFC. These results suggested that phonology may not play an important role in semantic activation of Chinese characters for children. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Objective: Language skills continue to develop rapidly in children during the school-age years, and the "snapshot" view of the neural substrates of language provided by current neuroimaging studies cannot capture the dynamic changes associated with brain development. The aim of this study was to conduct a 5-year longitudinal investigation of language development using functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy children. Methods: Thirty subjects enrolled at ages 5, 6, or 7 were examined annually for 5 years using a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner and a verb generation task. Data analysis was conducted based on a general linear model that was modified to investigate developmental changes whereas minimizing the potential for missing data. Results: With increasing age, there is progressive participation in language processing by the inferior/middle frontal, middle temporal, and angular gyri of the left hemisphere and the lingual and inferior temporal gyri of the right hemisphere and regression of participation of the left posterior insula/extrastriate cortex, left superior frontal and right anterior cingulate gyri, and left thalamus. Interpretation: The age-related changes observed in this study provide evidence of increased neuroplasticity of language in this age group and may have implications for further investigations of normal and aberrant language development. © 2006 American Neurological Association.

AB  - We investigated the effects of non-native language (English) exposure on event-related potentials (ERPs) in first- and second-year (four- and five-year-old) preschool Japanese native speakers while they listened to semantically congruent and incongruent Japanese sentences. The children were divided into a non-native language exposed group (exposed group) and a group without such experiences (control group) on the basis of their exposure to non-native language. We compared the ERPs recorded from the two groups in each of the two preschool years. N400 was observed both in the first- and second-year preschoolers. Differences owing to exposure to non-native language appeared in the second-year preschoolers but not in the first-year preschoolers. In the second-year preschoolers, the N400 onset in the exposed group was shorter than that in the control group, but there was no difference in the N400 offset between the exposed and control groups. Furthermore, the scalp distribution of the N400 in the exposed group was broader than that in the control group. These results indicate that the time course and scalp distribution of semantic processing for native language sentences in young children fluctuated depending on exposure to non-native language. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

AB  - Memory representations of words are thought to undergo changes with consolidation: Episodic memories of novel words are transformed into lexical representations that interact with other words in the mental dictionary. Behavioral studies have shown that this lexical integration process is enhanced when there is more time for consolidation. Neuroimaging studies have further revealed that novel word representations are initially represented in a hippocampally-centered system, whereas left posterior middle temporal cortex activation increases with lexicalization. In this study, we measured behavioral and brain responses to newly-learned words in children. Two groups of Dutch children, aged between 8–10 and 14–16 years, were trained on 30 novel Japanese words depicting novel concepts. Children were tested on word-forms, word-meanings, and the novel words’ influence on existing word processing immediately after training, and again after a week. In line with the adult findings, hippocampal involvement decreased with time. Lexical integration, however, was not observed immediately or after a week, neither behaviorally nor neurally. It appears that time alone is not always sufficient for lexical integration to occur. We suggest that other factors (e.g., the novelty of the concepts and familiarity with the language the words are derived from)might also influence the integration process. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Objective: In patients with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), interictal ripples (80–250Hz) are observed in large brain areas whose resection may be unnecessary for seizure freedom. This limits their utility as epilepsy biomarkers for surgery. We assessed the spatiotemporal propagation of interictal ripples on intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in children with MRE, compared it with the propagation of spikes, identified ripples that initiated propagation (onset-ripples), and evaluated their clinical value as epilepsy biomarkers. Methods: Twenty-seven children who underwent epilepsy surgery were studied. We identified propagation sequences of ripples and spikes across multiple iEEG contacts and calculated each ripple or spike latency from the propagation onset. We classified ripples and spikes into categories (ie, onset, spread, and isolated) based on their spatiotemporal characteristics and correlated their mean rate inside and outside resection with outcome (good outcome, Engel 1 versus poor outcome, Engel≥2). We determined, as onset-zone, spread-zone, and isolated-zone, the areas generating the corresponding ripple or spike category and evaluated the predictive value of their resection. Results: We observed ripple propagation in all patients and spike propagation in 25 patients. Mean rate of onset-ripples inside resection predicted the outcome (odds ratio = 5.37; p = 0.02) and correlated with Engel class (rho = −0.55; p = 0.003). Resection of the onset-ripple-zone was associated with good outcome (p = 0.047). No association was found for the spread-ripple-zone, isolated-ripple-zone, or any spike-zone. Interpretation: Interictal ripples propagate across iEEG contacts in children with MRE. The association between the onset-ripple-zone resection and good outcome indicates that onset-ripples are promising epilepsy biomarkers, which estimate the epileptogenic tissue better than spread-ripples or onset-spikes.

AB  - Object. Occipital resections for epilepsy are rare. Reasons for this are the relative infrequency of occipital epilepsy, difficulty in localizing epilepsy originating in the occipital lobe, imprecisely defined seizure outcome in patients treated with focal occipital resections in the MR imaging era, and concerns about producing visual deficits. The impact of lesion location on vision and seizure biology, the management decision-making process, and the outcomes following resection need elaboration. Methods. The authors studied 21 consecutive patients who underwent focal occipital resections for epilepsy at Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center over a 13-year period during which MR imaging was used. Demographics, imaging, and data relating to the epilepsy and its surgical management were collected. The collateral sulcus, the border between the medial surface and the lateral convexity, and the inferior temporal sulcus were used to subdivide the occipital lobe into medial, lateral, and basal zones. Lesions that did not involve most or all of the occipital lobe (sublobar) were spatially categorized into these zones. Visual function, semiology, and scalp electroencephalography were evaluated in relation to these spatial categories. Preresection and postresection visual function and seizure frequency were evaluated and compared. Lastly, an exhaustive review and discussion of the published literature on occipital resections for epilepsy was carried out. Results. Five lesions were lobar and 16 were sublobar. Patients with medial or lobar lesions had a much greater likelihood of preoperative visual field defects. Those with basal or lateral lesions had a greater likelihood of having a visual aura preceding some or all of their seizures and a trend (not significant) toward having a concordant lateralized onset by scalp electroencephalography. Invasive recordings were used in 8 cases. All patients had lesions (malformations of cortical development, tumors, or gliosis) that were completely resected, as evaluated on postoperative MR imaging. At last follow-up, 17 patients (81%) were seizure free or had only occasional auras (Wieser Class 1 or 2). The remaining 4 patients (19%) had a worthwhile improvement in seizure control (Class 3 or 4). Of the patients for whom both pre- and postoperative visual testing data were available, 50% suffered no new visual deficits, and 17% each developed a new quadrantanopia or a hemianopia. Conclusions. Lesional occipital lobe epilepsy can be successfully managed with resection to obtain excellent seizure-free rates. Individually tailored resections (in lateral occipital lesions, for example) may help preserve intact vision in a subset of cases (38% in this series). Invasive recordings may further guide surgical decision-making as delineated by an algorithm generated by the authors. The authors' results suggest that the spatial location of the lesion correlates both with the semiology of the seizure and with the presence of visual deficit.

AB  - Results: MRI was not contributory in 20% of patients (9.5% in group 1; 25% in group 2). Electrical stimulations localised the motor area in all patients when performed (49% of patients), even in group 1 (62% of patients). SEEG led to surgery in 78% of patients (90.5% in group 1; 73% in group 2), after a second invasive investigation in 9.2 % of patients. The resection involved more than one lobe in 25% of patients (37% in group 1; 19% in group 2). Ultimately, 78% of patients with a low probability of having surgery before SEEG received surgery (88% in group 1). The surgical outcome of Engel class 1 was reported for 67% of patients (79% of patients in group 1 and 59% in group 2). No complications occurred.
Conclusion: SEEG in children is safe and useful, and the surgical outcome in younger children is as good as, or sometimes even better than, that in older children. As a result of lower rates of complication and morbidity, SEEG appears to be more appropriate, in comparison to subdural grids, in situations where it is unclear if patients will have surgery after an invasive investigation.
Aim: We report our experience of stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) in 65 children with drug-resistant seizures, with a particular emphasis on young children.
Methods: We retrospectively studied all SEEG performed between 2009 and 2011 in our centre. As SEEG can have several indications, the patients were classified into three categories, according to the probability of surgery. The contribution of SEEG to the final decision regarding surgery was evaluated for each category separately. We also compared the main demographic and surgical data of children younger than 5 years of age (Group 1; 21 children) with those older than five years of age at the time of investigation (Group 2; 44 patients).

AB  - Objective: Functional MRI was used to determine differences in patterns of cortical activation between children who suffered perinatal left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and healthy children performing a silent verb generation task. Methods: Ten children with prior perinatal left MCA stroke (age 6-16 years) and ten healthy age matched controls completed an executive language activation task. fMRI scans were acquired on a 3 T scanner using T2* weighted gradient echo, echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence. Random effects analysis and independent component analysis (ICA) were used to compute activation maps. Results: Both analysis methods demonstrated alternative activation of cortical areas in children with perinatal stroke. Following perinatal stroke, typical left dominant productive language areas in the inferior frontal gyrus were displaced to anatomical identical areas in the right hemisphere (p = .001). In addition, stroke patients showed more bilateral activation in superior temporal and anterior cingulate gyri and increased activation in primary visual cortex when compared to healthy controls. There was no relation between lesion size and the degree of right hemisphere activation. ICA showed that the healthy controls had a negative correlation with the time course in the right inferior frontal gyrus in the same region that was activated in stroke subjects. Interpretation: This functional MRI study in children revealed novel patterns of cortical language reorganization following perinatal stroke. The addition of ICA is complementary to Random Effects Analysis, allowing for the exploration of potential subtle differences in pathways in functional MRI data obtained from both healthy and pathological groups.

TI  - To move or not to move: Imperatives modulate action-related verb processing in the motor system
AU  - Tomasino, B.

T2  - Neuroscience
AB  - It has been suggested that the processing of action-related words involves activation of the motor circuitry. Using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), the current study further explored the interaction between action and language by investigating whether the linguistic context, in which an action word occurs, modulates motor circuitry activity related to the processing of action words. To this end, we examined whether the presentation of hand action-related verbs as positive or negative imperatives, for example, "Do grasp" or "Don't write," modulates neural activity in the hand area of primary motor cortex (M1) or premotor cortex (Pm). Subjects (n = 19) were asked to read silently the imperative phrases, in which both meaningful action verbs and meaningless pseudo-verbs were presented, and to decide whether they made sense (lexical decision task). At the behavioral level, response times in the lexical decision task were significantly longer for negative, compared to positive, imperatives. At the neural level, activity was differentially decreased by action verbs presented as negative imperatives for the premotor and the primary motor cortex of both hemispheres. The data suggest that context (here: positive vs. negative imperatives), in which an action verb is encountered, modulates the neural activity within key areas of the motor system. The finding implies that motor simulation (or motor planning) rather than semantic processing per se may underlie previously observed motor system activation related to action verb processing. Furthermore, the current data suggest that negative imperatives may inhibit motor simulation or motor planning processes. © 2010 IBRO.

TI  - Electrophysiological studies of face processing in developmental prosopagnosia: Neuropsychological and neurodevelopmental perspectives
AU  - Towler, J.

T2  - Cognitive Neuropsychology
AB  - People with developmental prosopagnosia (DP) show severe face-recognition deficits that typically emerge during childhood without history of neurological damage. We review findings from recent event-related brain potential (ERP) studies of face perception and face recognition in DP. The generic face-sensitivity of the N170 component is present in most DPs, suggesting rapid category-selective streaming of facial information. In contrast, DPs show atypical N170 face inversion effects, indicative of impaired structural encoding, specifically for upright faces. In line with neurodevelopmental accounts of DP, these effects are similar to those observed for other developmental disorders, as well as for younger children and older adults. Identity-sensitive ERP components (N250, P600f) triggered during successful face recognition are similar for DPs and control participants, indicating that the same mechanisms are active in both groups. The presence of covert face-recognition effects for the N250 component suggests that visual face memory and semantic memory can become disconnected in some individuals with DP. The implications of these results for neuropsychological and neurodevelopmental perspectives on DP are discussed. © 2012, Copyright Psychology Press.

AB  - This study examined whether systematic whole-body stimulation and increased attention to visuospatial motion patterns can enhance the appraisal of action meanings evoked by naturalistic texts. Participants listened to action and neutral (non-action) narratives before and after videogame-based bodily training, and responded to questions on information realized by verbs (denoting abstract and action processes) and circumstances (conveying locative or temporal details, for example). Strategically, we worked with dyslexic children, whose potential comprehension deficits could give room to post-training improvements. Results showed a selective boost in understanding of action information, even when controlling for baseline performance. Also, this effect proved uninfluenced by short-term memory skills, and it was absent when training relied on non-action videogames requiring minimal bodily engagement. Of note, the movements described in the texts did not match those performed by participants, suggesting that well-established effector-and direction-specific language embodiment effects may be accompanied by more coarse-grained sensorimotor resonance, driven by activation of motor and visuospatial sensory systems. In sum, the stimulation of movement-related mechanisms seems to selectively boost the appraisal of actions evoked by naturalistic texts. By demonstrating such links between two real-life activities, our study offers an empirical tie between embodied and situated accounts of cognition. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is associated with neurologic morbidity and mortality. We investigated whether cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) is associated with neurologic outcomes and survival in children on ECMO. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of children aged 1 day to 20 years who underwent ECMO with routine cerebral rSO2 monitoring in the pediatric intensive care unit at a single academic center between February 2008 and September 2014. We collected all serial rSO2 values recorded in the electronic medical record during the ECMO course. Favorable outcome was defined as survival with Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) ≤ 2 at hospital discharge or no decline from baseline PCPC. Results: We reviewed data from 153 patients who underwent 156 ECMO runs. The median age was 12.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 2 days—15 months). Ninety-nine (64%) patients survived to hospital discharge, and 82/99 (83%) survivors had favorable neurologic outcome by discharge PCPC. Neuroimaging studies were obtained in 135 (87%) patients, 59 (44%) of which showed abnormal findings. Ninety-two (59%) patients had any rSO2 ≤ 50%, 60 (38%) had any rSO2 decline &gt; 20% from baseline, and 26 (17%) had any rSO2 decline &gt; 20% from the reading 1 h prior. Any rSO2 ≤ 50% and any rSO2 decline &gt; 20% from baseline were each associated with unfavorable outcome at hospital discharge (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.82 [95% CI 1.10–7.25] and 4.52 [95% CI 1.76–11.58], respectively). rSO2 decline &gt; 20% from the reading 1 h prior was not significantly associated with the outcomes. Conclusion: Among children in one institution who underwent routine clinical rSO2 monitoring during ECMO, rSO2 decline was associated with unfavorable short-term neurologic outcome and death after adjusting for potential confounders. The effectiveness of initiating early preventative measures in these high-risk patients needs further study. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and Neurocritical Care Society.

AB  - The complexities of pediatric brain imaging have precluded studies that trace the neural development of cognitive skills acquired during childhood. Using a task that isolates reading-related brain activity and minimizes confounding performance effects, we carried out a cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using subjects whose ages ranged from 6 to 22 years. We found that learning to read is associated with two patterns of change in brain activity: increased activity in left-hemisphere middle temporal and inferior frontal gyri and decreased activity in right inferotemporal cortical areas. Activity in the left-posterior superior temporal sulcus of the youngest readers was associated with the maturation of their phonological processing abilities. These findings inform current reading models and provide strong support for Orton's 1925 theory of reading development.

AB  - Behavioral evidence shows that sleep is crucial for the consolidation of declarative memories in children as in adults. However, the underlying cerebral mechanisms remain virtually unexplored. Using magnetoencephalography, we investigated in children (8.0-12.5 years) the impact of sleep (90-minute nap) on the neurophysiological processes underlying the creation and consolidation of novel associations between unknown objects and their functions. Learning-dependent changes in brain activity were observed within hippocampal and parahippocampal regions, followed by sleep-dependent changes in the prefrontal cortex, whereas no equivalent change was observed after a similar period of wakeful rest. Hence, our results show that in school-age children a 90-minute daytime nap after learning is sufficient to trigger the reorganization of memory-related brain activity toward prefrontal areas, where it incorporates into pre-existing semantic knowledge. This functional reorganization process in children is similar to that observed in adults but occurs at a much faster rate, which may contribute to the development of the impressive learning skills that characterize childhood. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Learning the functional properties of objects is a core mechanism in the development of conceptual, cognitive and linguistic knowledge in children. The cerebral processes underlying these learning mechanisms remain unclear in adults and unexplored in children. Here, we investigated the neurophysiological patterns underpinning the learning of functions for novel objects in 10-year-old healthy children. Event-related fields (ERFs) were recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a picture-definition task. Two MEG sessions were administered, separated by a behavioral verbal learning session during which children learned short definitions about the "magical" function of 50 unknown non-objects. Additionally, 50 familiar real objects and 50 other unknown non-objects for which no functions were taught were presented at both MEG sessions. Children learned at least 75% of the 50 proposed definitions in less than one hour, illustrating children's powerful ability to rapidly map new functional meanings to novel objects. Pre- and post-learning ERFs differences were analyzed first in sensor then in source space. Results in sensor space disclosed a learning-dependent modulation of ERFs for newly learned non-objects, developing 500-800 msec after stimulus onset. Analyses in the source space windowed over this late temporal component of interest disclosed underlying activity in right parietal, bilateral orbito-frontal and right temporal regions. Altogether, our results suggest that learning-related evolution in late ERF components over those regions may support the challenging task of rapidly creating new semantic representations supporting the processing of the meaning and functions of novel objects in children. © 2013 Urbain et al.

AB  - Background: Viewing pictures activates the human brain in a complex manner. Stimulated brain areas can be identified by electrophysiological methods even in children. Subjects and method: Event related potentials (ERP) were recorded with EEG-surface electrodes in children and adolescents who were shown pictures of increasing complexity. Pictures were categorized into morphologic features such as brightness, color and pattern as well as semantic content. Results: Presentation of comics and unstructured pictures, similar in color and brightness, revealed ERP with nearly identical early components (P 100). However, substantial differences were found in frontocentral brain areas. A negative wave at approximately 400 ms was recorded only when comics were shown. Conclusions: Semantic scenes provoked significant different ERP, which indicate an early involvement of complex neuronal networks. These results could be applied in the research of pediatric cognitive disturbances. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

AB  - In children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, centrotemporal spikes may cause language dysfunction via disruption of underlying functional neuroanatomy. Fifteen patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and 15 healthy controls completed 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) language paradigms; standardized cognitive and language assessments were also performed. For all paradigms, children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes showed specific regional differences in activation compared to controls. Children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes also differed from controls on neuropsychological testing. They did not differ in general intelligence, but children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes scored significantly lower than controls on tests of language, visuomotor integration, and processing speed. These results extend previous findings of lower language and cognitive skills in patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and suggest epilepsy-related remodeling of language networks that may underlie these observed differences. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - Global anterograde amnesia is described in three patients with brain injuries that occurred in one case at birth, in another by age 4, and in the third at age 9. Magnetic resonance techniques revealed bilateral hippocampal pathology in all three cases. Remarkably, despite their pronounced amnesia for the episodes of everyday life, all three patients attended mainstream schools and attained levels of speech and language competence, literacy, and factual knowledge that are within the low average to average range. The findings provide support for the view that the episodic and semantic components of cognitive memory are partly dissociable, with only the episodic component being fully dependent on the hippocampus.

TI  - Developmental specialization of the left parietal cortex for the semantic representation of Arabic numerals: An fMR-adaptation study

T2  - Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - The way the human brain constructs representations of numerical symbols is poorly understood. While increasing evidence from neuroimaging studies has indicated that the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) becomes increasingly specialized for symbolic numerical magnitude representation over developmental time, the extent to which these changes are associated with age-related differences in symbolic numerical magnitude representation or with developmental changes in non-numerical processes, such as response selection, remains to be uncovered. To address these outstanding questions we investigated developmental changes in the cortical representation of symbolic numerical magnitude in 6- to 14-year-old children using a passive functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation design, thereby mitigating the influence of response selection. A single-digit Arabic numeral was repeatedly presented on a computer screen and interspersed with the presentation of novel digits deviating as a function of numerical ratio (smaller/larger number). Results demonstrated a correlation between age and numerical ratio in the left IPS, suggesting an age-related increase in the extent to which numerical symbols are represented in the left IPS. Brain activation of the right IPS was modulated by numerical ratio but did not correlate with age, indicating hemispheric differences in IPS engagement during the development of symbolic numerical representation. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used extensively for functional neuroimaging over the past decade, in part because it is considered a powerful tool for investigating brain function in human infants and young children, for whom other neuroimaging techniques are not suitable. In particular, several studies have measured hemodynamic responses in the occipital region in infants upon exposure to visual stimuli. In the present study, we used a multi-channel NIRS to measure neuronal activity in a macaque monkey who was trained to watch videos showing various circus animals performing acrobatic activities without fixing the head position of the monkey. Cortical activity from the occipital region was measured first by placing a probe comprising a 3 × 5 array of emitters and detectors (2 × 4 cm) on the area (area 17), and the robustness and stability of the results were confirmed across sessions. Cortical responses were then measured from the dorsofrontal region. The oxygenated hemoglobin signals increased in area 9 and decreased in area 8b in response to viewing the videos. The results suggest that these regions are involved in cognitive processing of visually presented stimuli. The monkey showed positive responsiveness to the stimuli from the affective standpoint, but its attentional response to them was an inhibitory one. © 2010 Wakita, Shibasaki, Ishizuka, Schnackenberg, Fujiawara and Masataka.

AB  - Recent evidence demonstrates that a region of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) is selective to visually observed social interactions in adults. In contrast, little is known about neural responses to social interactions in children. Here, we used fMRI to ask whether the pSTS is ‘tuned’ to social interactions in children at all, and if so, how selectivity might differ from adults. This was investigated in the pSTS, along with several other socially-tuned regions in neighbouring temporal cortex: extrastriate body area, face selective STS, fusiform face area, and mentalizing selective temporo-parietal junction. Both children and adults showed selectivity to social interaction within right pSTS, while only adults showed selectivity on the left. Adults also showed both more focal and greater selectivity than children (6–12 years) bilaterally. Exploratory sub-group analyses showed that younger children (6–8), but not older children (9–12), are less selective than adults on the right, while there was a continuous developmental trend (adults > older > younger) in left pSTS. These results suggest that, over development, the neural response to social interactions is characterized by increasingly more selective, focal, and bilateral pSTS responses, a process that likely continues into adolescence. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The progress that has been made in the treatment of the patient with medulloblastoma is gratifying. Survival for those who fall into the lower risk category probably exceeds 75%. For this degree of success, however, patients and their families have had to pay a price in terms of suffering the deleterious late effects of treatment. With sophisticated neuroimaging techniques diagnoses are now being made in a timely fashion and surgical mortality has been reduced to almost zero in most major medical centers. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy regimens have been increasingly successful, and further refinements of treatment are to be expected with the completion of randomized cooperative group trials. It is time to focus on means of achieving similar, or even better results, with reduced doses of neuraxis radiation, whenever possible, especially in the younger patient.

AB  - Background. Hemorrhage is a major category of the clinical symptoms of moyamoya disease (MMD). Intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhages are the most common hemorrhages in MMD, and subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAHs) are notably rare. There have only been a few previous case reports of this imaging manifestation. In the present study, we investigated the clinical and neuroimaging features of MMD patients who presented with SAH and sought to identify the possible causes of hemorrhage. Methods. The right and left cerebral hemispheres of each patient were identified as hemorrhagic or non-hemorrhagic. Each hemisphere was assessed for Suzuki stage, and dilatation and branch extension of the anterior choroidal artery (AChA) and posterior communicating artery (P-CoM) and for the degree of transdural anastomosis and posterior circulation compensation. Next, these data were statistically analyzed for correlations with the SAH events. Results. In 34 of 349 hemorrhagic MMD patients, the first episode of hemorrhage was a SAH, among which, 26 (76.5%) patients were women and there was only one pediatric patient. The Suzuki stage was not statistically correlated with the SAH events. There were also no correlations between SAH and dilatation or abnormal branching of the AChA and P-CoM. In contrast, SAH and transdural anastomosis were correlated. 25 of the 34 hemorrhagic hemispheres (73.5%) were positive for transdural anastomosis, and this number was 15 (44.1%) in the non-hemorrhagic hemispheres; this difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusions. SAH is an important type of hemorrhage in MMD patients and ranks as the fourth most common type after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and ICH + IVH. It mainly occurs in adult women, and the rupture of the transdural anastomosis might be the main cause of this condition. © 2015 The Neurosurgical Foundation.

AB  - Poor readers perform worse than their normal reading peers on a variety of speech perception tasks, which may be linked to their phonological processing abilities. The purpose of the study was to compare the brain activation patterns of normal and impaired readers on speech perception to better understand the phonological basis in reading disability. Whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded as good and poor readers, 7-13 years of age, performed an auditory word discrimination task. We used an auditory oddball paradigm in which the 'deviant' stimuli (/bat/, /kat/, /rat/) differed in the degree of phonological contrast (one versus three features) from a repeated standard word (/pat/). Both good and poor readers responded more slowly to deviants that were phonologically similar compared to deviants that were phonologically dissimilar to the standard word. Source analysis of the MEG data using minimum norm estimation (MNE) showed that compared to good readers, poor readers had reduced left-hemisphere activation to the most demanding phonological condition reflecting their difficulties with phonological processing. Furthermore, unlike good readers, poor readers did not show differences in activation as a function of the degree of phonological contrast. These results are consistent with a phonological account of reading disability. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) reveal dysfunction in the neural systems mediating object processing (particularly faces) and social cognition, but few investigations have systematically assessed the specificity of the dysfunction. We compared cortical responses in typically developing adolescents and those with ASD to stimuli from distinct conceptual domains known to elicit category-related activity in separate neural systems. In Experiment 1, subjects made category decisions to photographs, videos, and point-light displays of people and tools. In Experiment 2, subjects interpreted displays of simple, geometric shapes in motion depicting social or mechanical interactions. In both experiments, we found a selective deficit in the ASD subjects for dynamic social stimuli (videos and point-light displays of people, moving geometric shapes), but not static images, in the functionally localized lateral region of the right fusiform gyrus, including the fusiform face area. In contrast, no group differences were found in response to either static images or dynamic stimuli in other brain regions associated with face and social processing (e.g. posterior superior temporal sulcus, amygdala), suggesting disordered connectivity between these regions and the fusiform gyrus in ASD. This possibility was confirmed by functional connectivity analysis. © The Author 2012.

Thirty-five typically developing children aged from 5 to 6 years performed auditory phonological (same sound judgment) and semantic (related meaning judgment) word-level tasks. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined specialization within the language network, by conducting three levels of analysis. First, we directly compared activation between tasks and found a greater sound judgment as compared to meaning judgment activation in left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and supramarginal gyrus. In contrast, greater meaning judgment as compared to sound judgment task activation was found in left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Second, we examined the brain-behavior correlations and found that phonological skill was correlated with the task difference in activation in left superior temporal sulcus, whereas semantic skill was correlated with the task difference in activation in left MTG. Third, we compared between two experimental conditions within each task and found a parametric effect in left STG for the sound judgment task, and a parametric effect in left MTG for the meaning judgment task. The results of this study indicate that, by the age of 5–6 years, typically developing children already show some specialization of temporo-parietal brain regions for phonological and semantic processes. However, there were no task differences in the left inferior frontal gyrus suggesting that the frontal cortex may not yet be specialized in this age range, which is consistent with the delayed maturation of the frontal cortex. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The comparison of words and pseudowords has been extensively used in adult neuroimaging studies to inform neurocognitive models of reading but has rarely been used to inform models of reading acquisition. Using a rhyming judgment task, the current study examined age-related differences in the spelling to sound mapping mechanisms involved in word and pseudoword reading. We hypothesized a developmental increase in specialization of the brain mechanisms engaged for word and pseudoword processing. Consistent with adult studies, children in the current study demonstrated a greater activation for words as compared to pseudowords in the anterior left ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOT). Inconsistent with adult studies, children also showed greater activation for words as compared to pseudowords in the mid-posterior left vOT, indicating a robust semantic influence on orthographic processing in young readers. Furthermore, our results did not indicate a lexicality by age interaction for 8- to 13-year-old children, suggesting that the adult-like specialization in the left vOT only appears later in development. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Understanding how language networks change during childhood is important for theories of cognitive development and for identifying the neural causes of language impairment. Despite this, there is currently little systematic evidence regarding the typical developmental trajectory for language from the field of neuroimaging. We reviewed functional MRI (fMRI) studies published between 1992 and 2014, and quantified the evidence for age-related changes in localisation and lateralisation of fMRI activation in the language network (excluding the cerebellum and subcortical regions). Although age-related changes differed according to task type and input modality, we identified four consistent findings concerning the typical maturation of the language system. First, activation in core semantic processing regions increases with age. Second, activation in lower-level sensory and motor regions increases with age as activation in higher-level control regions reduces. We suggest that this reflects increased automaticity of language processing as children become more proficient. Third, the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (regions associated with the default mode network) show increasing attenuation across childhood and adolescence. Finally, language lateralisation is established by approximately 5. years of age. Small increases in leftward lateralisation are observed in frontal regions, but these are tightly linked to performance. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Several small patient studies and case reports raise concerns that the reliability of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be impaired in the vicinity of cerebral lesions. This could affect the clinical validity of fMRI for presurgical language lateralization. The current study sets out to identify if a systematic effect of lesion type and localization on fMRI exists. Methods: We classify lesions typically occurring in epilepsy patients according to (1) their potential to disturb blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-effect generation or detection or to disturb spatial brain normalization, and (2) the proximity of lesions to protocol-specific volumes of interest (VOIs). The effect of lesions is evaluated through the examination of 238 epilepsy patients and a subgroup of 37 patients with suspected unilateral left-language dominance according to the Wada test. Results: Patients with fMRI-critical lesions such as cavernomas, gliomas, and mass defects close to VOIs, or with severe atrophy, show lower lateralization indices (LIs) and more often discordant language lateralization with the Wada test than do patients without such lesions. Discussion: This study points seriously toward fMRI-language lateralization being sensitive to cerebral lesions. Some lesion types and locations are more critical than others. Our results question the noncritical application of fMRI in patients with cerebral lesions. © 2009 International League Against Epilepsy.

AB  - Background Stroke is a common complication of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and pediatric cardiac surgical patients may be at higher risk. Epidemiology and risk factors for stroke in these patients are not well characterized. Methods We analyzed pediatric (<18 years) cardiac ECMO cases in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry from 2002 to 2013. Cardiac surgical patients were identified, and procedures were stratified according to The Society of Thoracic Surgeons morbidity categories. The primary outcome was any stroke (hemorrhagic or infarction) identified by neuroimaging. Risk factors were identified through multivariable logistic regression. Results We analyzed 3,517 cardiac surgical patients; 81% with cyanotic disease, and 57% in high-risk categories from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (categories 4 and 5). Overall, 12% experienced stroke while receiving ECMO, and those with stroke had greater in-hospital mortality (72% versus 51%; p < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, neonatal status (adjusted odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.4), lower weight-for-age z score (adjusted odds ratio, 1.1 for each 1-point decrease; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.25), and longer ECMO duration (upper quartile [≥167 hours] adjusted odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.8) were independently associated with increased stroke risk, whereas cyanotic disease, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons category, and bypass time were not. Conclusions This multicenter analysis demonstrates that pediatric cardiac surgical patients on ECMO are at high risk of stroke; younger or underweight patients and those with longer ECMO duration are at greatest risk, independent of procedural complexity. Future study is necessary to determine how anticoagulation or other clinical practices can be modified to reduce stroke incidence. © 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

AB  - Analogical reasoning, or the ability to find correspondences between entities based on shared relationships, supports knowledge acquisition. As such, the development of this ability during childhood is thought to promote learning. Here, we sought to better understand the mechanisms by which analogical reasoning about semantic relations improves over childhood and adolescence (e.g. chalk is to chalkboard as pen is to…?). We hypothesized that age-related differences would manifest as differences in the brain regions associated with one or more of the following cognitive functions: (1) controlled semantic retrieval, or the ability to retrieve task-relevant semantic associations; (2) response control, or the ability to override the tendency to respond to a salient distractor; and/or (3) relational integration, or the ability to consider jointly two mental relations. In order to test these hypotheses, we analyzed patterns of fMRI activation during performance of a pictorial propositional analogy task across 95 typically developing children between the ages of 6 and 18 years old. Despite large age-related differences in task performance, particularly over ages 6–10 but through to around age 14, participants across the whole age range recruited a common network of frontal, parietal and temporal regions. However, activation in a brain region that has been implicated in controlled semantic retrieval – left anterior prefrontal cortex (BA 47/45) – was positively correlated with age, and also with performance after controlling for age. This finding indicates that improved performance over middle childhood and early adolescence on this analogical reasoning task is driven largely by improvements in the ability to selectively retrieve task-relevant semantic relationships. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Instead of assessing activation in distinct brain regions, approaches to investigating the networks underlying distinct brain functions have come into the focus of neuroscience research. Here, we provide a completely data-driven framework for assessing functional and causal connectivity in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, employing Granger's causality. We investigate the networks underlying story processing in 17 healthy children (8f, 9m, 10.4 ± 2.8 years, 6.5-15.4 years). Extensive functional connectivity exists between brain regions, including some not detected in standard random effects analyses. Causal connectivity analyses demonstrate a clear dominance of left-sided language regions for both forward and backward interactions with other network nodes. We believe our approach to be useful in helping to assess language networks in the normal or pathological setting; it may also aid in providing better starting estimates for the more hypothesis-driven approaches like structural equation or dynamic causal modeling. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hemispheric dominance for language is an important issue in functional neuroimaging, particularly driven by efforts to overcome the need for the invasive Wada test, which is all the more pressing in children. Here, we aimed at developing new paradigms for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for assessment of language dominance that can be used in younger children and allow for performance monitoring. Two new tasks (letter and animal task) were developed and compared to two reference tasks (synonyms and verb generation task) from the literature. Overall, 23 healthy children participated (13 boys, 10 girls, 10.2 T 2.5 years, range 6.1-15.3 years). Analysis was done using statistical nonparametrical mapping (SnPM2) on SPM2. Both reference tasks show activation in a number of left-frontal brain regions. The letter task induced a very localized activation in the left hemisphere's Broca's region, while not activating other frontal brain regions. Lateralization (as assessed in different anatomically and functionally defined regions) was consistent and strong. The animal task failed to activate frontal brain regions and was not suitable for assessing language dominance in children in this form. We conclude that while both reference tasks are useful for determining language dominance, they coactivate a number of taskrelated frontal areas not directly involved in language processing. Additionally, one task is not applicable in young children while the other does not allow performance monitoring. The letter task allows to selectively activate language areas in the dominant hemisphere and is applicable even in the very lowest age group amenable to fMRI investigations while still allowing performance monitoring. It may thus be a useful tool in assessing normal and pathological language organization. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Proposed caudal appendage classification system; spinal cord tethering associated with sacrococcygeal eversion
AU  - Wilkinson, C.C.
AU  - Boylan, A.J.
T2  - Child's Nervous System
AB  - Introduction: The most commonly used classification system for caudal appendages (aka human tails) dates from the 1980s and classifies appendages (tails) as either true tails or pseudotails. Advances in neuroimaging since the 1980s, however, as well as an ever-increasing number of reported cases, have made this system outdated. Sacrococcygeal eversion is a condition in which the distal sacral and coccygeal vertebrae are curved in a retroverted rather than anteverted direction. It can give rise to one type of caudal appendage. Sacrococcygeal eversion has never been associated with spinal cord tethering in any previously published reports. Methods: We reviewed all cases of caudal appendage encountered by pediatric neurosurgeons at Children’s Hospital Colorado since 2000 in which the appendage would be classified as a true tail by the most commonly used system mentioned above. We also reviewed cases of sacrococcygeal eversion encountered since 2000 by the same group of pediatric neurosurgeons. We searched the hospital electronic medical record system for additional appendages using the terms “caudal appendage” and “persistent human tail.” Results: We found 9 “true” tails (as classified by the most commonly used system). All 9 were associated with tethering or possible tethering of the spinal cord and 6 were associated with a low-lying conus medullaris. There were 8 cases of sacrococcygeal eversion, including 2 associated with Apert or Pfeiffer syndrome and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) mutations; these have previously been reported. There was a single case of sacrococcygeal eversion associated with Goldenhar or Turner syndrome; the former was associated with a potentially tethering lesion. Four cases of sacrococcygeal eversion not associated with any known syndrome were also found; two of these were associated with tethering or potentially tethering lesions. Conclusions: Most so-called true tails are likely cutaneous markers for spinal dysraphism and spinal cord tethering and are not remnants of the embryonic human tail. Sacrococcygeal eversion can be associated with spinal cord tethering. Based on our cases, and on review of the literature, we devised a five-category classification system for caudal appendages: (1) soft-tissue caudal appendages, (2) bony caudal appendages, (3) bony caudal prominences, (4) true tails, and (5) “other” caudal appendages. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Asymmetric Meckel cave enlargement: A potential marker of PHACES syndrome
AU  - Wright, J.N.
AU  - Wycoco, V.
T2  - American Journal of Neuroradiology
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: PHACES syndrome is a complex of morphologic abnormalities of unknown cause and includes posterior fossa abnormalities; head and neck infantile hemangiomas; arterial, cardiac, and eye anomalies; and sternal or abdominal wall defects. Accurate identification of the syndrome is important for optimal treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of asymmetric Meckel cave enlargement, a potential novel imaging marker, in a population of patients referred for evaluation of possible PHACES syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients referred for neuroimaging evaluation of possible PHACES syndrome were identified and stratified on the basis of their ultimate clinical PHACES diagnosis categorization into PHACES, possible PHACES, or not PHACES. MR imaging studies were subsequently reviewed for the presence or absence of unilateral Meckel cave enlargement, with the reviewer blinded to the ultimate PHACES syndrome categorization. RESULTS: Twenty-five of 85 patients (29%) were ultimately categorized as having PHACES or possible PHACES according to consensus guidelines. Asymmetric Meckel cave enlargement was present in 76% (19/25) of these patients and in 82% (19/23) of only those patients with definite PHACES. This finding was present in none of the 60 patients determined not to have PHACES syndrome. In 7/19 patients (37%) with this finding, subtle MR imaging abnormalities consistent with PHACES were missed on the initial MR imaging interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: Asymmetric Meckel cave enlargement was a common feature of patients with PHACES in our cohort and may serve as a novel imaging marker. Increased awareness of this imaging feature has the potential to increase the diagnostic accuracy of PHACES. © 2017, American Society of Neuroradiology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sentence comprehension requires the integration of both syntactic and semantic information, the acquisition of which seems to have different trajectories in the developing brain. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the neural correlates underlying syntactic and semantic processing during auditory sentence comprehension as well as its development in preschool children by manipulating case marking and animacy hierarchy cues, respectively. A functional segregation was observed within Broca's area in the left inferior frontal gyrus for adults, where the pars opercularis was involved in syntactic processing and the pars triangularis in semantic processing. By contrast, five-year-old children sensitive to animacy hierarchy cues showed diffuse activation for semantic processing in the left inferior frontal and posterior temporal cortices. While no main effect of case marking was found in the left fronto-temporal language network, children with better syntactic skills showed greater neural responses for syntactically complex sentences, most prominently in the posterior superior temporal cortex. The current study provides both behavioral and neural evidence that five-year-old children compared to adults rely more on semantic information than on syntactic cues during sentence comprehension, but with the development of syntactic abilities, their brain activation in the left fronto-temporal network increases for syntactic processing. © 2015 The Authors.

TI  - A meta-analysis of fMRI studies on Chinese orthographic, phonological, and semantic processing
AU  - Wu, C.-Y.
AU  - Ho, M.H.R.

T2  - NeuroImage
AB  - A growing body of neuroimaging evidence has shown that Chinese character processing recruits differential activation from alphabetic languages due to its unique linguistic features. As more investigations on Chinese character processing have recently become available, we applied a meta-analytic approach to summarize previous findings and examined the neural networks for orthographic, phonological, and semantic processing of Chinese characters independently. The activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method was used to analyze eight studies in the orthographic task category, eleven in the phonological and fifteen in the semantic task categories. Converging activation among three language-processing components was found in the left middle frontal gyrus, the left superior parietal lobule and the left mid-fusiform gyrus, suggesting a common sub-network underlying the character recognition process regardless of the task nature. With increasing task demands, the left inferior parietal lobule and the right superior temporal gyrus were specialized for phonological processing, while the left middle temporal gyrus was involved in semantic processing. Functional dissociation was identified in the left inferior frontal gyrus, with the posterior dorsal part for phonological processing and the anterior ventral part for semantic processing. Moreover, bilateral involvement of the ventral occipito-temporal regions was found for both phonological and semantic processing. The results provide better understanding of the neural networks underlying Chinese orthographic, phonological, and semantic processing, and consolidate the findings of additional recruitment of the left middle frontal gyrus and the right fusiform gyrus for Chinese character processing as compared with the universal language network that has been based on alphabetic languages. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The development of language comprehension abilities in childhood is closely related to the maturation of the brain, especially the ability to process syntactically complex sentences. Recent studies proposed that the fronto-temporal connection within left perisylvian regions, supporting the processing of syntactically complex sentences, is still immature at preschool age. In the current study, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from typically developing 5-year-old children and adults to shed further light on the brain functional development. Children additionally performed a behavioral syntactic comprehension test outside the scanner. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations was analyzed in order to identify the functional correlation networks of language-relevant brain regions. Results showed an intrahemispheric correlation between left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in adults, whereas an interhemispheric correlation between left IFG and its right-hemispheric homolog was predominant in children. Correlation analysis between resting-state functional connectivity and sentence processing performance in 5-year-olds revealed that local connectivity within the left IFG is associated with competence of processing syntactically simple canonical sentences, while long-range connectivity between IFG and pSTS in left hemisphere is associated with competence of processing syntactically relatively more complex non-canonical sentences. The present developmental data suggest that a selective left fronto-temporal connectivity network for processing complex syntax is already in functional connection at the age of 5 years when measured in a non-task situation. The correlational findings provide new insight into the relationship between intrinsic functional connectivity and syntactic language abilities in preschool children. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Brain activity was measured with fMRI in twelve 10- to 12-year-old Chinese children who began learning English when they were 8 years old in order to find out whether there is a common or a distinct neural semantic system for native language (L1) and second language (L2) in low proficiency bilingual subjects. Although they performed less well in L2 in the semantic decision task administered during fMRI measurement, these subjects showed similar robust activation, for both languages, in brain areas involved in semantic processing (e.g. the left inferior frontal cortex). Within-subject and group analyses revealed no significant difference in the activation patterns for L1 and L2 in these regions. These results suggest that at least at single-word level, there are shared neural substrates for semantic processing of L1 and L2 even when one is at a very low L2 proficiency level. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Background: Early prediction of neurologic prognosis in children resuscitated from cardiac arrest is a major challenge. This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of a combined model based on brain computed tomography (CT) and initial blood gas analysis to predict neurologic prognoses in pediatric patients after cardiac arrest. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest from 2000 to 2018. Patients aged one month to 18 years were included. Gray to white matter ratio (GWR), ambient cistern effacement (ACE), and blood gas analysis were studied. The primary outcome was neurological prognosis, which was evaluated using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) scale at discharge. Results: Of 97 resuscitated patients, 64 brain CT images were available. Fourteen patients had a good neurologic outcome (PCPC 1–3) and 50 patients a poor neurologic outcome (PCPC 4–6). The multimodal model (AUC 0.897) containing GWR of basal ganglia (BG), ACE, and blood pH was found to be superior for predicting poor neurologic prognosis than single variable models (AUC of GWR-BG: 0.744, ACE: 0.804, pH: 0.747). Interestingly, we found the GWR-BG cutoff value for specificity 100% differed significantly between patients <4 years (cutoff value: 1.08, p = 0.04) and ≥4 years (cutoff value: 1.18, p = 0.004). Conclusions: The combination of GWR-BG, ambient cistern effacement, and blood pH was found to usefully predict neurological outcome in children resuscitated from cardiac arrest. In addition, the cutoff value of GWR-BG for the prediction of neurologic outcome was found to increase with age. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Frontal lobe dysfunction underlies the differential word retrieval impairment in adolescents with high-functioning autism

AB  - There is substantial evidence of word retrieval impairment as indicated by poor performance on the category fluency test in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this impairment. Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that the lateral frontal cortex plays a key role in flexible word retrieval. Thus, we examined whether individuals with ASD exhibited altered frontal processing during the category fluency test using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-two adolescents with high-functioning ASD (20 males) and 22 typically developing (TD) adolescents (16 males) aged 11–18 years were recruited. All underwent a category fluency paradigm, which required production of animal or means of transportation words for 1 min each although their frontal hemodynamic changes were recorded with fNIRS. We found that adolescents with ASD produced fewer animal but not transportation words (group-by-category interaction: P = 0.003), suggesting differential word retrieval impairment. In addition, unlike TD adolescents who exhibited activation primarily in lateral frontal regions during word production, adolescents with ASD had comparable activation across lateral and medial frontal regions. More importantly, this lack of lateral–medial distinction of activation, which was associated with poor word retrieval, differed significantly between groups only in the animal category (group-by-category interaction: P = 0.018). Thus, our findings implicate frontal lobe dysfunction in the impairment of differential word retrieval in adolescents with ASD. The relatively greater involvement of the medial frontopolar cortex might reflect the use of nonspecialized brain regions to compensate for the category-dependent difficulties with word retrieval in ASD.

Lay Summary: Using an optical imaging tool, we found that adolescents with autism had difficulties with producing semantically related words and exhibited frontal lobe dysfunction. Nonetheless, poor word production and altered brain processing was only seen when these adolescents were asked to produce words from a category of living things but not nonliving things (i.e., animals but not means of transportation). Category-dependent word retrieval problems and frontal lobe dysfunction might be two features of this disorder. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: The authors evaluated the usefulness of scalp-recorded ictal electroencephalograms (EEG) in diagnosing the epileptogenic area in epilepsy with complex partial seizures. Methods: The authors analyzed the ictal EEG of 395 seizures in 43 patients with complex partial seizures. Based on EEG findings the patients were classified according to the degree of localization of their onset areas. The results were then compared with neuroimaging findings. Results: Only 10 patients fell into the category 'discrete', meaning that all the onset areas (as measured by ictal EEG) were localized in the same lobe of the same hemisphere. Seven patients were categorized as 'lateralized', meaning that all the onset areas were clearly lateralized in the same hemisphere but without consistent localization. Eleven patients were classified as 'localized', meaning that the onset area were localized simultaneously in bilateral same lobes, or changed consistently from one lobe in one hemisphere to the same lobe in the opposite hemisphere. The onset area could not be defined in 15 patients and these were categorized as 'not defined'. No patient who underwent seven or more ictal recordings was categorized as discrete. However, when confined only to those patients in whom over 75% of the ictal recordings showed the same onset area, there was a high correlation between the epileptogenic lesions detected by ictal EEG and those detected by neuroimaging techniques. Conclusions: The findings of the present study indicate that ictal EEG recordings are useful for determining the epileptogenic area in epilepsy with complex partial seizures, provided that more than 75% of the ictal recordings show the same ictal onset area.

AB  - Memory functioning undergoes dynamic changes between childhood and adulthood. Spontaneous use of elaborative strategies, which can enhance the recall of information, expands with age and contributes to age-associated improvement in memory functioning. Findings from lesion and neuroimaging studies suggest that the ability to use elaborative strategies is dependent upon intact functioning of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly the dorsolateral PFC region. Because the PFC undergoes protracted maturation, we examined whether age difference in the structure of the PFC is correlated with age-associated increase in strategy use. Here, we investigated the relationship between PFC volume and spontaneous strategy use in a sample of 120 participants aged 5–25 years. We assessed semantic clustering during recall with a standardized word-list recall task (California Verbal Learning Task children's version, CVLT-C) and computed PFC regional volumes from participants’ structural brain images. We observed an age-associated increase in the use of semantic clustering and an age-associated decrease in volumes of the PFC. Further, we found that smaller PFC volume was linked to increased use of semantic clustering. Importantly, the volume of the right dorsolateral PFC partially explained the relation between age and the use of semantic clustering. These findings suggest that PFC maturation supports the development of strategy use and lends further support for the notion that brain-behavior relations change across development. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Dishabituation of the BOLD response to speech sounds
AU  - Zevin, J.D.

T2  - Behavioral and Brain Functions
AB  - Background: Neural systems show habituation responses at multiple levels, including relatively abstract language categories. Dishabituation - responses to non-habituated stimuli - can provide a window into the structure of these categories, without requiring an overt task. Methods: We used an event-related fMR1 design with short interval habituation trials, in which trains of stimuli were presented passively during 1.5 second intervals of relative silence between clustered scans. Trains of four identical stimuli (standard trials) and trains of three identical stimuli followed by a stimulus from a different phonetic category (deviant trials) were presented. This paradigm allowed us to measure and compare the time course of overall responses to speech, and responses to phonetic change. Results: Comparisons between responses to speech and silence revealed strong responses throughout the extent of superior temporal gyrus (STG) bilaterally. Comparisons between deviant and standard trials revealed dishabituation responses in a restricted region of left posterior STG, near the border with supramarginal gyrus (SMG). Novelty responses to deviant trials were also observed in right frontal regions and hippocampus. Conclusion: A passive, dishabituation paradigm provides results similar to studies requiring overt responses. This paradigm can readily be extended for the study of pre-attentive processing of speech in populations such as children and second-language learners whose overt behavior is often difficult to interpret because of ancillary task demands. © 2005 Zevin and McCandliss; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The neural systems for phonological processing of written language have been well identified now, while models based on these neural systems are different for different language systems or age groups. Although each of such models is mostly concordant across different experiments, the results are sensitive to the experiment design and intersubject variability. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis can quantitatively synthesize the data from multiple studies and minimize the interstudy or intersubject differences. In this study, we performed two ALE meta-analysis experiments: one was to examine the neural activation patterns of the phonological processing of two different types of written languages and the other was to examine the development characteristics of such neural activation patterns based on both alphabetic language and logographic language data. The results of our first meta-analysis experiment were consistent with the meta-analysis which was based on the studies published before 2005. And there were new findings in our second meta-analysis experiment, where both adults and children groups showed great activation in the left frontal lobe, the left superior/middle temporal gyrus, and the bilateral middle/superior occipital gyrus. However, the activation of the left middle/inferior frontal gyrus was found increase with the development, and the activation was found decrease in the following areas: the right claustrum and inferior frontal gyrus, the left inferior/medial frontal gyrus, the left middle/superior temporal gyrus, the right cerebellum, and the bilateral fusiform gyrus. It seems that adults involve more phonological areas, whereas children involve more orthographic areas and semantic areas. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating multiple sparse, co-activated brain regions from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) observations belonging to different classes. More precisely, we propose a method to analyze similarities and differences in functional connectivity between children and young adults. Often, analysis is conducted on each class separately, and differences across classes are identified with an additional postprocessing step using adequate statistical tools. Here, we propose to rely on a generalized fused Lasso penalty, which allows us to make use of the entire data set in order to estimate connectivity patterns that are either shared across classes, or specific to a given group. By using the entire population during the estimation, we hope to increase the power of our analysis. The proposed model falls in the category of population-wise matrix decomposition, and a simple and efficient alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is introduced to solve the associated optimization problem. After validating our approach on simulated data, experiments are performed on resting-state fMRI imaging from the Philadelphia neurodevelopmental cohort data set, comprised of normally developing children from ages 8 to 21. Developmental differences were observed in various brain regions, as a total of three class-specific resting-state components were identified. Statistical analysis of the estimated subject-specific features, as well as classification results (based on age groups, up to 81% accuracy, n = 583 samples) related to these components demonstrate that the proposed method is able to properly extract meaningful shared and class-specific sub-networks. © 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Forming intentions successfully: Differential compensational mechanisms of adolescents and old adults

T2  - Cortex
AB  - Introduction: Forming an intention is a key aspect of prospective memory, i.e., the ability to encode, retain, and later realize an intention with a delay of minutes, hours or days. Behavioural and neurophysiological findings from both prospective and retrospective memory research suggest that the efficiency of encoding processes is reduced at both ends of the lifespan and that neural generators underlying successful encoding might differ in childhood and old age. Hence, the present study investigates compensational neural mechanisms during the encoding of intentions in adolescents and old adults compared to young adults. Methods: We compared Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) and their source localization in 14 adolescents (11-13 years), 14 young adults (18-25 years), and 14 old adults (64-79 years) in a prospective memory task that was embedded in a semantic categorization task. Results: Our data revealed three event-related modulations that differentiate between conditions (i.e., ongoing activity and successful intention formation trials) and groups. Source localizations of these modulations with standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) revealed compensational activations in adolescents and old adults compared to young adults in successful intention formation trials: while adolescents showed a higher activation of secondary occipital regions in the time window of 500-1200. msec with a maximum around 800. msec, old adults activated prefrontal regions to a greater extent beginning at 700. msec, persisting until 1200. msec and expanding to middle temporal regions. Conclusion: For a successful encoding of intentions adolescents and old adults recruit more neural generators than young adults. More importantly, the pattern of these compensational activations is different when comparing adolescents with young adults and old adults with young adults. These differences are discussed with regard to differential maturational changes in the brain. © 2009 Elsevier Srl.

AB  - Overview: Behavioural data reveal an inverted U-shaped function in the efficiency of prospective memory from childhood to young adulthood to later adulthood. However, prior research has not directly compared processes contributing to age-related variation in prospective memory across the lifespan, hence it is unclear whether the same factors explain the 'rise and fall' of prospective remembering from childhood to later adulthood. The present study examined this question using a paradigm that allowed us to consider the behavioural and neural correlates of processes associated with the prospective and retrospective components of prospective memory. Methods: We compared 14 adolescents, 14 young adults, and 14 old adults in a paradigm where the prospective memory task was embedded in a semantic categorization task. Results: The behavioural data revealed an inverted U-shaped function with adolescents and old adults performing poorly relative to young adults. Analyses of the error data revealed that different processes may have contributed to failures of prospective memory in adolescents and older adults. This finding was supported by age differences in ERP-components for cue detection and post-retrieval processes. Additionally, source localization using LORETA revealed different patterns of neural recruitment for adolescents and older adults relative to younger adults. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that adolescents and older adults show different patterns of behavioural errors and neural recruitment for successful prospective remembering indicating that different processes may contribute to the 'rise and fall' of prospective memory across the lifespan. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The prevalence, age of onset, and symptomatology of many neuropsychiatric conditions differ between males and females. To understand the causes and consequences of sex differences it is important to establish where they occur in the human brain. We report the first meta-analysis of typical sex differences on global brain volume, a descriptive account of the breakdown of studies of each compartmental volume by six age categories, and whole-brain voxel-wise meta-analyses on brain volume and density. Gaussian-process regression coordinate-based meta-analysis was used to examine sex differences in voxel-based regional volume and density. On average, males have larger total brain volumes than females. Examination of the breakdown of studies providing total volumes by age categories indicated a bias towards the 18–59 year-old category. Regional sex differences in volume and tissue density include the amygdala, hippocampus and insula, areas known to be implicated in sex-biased neuropsychiatric conditions. Together, these results suggest candidate regions for investigating the asymmetric effect that sex has on the developing brain, and for understanding sex-biased neurological and psychiatric conditions.

T2  - Developmental Science
AB  - The development of language indicating the emergence of thinking about the thoughts of self and others has been scarcely studied in Spanish-speaking children. For this reason, we studied the development of mental state language and various indicators of language development in 25 Spanish-speaking children assessed at 3, 3 1/2, 4, 4 1/2, and 5 years of age. We coded and categorized the 40,250 utterances children produced during the five time points, 1202 (3.01%) of which had mental terms. In this sample, mental state language in Spanish children developed with a similar timeline and patterns as described in English-speaking children. However, several findings were novel for studies of mental state language. The general indexes of syntactic development did not correlate with the production of mental terms. The Index of Lexical Diversity was associated with the frequency of references to verbs of desire. The results of regression analyses suggest that not only the development of subordinate sentences with complement is associated with genuine mental references to desires and beliefs, but the development of lexical skills as well.

T2  - Brain Research
AB  - Studies of first (L1) and second (L2) language representation in the brain have not identified the timing and locations of neural regions involved in L1 and L2 processing. Magnetoencephalography offers high spatial and temporal resolution and can be employed to disentangle subtle timing and neural control differences between L1 and L2 use. We tested bilingual adults in the MEG as they completed a picture verb generation task in L1 and L2. We found the expected progression of activation from occipital to temporal to inferior frontal areas. We also observed the following differences. A sustained insula and early cingulate event-related desynchrony was observed only with L2; the fMRI literature suggests that the former reflects an activation, and the latter an inhibition, sub-process for language selection. L2 processes exhibited a lag and were bilateral compared to L1 processes. Finally, L1 and L2 activated adjacent language control in dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex.

AB  - In recent years an increasing number of studies focus on the issue of early diagnosis and intervention. At the same time, a large number of special service units for early psychosis have been established around the world especially in Australia, USA, UK, Germany etc. Recently, similar units operate in Greece also. The Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association in its latest edition in 2013 (DSM-5), introduced the category 'Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome' (APS) for people with early psychotic experiences in the section: 'Conditions for further study'. This new category has specific criteria and describes a situation. In which a person displays psychotic symptoms in an attenuated form, with quite unaffected reality testing, but not qualifying a diagnosis of schizophrenic spectrum. The clinical expression of APS should be differentiated with several well known psychiatric disorders such as: brief psychotic disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, major depression with psychotic features, adolescence adjustment disorders, drug use, etc. The 'Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome' occurs mainly in adolescence and in young adulthood. The mean percentage of transition to psychosis for these individuals is estimated at 36%, three years after the onset of initial symptoms, while the risk of transition to psychosis, although smaller, seems to remain up to ten years later. For some other individuals, transition to other psychiatric disorders occurs, such as depression with psychotic elements, or bipolar disorder, while a significant number of them will not transmit to even more serious disorders. At the biological level, studies focused in brain's neuroimaging, suggest significant volumetric differences among people at high risk for psychosis who later develop psychosis compared to those who don't, while studies of psychophysiological indicators or/and genetic markers show promising results for the identification of relevant parameters indicating the transition to psychosis. Although an heterogeneous population, people with APS, show significant difficulties in social, professional and cognitive level, that should be therapeutically addressed. In an attempt to improve the clinical status of these individuals, to delay or even to prevent a psychotic episode, a series of Interventions have been used by psychiatrists. These interventions include: (a) administration of drugs, especially atypical antipsychotics or antidepressants in low dosage, (b) administration of non-pharmaceutical supplements (e.g. omega-3 ), (c) psychotherapeutic interventions, mainly cognitive behavior therapy and (d) a combination of the above. Many questions need to be answered such as, the period of therapeutic intervention, identification of indicators (biological or/and clinical) that may determine the most suited for the APS individuals therapeutic interventions or, that may foresee, to prevent the transition to psychosis. Thus, the continuation of research in populations of APS individuals in multiple levels is necessary. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: We investigated the relationship between partial epilepsy, MRI findings, and atypical language representation. Methods: A total of 102 patients (4 to 55 years) with left hemisphere epileptogenic zones were evaluated using three fMRI language tasks obtained at 1.5 or 3T with EPI BOLD techniques: verbal fluency, reading comprehension, and auditory comprehension. fMRI maps were visually interpreted at a standard threshold and rated as left or atypical language. Results: Atypical language dominance occurred in 30 patients (29%) and varied with MRI type (p < 0.01). Atypical language representation occurred in 36% (13/36) with normal MRI, 21% (6/29) with mesial temporal sclerosis, 14% (4/28) with focal cortical lesions (dysplasia, tumor, vascular malformation), and all (6/6) with a history of stroke. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found handedness, seizure onset, and MRI type accounted for much of the variance in language activation patterns (χ² = 24.09, p < 0.01). Atypical language was more prevalent in patients with early seizure onset (43.2%, p < 0.05) and atypical handedness (60%, p < 0.01). None of the three clinical factors were correlated with each other (p > 0.40). Patients with atypical language had lower verbal abilities (F = 6.96, p = 0.01) and a trend toward lower nonverbal abilities (F = 3.58, p = 0.06). There were no differences in rates of atypical language across time, age groups, or MRI scanner. Conclusion: Early seizure onset and atypical handedness, as well as the location and nature of pathologic substrate, are important factors in language reorganization.

AB  - Early multisensory perceptual experiences shape the abilities of infants to perform sociallyrelevant visual categorization, such as the extraction of gender, age, and emotion from faces. Here, we investigated whether multisensory perception of gender is influenced by infant-directed (IDS) or adult-directed (ADS) speech. Six-, 9-, and 12-month-old infants saw side-by-side silent video-clips of talking faces (a male and a female) and heard either a soundtrack of a female or a male voice telling a story in IDS or ADS. Infants participated in only one condition, either IDS or ADS. Consistent with earlier work, infants displayed advantages in matching female relative to male faces and voices. Moreover, the new finding that emerged in the current study was that extraction of gender from face and voice was stronger at 6 months with ADS than with IDS, whereas at 9 and 12 months, matching did not differ for IDS versus ADS. The results indicate that the ability to perceive gender in audiovisual speech is influenced by speech manner. Our data suggest that infants may extract multisensory gender information developmentally earlier when looking at adults engaged in conversation with other adults (i.e., ADS) than when adults are directly talking to them (i.e., IDS). Overall, our findings imply that the circumstances of social interaction may shape early multisensory abilities to perceive gender. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We examined autobiographical memory performance in two patients with semantic dementia using a novel measure, the Autobiographical Interview [Levine, Svoboda, Hay, Winocur, & Moscovitch (2002). Aging and autobiographical memory: Dissociating episodic from semantic retrieval. Psychology and Aging, 17,677-689], that is capable of dissociating episodic and personal semantic recall under varying levels of retrieval support. Earlier reports indicated that patients with semantic dementia demonstrate autobiographical episodic memory loss following a 'reverse gradient' by which recent memories are preserved relative to remote memories. We found limited evidence for this pattern at conditions of low retrieval support. When structured probing was provided, patients' autobiographical memory performance was similar to that of controls. Retesting of one patient after 1 year indicated that retrieval support was insufficient to bolster performance following progressive prefrontal volume loss, as documented with quantified structural neuroimaging. These findings are discussed in relation to theories of limbic-neocortical interaction in autobiographical memory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a naturalistic joint attention scenario to evaluate two, alternative hypotheses concerning the social brain. The first, Content Specific Attribution hypothesis, was that core regions previously identified as being involved in social cognition also participate in representing the contents of another mind. The second, Dual Role hypothesis, was that extrastriate, category-specific visual regions respond to a visible stimulus of a specific category and to the same stimulus occluded, but when it appears to be the focus of another person's visual attention. Participants viewed category-specific stimuli (Place and Body images) to localize the extrastriate body area (EBA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA). Then, they observed a computerized character viewing each stimulus category, occluded from the participant's view. In support of the Content Specific Attribution hypothesis, whole-brain analyses revealed that viewing someone else looking at an occluded picture of a body activated brain regions previously associated with components of social cognition more than viewing someone else looking at an occluded picture of a place. Counter to the Dual Role hypothesis, functional region of interest (ROI) analyses revealed that the EBA and PPA were not clearly involved in representing what the character was seeing.

T2  - Developmental Science
AB  - Skilled reading depends on recognizing words efficiently in isolation (word‐level processing; WL) and extracting meaning from text (discourse‐level processing; DL); deficiencies in either result in poor reading. FMRI has revealed consistent overlapping networks in word and passage reading, as well as unique regions for DL processing; however, less is known about how WL and DL processes interact. Here we examined functional connectivity from seed regions derived from where BOLD signal overlapped during word and passage reading in 38 adolescents ranging in reading ability, hypothesizing that even though certain regions support word‐ and higher‐level language, connectivity patterns from overlapping regions would be task modulated. Results indeed revealed that the left‐lateralized semantic and working memory (WM) seed regions showed task‐dependent functional connectivity patterns: during DL processes, semantic and WM nodes all correlated with the left angular gyrus, a region implicated in semantic memory/coherence building. In contrast, during WL, these nodes coordinated with a traditional WL area (left occipitotemporal region). In addition, these WL and DL findings were modulated by decoding and comprehension abilities, respectively, with poorer abilities correlating with decreased connectivity. Findings indicate that key regions may uniquely contribute to multiple levels of reading; we speculate that these connectivity patterns may be especially salient for reading outcomes and intervention response.

AB  - Background: Data-driven approaches can capture behavioral and biological variation currently unaccounted for by contemporary diagnostic categories, thereby enhancing the ability of neurobiological studies to characterize brain-behavior relationships. Methods: A community-ascertained sample of individuals (N = 347, 18–59 years of age) completed a battery of behavioral measures, psychiatric assessment, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a cross-sectional design. Bootstrap-based exploratory factor analysis was applied to 49 phenotypic subscales from 10 measures. Hybrid hierarchical clustering was applied to resultant factor scores to identify nested groups. Adjacent groups were compared via independent samples t tests and chi-square tests of factor scores, syndrome scores, and psychiatric prevalence. Multivariate distance matrix regression examined functional connectome differences between adjacent groups. Results: Reduction yielded six factors, which explained 77.8% and 65.4% of the variance in exploratory and constrained exploratory models, respectively. Hybrid hierarchical clustering of these six factors identified two, four, and eight nested groups (i.e., phenotypic communities). At the highest clustering level, the algorithm differentiated functionally adaptive and maladaptive groups. At the middle clustering level, groups were separated by problem type (maladaptive groups; internalizing vs. externalizing problems) and behavioral type (adaptive groups; sensation-seeking vs. extraverted/emotionally stable). Unique phenotypic profiles were also evident at the lowest clustering level. Group comparisons exhibited significant differences in intrinsic functional connectivity at the highest clustering level in somatomotor, thalamic, basal ganglia, and limbic networks. Conclusions: Data-driven approaches for identifying homogenous subgroups, spanning typical function to dysfunction, not only yielded clinically meaningful groups, but also captured behavioral and neurobiological variation among healthy individuals.

AB  - Subtle disorders of neuronal migration occur in the brains of some dyslexic patients who present developmental language disorder (DLD) during early childhood. This study investigated a possible neuroanatomical substrate based on neuroimaging evaluation in children with DLD. The authors obtained psychological assessment, language evaluation, neurologic examination, and neuroimaging investigation for 15 children who met inclusion and exclusion criteria (at least 4 yrs old, a primary complaint of language delay, normal hearing, IQ >70, no severe motor or cognitive handicap). The Ss were 4-14 yrs old. Six patients presented diffuse polymicrogyria (PMG) around the entire extent of the sylvian fissure on MRI. They had severe clinical manifestation of DLD: they did not speak at all or had mixed phonologic-syntactic deficit syndrome. Six Ss presented PMG restricted to the posterior aspects of the parietal regions, and they had a milder form of DLD, mainly phonologic programing deficit syndrome. It is concluded that DLD can be associated with polymicrogyria and that clinical manifestation varies according to the extension of cortical abnormality. A subtle form of posterior parietal polymicrogyria presenting as developmental language disorder is a mild form of perisylvian syndrome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Behavioural Brain Research
AB  - Choosing the correct response from a subset of alternatives is a fundamental problem and particularly demanding where conflicting response tendencies are evident. One phenomenon in this context is the congruency sequence-(Gratton effect), for which different theoretical explanations have been put forward. A critical aspect that differs between these explanations is the expectancy of what will happen in forthcoming trials. In the current study we examine the relevance of expectancy for sequence congruency effects and related neurophysiological processes using a flanker task in which we manipulate the probability that the n +1 trial presents the same stimulus–response mapping than the n trial. We ask what cognitive subprocesses involved in response selection may be modulated by expectancy effects. To distinguish different subprocesses probably modulated by expectancy effects we use event-related potentials (ERPs) in combination with source localization techniques. The data show that cognitive subprocesses modulated by expectancy depend on the nature of expected transitions between succeeding trials. Expectancy effects only affected trial transitions within the same category (i.e., ‘compatible-compatible’ and ‘incompatible-incompatible’), but not between compatibility categories (i.e., ‘compatible-incompatible’ and ‘incompatible-compatible’). On compatible trial transitions attentional selection processes operating via the precuneus mediated expectancy effects, while on incompatible trial transitions inhibitory processes were modulated that were mediated via the medial and middle frontal gyrus, the orbitofrontal cortex, the insular and the parahippocampal gyrus. Conflict monitoring processes per se were not modulated by expectancy effects. The data shows that there are different subprocesses underlying the influence of expectancy on sequence effects during response selection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have revealed various ADHD-related dysfunctional brain regions, with heterogeneous findings across studies. Here, we used novel meta-analytic data-driven approaches to characterize the function and connectivity profile of ADHD-related dysfunctional regions consistently detected across studies. Methods: We first conducted an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 24 task-based fMRI studies in adults with ADHD. Each ADHD-related dysfunctional region resulting from the activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was then analyzed using functional decoding based on ~7500 fMRI experiments in the BrainMap database. This approach allows mapping brain regions to functions not necessarily tested in individual studies, thus suggesting possible novel functions for those regions. Additionally, ADHD-related dysfunctional regions were clustered based on their functional coactivation profiles across all the experiments stored in BrainMap (meta-analytic connectivity modeling). Results: ADHD-related hypoactivation was found in the left putamen, left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), left temporal pole, and right caudate. Functional decoding mapped the left putamen to cognitive aspects of music perception/reproduction and the left temporal lobe to language semantics; both these regions clustered together on the basis of their meta-analytic functional connectivity. Left inferior gyrus mapped to executive function tasks; right caudate mapped to both executive function tasks and music-related processes. Conclusions: Our study provides meta-analytic support to the hypothesis that, in addition to well-known deficits in typical executive functions, impairment in processes related to music perception/reproduction and language semantics may be involved in the pathophysiology of adult ADHD.

AB  - Pediatric white matter disorders can be distinguished into well‐defined leukoencephalopathies, and undefined leukoencephalopathies. The first category may be subdivided into: (a) hypomyelinating disorders; (b) dysmyelinating disorders; (c) leukodystrophies; (d) disorders related to cystic degeneration of myelin; and (e) disorders secondary to axonal damage. The second category, representing up to 50% of leukoencephalopathies in childhood, requires a multidisciplinar approach in order to define novel homogeneous subgroups of patients, possibly representing 'new genetic disorders' (such as megalencephalic leukoencepahlopathy with subcortical cysts and vanishing white matter disease that have recently been identified). In the majority of cases, pediatric white matter disorders are inherited diseases. An integrated description of the clinical, neuroimaging and pathophysiological features is crucial for categorizing myelin disorders and better understanding their genetic basis. A review of the genetic disorders affecting white matter in the pediatric age, including some novel entities, is provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating hemispheric dominance for language have shown that hemispheric specialization increases with age. We employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate these effects as a function of normal development. In sum, 22 healthy children aged 7-16 years were investigated using two language tasks: a verb-generation (VG) task and a vowel-identification (VI) task. Significant hemispheric differences were found for both tasks in cerebral language areas using oscillatory MEG spectral analyses, confirming the MEG's ability to detect hemispheric specialization for language in children. Additionally, a significant increase of this lateralization as a function of age was observed for both tasks. As performance in the VI task showed no correlation with age, this increase seems to be unrelated to performance. These results confirm an increase in hemispheric specialization as a function of normal brain maturation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - To assess the effects of reading instruction on fMRI brain activation in children with dyslexia, the authors developed tasks to probe brain activation during phoneme mapping and morpheme mapping. Ten children with dyslexia and 11 normal readers performed these tasks during fMRI scanning. Children with dyslexia then completed 28 hours of comprehensive reading instruction. Scans were repeated on both dyslexic and control subjects using the same tasks. Results indicate that before treatment, children with dyslexia showed less activation than controls in left middle and inferior frontal gyri, right superior frontal gyrus, left middle and inferior temporal gyri, and bilateral superior parietal regions for phoneme mapping. Activation was significantly reduced for children with dyslexia on the initial morpheme mapping scan in left middle frontal gyrus, right superior parietal, and fusiform/occipital region. Treatment was associated with improved reading scores and increased brain activation during both tasks. These results suggest that behavioral gains from comprehensive reading instruction are associated with changes in brain function during performance of language tasks.

T2  - Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology
AB  - Event-related potential (ERP), reaction time (RT), and response accuracy measures were obtained during rhyming and semantic classification of spoken words in 10 average reading (aged 9.1–13.1 yrs) and 9 impaired reading (aged 9.5–14.0 yrs) children and adolescents. The behavioral measures of classification did not distinguish the groups. In the ERPs, rhyme processing produced more pronounced group differences than did semantic processing at about 480 msec, with a relatively more negative distribution for the impaired readers at centroparietal sites. At about 800 msec in both classification tasks, the impaired readers displayed a late positivity that was delayed in latency and of larger amplitude at frontal sites than that for the average readers. ERP findings suggest that the categorization of spoken words for meaning and sound result in increasingly more aberrant correlates of these processing demands in reading-impaired children.

AB  - To address inconsistencies in the literature on memory in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we report the first ever meta-analysis of short-term memory (STM) and episodic long-term memory (LTM) in ASD, evaluating the effects of type of material, type of retrieval and the role of interitem relations. Analysis of 64 studies comparing individuals with ASD and typical development (TD) showed greater difficulties in ASD compared with TD individuals in STM (Hedges’ g = −0.53, 95% CI [−0.90, −0.16], p = .005, I² = 96%) compared with LTM (g = −0.30, 95% CI [−0.42, −0.17], p < .00001, I² = 24%), a small difficulty in verbal LTM (g = −0.21, p = .01), contrasting with a medium difficulty for visual LTM (g = −0.41, p = .0002) in ASD compared with TD individuals. We also found a general diminution in free recall compared with cued recall and recognition (LTM, free recall: g = −0.38, p < .00001, cued recall: g = −0.08, p = .58, recognition: g = −0.15, p = .16; STM, free recall: g = −0.59, p = .004, recognition: g = −0.33, p = .07). We discuss these results in terms of their relation to semantic memory. The limited diminution in verbal LTM and preserved overall recognition and cued recall (supported retrieval) may result from a greater overlap of these tasks with semantic long-term representations which are overall preserved in ASD. By contrast, difficulties in STM or free recall may result from less overlap with the semantic system or may involve additional cognitive operations and executive demands. These findings highlight the need to support STM functioning in ASD and acknowledge the potential benefit of using verbal materials at encoding and broader forms of memory support at retrieval to enhance performance.

AB  - Rationale: Methylphenidate, the most common treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is increasingly used by healthy individuals as a 'smart drug' to enhance cognitive abilities like attention. A key feature of (selective) attention is the ability to ignore irrelevant but salient information in the environment (distractors). Although crucial for cognitive performance, until now, it is not known how the use of methylphenidate affects resistance to attentional capture by distractors. Objectives: The present study aims to clarify how methylphenidate affects distractor suppression in healthy individuals. Methods: The effect of methylphenidate (20 mg) on distractor suppression was assessed in healthy subjects (N = 20), in a within-subject double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. We used a visuospatial attention task with target faces flanked by strong (faces) or weak distractors (scrambled faces). Results: Methylphenidate increased accuracy on trials that required gender identification of target face stimuli (methylphenidate 88.9 ± 1.4 [mean ± SEM], placebo 86.0 ± 1.2 %; p = .003), suggesting increased processing of the faces. At the same time, however, methylphenidate increased reaction time when the target face was flanked by a face distractor relative to a scrambled face distractor (methylphenidate 34.9 ± 3.73, placebo 26.7 ± 2.84 ms; p = .027), suggesting enhanced attentional capture by distractors with task-relevant features. Conclusions: We conclude that methylphenidate amplifies salience of task-relevant information at the level of the stimulus category. This leads to enhanced processing of the target (faces) but also increased attentional capture by distractors drawn from the same category as the target.

AB  - Investigations of the neural correlates of face recognition have typically used old/new paradigms where subjects learn to recognize new faces or identify famous faces. Familiar faces, however, include one's own face, partner's and parents' faces. Using event-related fMRI, we examined the neural correlates of these personally familiar faces. Ten participants were presented with photographs of own, partner, parents, famous and unfamiliar faces and responded to a distinct target. Whole brain, two regions of interest (fusiform gyrus and cingulate gyrus), and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Compared with baseline, all familiar faces activated the fusiform gyrus; own faces also activated occipital regions and the precuneus; partner faces activated similar areas, but in addition, the parahippocampal gyrus, middle superior temporal gyri and middle frontal gyrus. Compared with unfamiliar faces, only personally familiar faces activated the cingulate gyrus and the extent of activation varied with face category. Partner faces also activated the insula, amygdala and thalamus. Regions of interest analyses and laterality indices showed anatomical distinctions of processing the personally familiar faces within the fusiform and cingulate gyri. Famous faces were right lateralized whereas personally familiar faces, particularly partner and own faces, elicited bilateral activations. Regression analyses show experiential predictors modulated with neural activity related to own and partner faces. Thus, personally familiar faces activated the core visual areas and extended frontal regions, related to semantic and person knowledge and the extent and areas of activation varied with face type.

AB  - Behavioral research has suggested a trade-off relationship between individual recognition and race categorization of own- and other-race faces, which is an important behavioral marker of face processing expertise. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this trade-off. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodology, we concurrently asked participants to recognize and categorize own- and other-race faces to examine the neural correlates of this trade-off relationship. We found that for other-race faces, the fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA) responded more to recognition than categorization, whereas for own-race faces, the responses were equal for the 2 tasks. The right superior temporal sulcus (STS) responses were the opposite to those of the FFA and OFA. Further, recognition enhanced the functional connectivity from the right FFA to the right STS, whereas categorization enhanced the functional connectivity from the right OFA to the right STS. The modulatory effects of these 2 couplings were negatively correlated. Our findings suggested that within the core face processing network, although recognizing and categorizing own- and other-race faces activated the same neural substrates, there existed neural trade-offs whereby their activations and functional connectivities were modulated by face race type and task demand due to one’s differential processing expertise with own- and other-race faces.

AU  - Nagarajan, Lakshmi

T2  - Journal of Child Neurology
AB  - There is a high incidence of mortality and neurodevelopmental sequelae in babies with neonatal seizures. The electroencephalography (EEG) background has been shown to be an excellent predictor of outcome by most studies, with a few suggesting limited value in prognostication. Previous studies suggest poor prognosis with severely abnormal backgrounds, but prediction was difficult with moderate abnormalities. The proposed numerical scoring system for the EEG background provides an objective method of evaluation with improved reproducibility, categorization, and prognostication. Our study showed that the numerical score of EEG background was a good predictor of outcome. Higher numerical scores reflecting greater abnormality of background EEG were associated with increasing incidence of mortality, neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing impairment, and epilepsy. The numerical score also correlated with neuroimaging abnormalities. A numerical EEG score can help target interventional strategies for neonatal seizures.

TI  - Perceiving the writing sequence of Chinese characters: An ERP investigation
AU  - Qiu, Yinchen
AU  - Zhou, Xiaolin
T2  - NeuroImage
AB  - The neural dynamics in perceiving well-learned sequences and its modulation by task demand were investigated in this study in which participants were asked to observe stroke-by-stroke display of Chinese characters composed of two radicals while their brain activity was monitored with the event-related potential (ERP) technique. Experiment 1 used an accuracy judgment task that would draw participants' attention to the violation of the writing sequence whereas Experiment 2 required participants to judge the completion of the display and thus the more automatic aspects of sequence processing could be revealed. In Experiment 1, the within-radical boundary reversal produced bilateral posterior N2 enhancement and the cross-boundary reversal elicited a left N2 effect and right posterior N2 reduction on the critical stroke. Both types of reversal elicited P3 effects on the critical stroke and sustained negativity effects on the following stroke, with the size being larger for the cross-boundary reversal. In Experiment 2, in addition to the P3 effects, the within-boundary reversal elicited a left posterior N2 effect and the cross-boundary reversal elicited right posterior N2 reduction on the critical stroke. Moreover, on the following stroke, the cross-boundary reversal elicited a right N2 effect and both types of reversal elicited sustained positivity effects. These findings demonstrate that native Chinese readers use their sequential knowledge to predict upcoming strokes in perceiving the writing of characters and to construct appropriate representations for the action sequence regardless of whether such predictions and constructions are required by the task.

AB  - Faces are salient social stimuli whose features attract a stereotypical pattern of fixations. The implications of this gaze behavior for perception and brain activity are largely unknown. Here, we characterize and quantify a retinotopic bias implied by typical gaze behavior toward faces, which leads to eyes and mouth appearing most often in the upper and lower visual field, respectively. We found that the adult human visual system is tuned to these contingencies. In two recognition experiments, recognition performance for isolated face parts was better when they were presented at typical, rather than reversed, visual field locations. The recognition cost of reversed locations was equal to ~60% of that for whole face inversion in the same sample. Similarly, an fMRI experiment showed that patterns of activity evoked by eye and mouth stimuli in the right inferior occipital gyrus could be separated with significantly higher accuracy when these features were presented at typical, rather than reversed, visual field locations. Our findings demonstrate that human face perception is determined not only by the local position of features within a face context, but by whether features appear at the typical retinotopic location given normal gaze behavior. Such location sensitivity may reflect fine-tuning of category-specific visual processing to retinal input statistics. Our findings further suggest that retinotopic heterogeneity might play a role for face inversion effects and for the understanding of conditions affecting gaze behavior toward faces, such as autism spectrum disorders and congenital prosopagnosia.

AB  - Dysfunctional patterns of activation in brain reward networks have been suggested as a core element in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear whether this dysfunction is specific to schizophrenia or can be continuously observed across persons with different levels of nonclinical and clinical symptom expression. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether the pattern of reward system dysfunction is consistent with a dimensional or categorical model of psychosis-like symptom expression. 23 patients with schizophrenia and 37 healthy control participants with varying levels of psychosis-like symptoms, separated into 3 groups of low, medium, and high symptom expression underwent event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a Cued Reinforcement Reaction Time task. We observed lower activation in the ventral striatum during the expectation of high vs no reward to be associated with higher symptom expression across all participants. No significant difference between patients with schizophrenia and healthy participants with high symptom expression was found. However, connectivity between the ventral striatum and the medial orbitofrontal cortex was specifically reduced in patients with schizophrenia. Dysfunctional local activation of the ventral striatum depends less on diagnostic category than on the degree of symptom expression, therefore showing a pattern consistent with a psychosis continuum. In contrast, aberrant connectivity in the reward system is specific to patients with schizophrenia, thereby supporting a categorical view. Thus, the results of the present study provide evidence for both continuous and discontinuous neural substrates of symptom expression across patients with schizophrenia and the general population.

T2  - Neuropsychologia
AB  - Amnesic patients with bilateral hippocampal damage sustained in adulthood are generally unable to construct scenes in their imagination. By contrast, patients with developmental amnesia (DA), where hippocampal damage was acquired early in life, have preserved performance on this task, although the reason for this sparing is unclear. One possibility is that residual function in remnant hippocampal tissue is sufficient to support basic scene construction in DA. Such a situation was found in the one amnesic patient with adult-acquired hippocampal damage (P01) who could also construct scenes. Alternatively, DA patients’ scene construction might not depend on the hippocampus, perhaps being instead reliant on non-hippocampal regions and mediated by semantic knowledge. To adjudicate between these two possibilities, we examined scene construction during functional MRI (fMRI) in Jon, a well-characterised patient with DA who has previously been shown to have preserved scene construction. We found that when Jon constructed scenes he activated many of the regions known to be associated with imagining scenes in control participants including ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, retrosplenial and posterior parietal cortices. Critically, however, activity was not increased in Jon's remnant hippocampal tissue. Direct comparisons with a group of control participants and patient P01, confirmed that they activated their right hippocampus more than Jon. Our results show that a type of non-hippocampal dependent scene construction is possible and occurs in DA, perhaps mediated by semantic memory, which does not appear to involve the vivid visualisation of imagined scenes.

AB  - Background: Significant controversy has emerged concerning pediatric anxiety disorders. Some researchers question the justification for diagnosing and treating pediatric anxiety disorders, owing to concerns about the inappropriate medicalization of social problems. Others note the importance of diagnosis and treatment, given that pediatric anxiety disorders represent a strong risk factor for serious adult mental disorders. We examine the neural correlates of pediatric anxiety disorders, to consider the validity of the categorization scheme used in recent treatment studies. Methods: Using inclusion criteria derived from recent treatment trials, we compared gray matter volume throughout the brain in children with and without anxiety. Morphometric analyses used optimized voxel-based morphometry, an automated method for examining structural changes throughout the brain. Results: Reductions in left amygdala gray matter volume were noted for patients with anxiety disorders relative to comparison subjects. Conclusions: We discuss implications of these findings for current controversies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Memory tasks can be performed using multiple cognitive strategies, which are mediated by different brain systems. The transverse patterning (TP) task is dependent upon the integrity of the hippocampal system, however, we previously demonstrated successful TP following hippocampal damage using meaningful stimuli and relations (Moses, S.N., Ostreicher, M.L., Rosenbaum, R.S., Ryan, J.D., 2008. Successful transverse patterning in amnesia using semantic knowledge. Hippocampus 18, 121–124). Here, we used magnetoencephalgraphy (MEG) to directly observe the neural underpinnings of TP, and the changes that occur as stimuli and relations become more meaningful. In order to optimize our ability to detect signal from deep, non-dominant, brain sources we implemented the event-related synthetic aperture magnetometry minimum-variance beamformer algorithm (ER-SAM; Cheyne, D., Bakhtazad, L., Gaetz, W., 2006. Spatiotemporal mapping of cortical activity accompanying voluntary movements using an event-related beamforming approach. Human Brain Mapping 27, 213–229) coupled with the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate statistical approach (McIntosh, A.R., Bookstein, F.L., Haxby, J.V., Grady, C.L., 1996. Spatial pattern analysis of function brain images using partial least squares. NeuroImage 3, 143–157; McIntosh, A.R., Lobaugh, N.J., 2004. Partial least squares analysis of neuroimaging data: Applications and advances. NeuroImage 23, S250–S263). We found that increased meaningfulness elicited reduced bilateral hippocampal activation, along with increased activation of left prefrontal and temporal cortical structures, including inferior frontal (IFG), as well as anterior temporal and perirhinal cortices. These activation patterns may represent a shift towards reliance upon existing semantic knowledge. This shift likely permits successful TP performance with meaningful stimuli and relations following hippocampal damage. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Typical adult observers demonstrate enhanced behavioral sensitivity to human movement compared to animal movement. Yet, the neural underpinnings of this effect are unknown. We examined the tuning of brain mechanisms for the perception of biological motion to the social relevance of this category of motion by comparing neural response to human and non-human biological motion. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that the response of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) varies according to the social relevance of the motion, responding most strongly to those biological motions with the greatest social relevance (human > dog). During a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session, typical adults viewed veridical point-light displays of human, dog, and tractor motions created from motion capture data. A conjunction analysis identified regions of significant activation during biological motion perception relative to object motion. Within each of these regions, only one brain area, the right pSTS, revealed an enhanced response to human motion relative to dog motion. This finding demonstrates that the pSTS response is sensitive to the social relevance of a biological motion stimulus. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Xiang, Jing

T2  - Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology
AB  - A total of 8 participants were tested using magnetoencephalography for investigating the spatial, temporal, and frequency signatures of noun and verb processing in the brain. Visually presented nouns and verbs both activated the occipital, left posterior temporal, and left inferior frontal cortices at a latency range of 106–329 ms in a frequency range of 24–98 Hz. Nouns activated the left posterior temporal area while verbs activated the inferior left frontal area at a latency range of 411–430 ms in a frequency range of 116–137 Hz. Nouns and verbs were processed in similar brain areas during early latency and relatively low frequency, but were processed in different brain areas during late latency and high frequency. The results indicate that there are distinct neural substrates underlying different aspects of the language system. This finding sheds light on the cerebral mechanisms of impairments of selective word categories in patients with brain damage in clinical neuropsychology.

T2  - Epilepsy & Behavior
AB  - Chronic and progressive brain injury, as seen in epilepsy, may alter brain networks that underlie cognitive functions. To evaluate the effect of epilepsy on language functions we investigated the neuroanatomical basis of semantic processing in patients with left (LHE) or right (RHE) hemispheric onset epilepsy using semantic decision fMRI paradigm and group independent component analysis (ICA); we then compared the results of our investigations with language networks in healthy subjects examined with the same language task (Kim K, Karunanayaka P, Privitera M, Holland S, Szaflarski J. Semantic association investigated with fMRI and independent component analysis. In press). Group ICA is a data-driven technique capable of revealing the functional organization of the human brain based on fMRI data. In addition to providing functional connectivity information, ICA can also provide information about the temporal dynamics of underlying networks subserving specific cognitive functions. In this study, we implemented two complementary analyses to investigate group differences in underlying network dynamics based on associated independent component (IC) time courses (a priori defined criterion or a posteriori identified maximum likelihood descriptor). We detected several differences between healthy controls and patients with epilepsy not previously observed with standard fMRI analysis methods. Our analyses confirmed the presence of different effects of LHE or RHE on the behavior of the language network. In particular, a major difference was noted in the nodes subserving verbal encoding and retrieval in the bilateral medial temporal regions. These effects were dependent on the side of the epilepsy onset; that is, effects were different with left or right hemispheric epilepsy. These findings may explain the differences in verbal and nonverbal memory abilities between patients with left and those with right hemispheric epilepsy. Further, although the effects on other nodes of the network were more subtle, several deviations from normal network function were observed in patients with LHE (e.g., alterations in the functions of the primarily left frontotemporal network module) or in patients with RHE (e.g., differences in the medial retrosplenial module responsible for mental imagery or in the anterior cingulate module subserving attention control). These findings not only highlight the negative effects of epilepsy on the main left hemispheric language network nodes in patients with LHE, but also document the effects of epilepsy on other language network nodes whether exerted by LHE or RHE. Further, these results document the advantages of using group ICA for investigating the effects of disease state (e.g., epilepsy) on the network subserving cognitive processing and provide an interesting avenue for further exploration.

TI  - Three things to remember if you are a functional magnetic resonance imaging researcher of face processing in autism spectrum disorders
AU  - Klin, Ami
T2  - Biological Psychiatry
AB  - Comments on the article by K. Pierce and E. Redcay (see record [rid]2008-12975-002[/rid]), which measured brain activity (using fMRI imaging) while 6- to 12-year-old children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and typical control subjects viewed pictures of faces. Pierce and Redcay raise a number of important questions that every fMRI researcher of face processing in ASD should consider in their studies: (1) Is visual attention a confound in studies of neural responses to faces in ASD?; (2) Is motivation a confound in studies of neural responses to faces in ASD?; and (3) Is the fusiform gyrus a brain module exclusively tied to face processing? Pierce and Redcay's results are important in that they bring us to a higher level of scrutiny of fMRI studies of face processing in ASD. It is hoped that their allusion to important developmental considerations will prompt us to remember that our brains not only reflect what we are now, they also reflect what we have been.

TI  - When three is not  some: On the pragmatics of numerals
AU  - Shetreet, Einat
AU  - Chierchia, Gennaro
AU  - Gaab, Nadine
T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - Both numerals and quantifiers (like some) have more than one possible interpretation (i.e., weak and strong interpretations). Some studies have found similar behavior for numerals and quantifiers, whereas others have shown critical differences. It is, therefore, debated whether they are processed in the same way. A previous fMRI investigation showed that the left inferior frontal gyrus is linked to the computation of the strong interpretation of quantifiers (derived by a scalar implicature) and that the left middle frontal gyrus and the medial frontal gyrus are linked to processing the mismatch between the strong interpretation of quantifiers and the context in which they are presented. In the current study, we attempted to characterize the similarities and differences between numbers and quantifiers by examining brain activation patterns related to the processing of numerals in these brain regions. When numbers were presented in a mismatch context (i.e., where their strong interpretation did not match the context), they elicited brain activations similar to those previously observed with quantifiers in the same context type. Conversely, in a match context (i.e., where both interpretations of the scalar item matched the context), numbers elicited a different activation pattern than the one observed with quantifiers: Left inferior frontal gyrus activations in response to the match condition showed decrease for numbers (but not for quantifiers). Our results support previous findings suggesting that, although they share some features, numbers and quantifiers are processed differently. We discuss our results in light of various theoretical approaches linked to the representation of numerals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are  neuroimaging modalities typically used for evaluating brain changes in Alzheimer's  disease (AD). Due to their complementary nature, their combination can provide more  accurate AD diagnosis or prognosis. In this work, we apply a multi-modal imaging  machine-learning framework to enhance AD classification and prediction of diagnosis  of subject-matched gray matter MRI and Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET data related  to 58 AD, 108 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 120 healthy elderly (HE) subjects  from the Australian imaging, biomarkers and lifestyle (AIBL) dataset. Specifically,  we combined a Dartel algorithm to enhance anatomical registration with multi-kernel  learning (MKL) technique, yielding an average of >95% accuracy for three binary  classification problems: AD-vs.-HE, MCI-vs.-HE and AD-vs.-MCI, a considerable  improvement from individual modality approach. Consistent with t-contrasts, the MKL  weight maps revealed known brain regions associated with AD, i.e.,  (para)hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral temporal gyrus.  Importantly, MKL regression analysis provided excellent predictions of diagnosis of  individuals by r(2) = 0.86. In addition, we found significant correlations between  the MKL classification and delayed memory recall scores with r(2) = 0.62 (p < 0.01).  Interestingly, outliers in the regression model for diagnosis were mainly converter  samples with a higher likelihood of converting to the inclined diagnostic category.  Overall, our work demonstrates the successful application of MKL with Dartel on  combined neuromarkers from different neuroimaging modalities in the AIBL data. This  lends further support in favor of machine learning approach in improving the  diagnosis and risk prediction of AD.

AB  - Nouns and verbs are fundamental grammatical building blocks of all languages.  Studies of brain-damaged patients and healthy individuals have demonstrated that  verb processing can be dissociated from noun processing at a neuroanatomical level.  In cases where bilingual patients have a noun or verb deficit, the deficit has been  observed in both languages. This suggests that the noun-verb distinction may be  based on neural components that are common across languages. Here we investigated  the cortical organization of grammatical categories in healthy, early  Spanish-English bilinguals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a  morphophonological alternation task. Four regions showed greater activity for verbs  than for nouns in both languages: left posterior middle temporal gyrus (LMTG), left  middle frontal gyrus (LMFG), pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), and right  middle occipital gyrus (RMOG); no regions showed greater activation for nouns.  Multi-voxel pattern analysis within verb-specific regions showed indistinguishable  activity patterns for English and Spanish, indicating language-invariant bilingual  processing. In LMTG and LMFG, patterns were more similar within than across  grammatical category, both within and across languages, indicating  language-invariant grammatical class information. These results suggest that the  neural substrates underlying verb-specific processing are largely independent of  language in bilinguals, both at the macroscopic neuroanatomical level and at the  level of voxel activity patterns.

AB  - This study examined the feasibility of decoding semantic information from human  cortical activity. Four human subjects undergoing presurgical brain mapping and  seizure foci localization participated in this study. Electrocorticographic (ECoG)  signals were recorded while the subjects performed simple language tasks involving  semantic information processing, such as a picture naming task where subjects named  pictures of objects belonging to different semantic categories. Robust high-gamma  band (60-120 Hz) activation was observed at the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG)  and the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) with a temporal  sequence corresponding to speech production and perception. Furthermore, Gaussian  Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers, two commonly used machine  learning algorithms for pattern recognition, were able to predict the semantic  category of an object using cortical activity captured by ECoG electrodes covering  the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. These findings have implications for  both basic neuroscience research and development of semantic-based brain-computer  interface systems (BCI) that can help individuals with severe motor or communication  disorders to express their intention and thoughts.

AB  - Both categorization and segmentation processes play a crucial role in face  perception. However, the functional relation between these subprocesses is currently  unclear. The present study investigates the temporal relation between  segmentation-related and category-selective responses in the brain, using  electroencephalography (EEG). Surface segmentation and category content were both  manipulated using texture-defined objects, including faces. This allowed us to study  brain activity related to segmentation and to categorization. In the main  experiment, participants viewed texture-defined objects for a duration of 800 ms.  EEG results revealed that segmentation-related responses precede category-selective  responses. Three additional experiments revealed that the presence and timing of  categorization depends on stimulus properties and presentation duration.  Photographic objects were presented for a long and short (92 ms) duration and evoked  fast category-selective responses in both cases. On the other hand, presentation of  texture-defined objects for a short duration only evoked segmentation-related but no  category-selective responses. Category-selective responses were much slower when  evoked by texture-defined than by photographic objects. We suggest that in case of  categorization of objects under suboptimal conditions, such as when low-level  stimulus properties are not sufficient for fast object categorization, segmentation  facilitates the slower categorization process.

AB  - Two experiments document that conceptual knowledge influences 3-year-olds' extension  of novel words. In Experiment 1, when objects were described as having conceptual  properties typical of artifacts, children extended novel labels for these objects on  the basis of shape alone. When the very same objects were described as having  conceptual properties typical of animate kinds, children extended novel labels for  these objects on the basis of both shape and texture. Moreover, providing a salient  perceptual cue (Experiment 2) did not interfere with children's reliance on  conceptual information in extending novel words: when an object with eyes was  labeled with a novel word in the context of a story describing the object as an  artifact, children extended the label on the basis of shape alone (i.e. as though  the object were an artifact). These results, which challenge directly the position  that 'dumb attentional mechanisms' can account for word learning, stand as evidence  for the central role of conceptual information in mapping words to meaning.

AB  - The rapid extraction of facial identity and emotional expressions is critical for  adapted social interactions. These biologically relevant abilities have been  associated with early neural responses on the face sensitive N170 component.  However, whether all facial expressions uniformly modulate the N170, and whether  this effect occurs only when emotion categorization is task-relevant, is still  unclear. To clarify this issue, we recorded high-resolution electrophysiological  signals while 22 observers perceived the six basic expressions plus neutral. We used  a repetition suppression paradigm, with an adaptor followed by a target face  displaying the same identity and expression (trials of interest). We also included  catch trials to which participants had to react, by varying identity  (identity-task), expression (expression-task) or both (dual-task) on the target  face. We extracted single-trial Repetition Suppression (stRS) responses using a  data-driven spatiotemporal approach with a robust hierarchical linear model to  isolate adaptation effects on the trials of interest. Regardless of the task, fear  was the only expression modulating the N170, eliciting the strongest stRS responses.  This observation was corroborated by distinct behavioral performance during the  catch trials for this facial expression. Altogether, our data reinforce the view  that fear elicits distinct neural processes in the brain, enhancing attention and  facilitating the early coding of faces.

TI  - Brain meta-state transitions demarcate thoughts across task contexts exposing the  mental noise of trait neuroticism.
AU  - Tseng, Julie
AU  - Poppenk, Jordan
T2  - Nature communications
AB  - Researchers have observed large-scale neural meta-state transitions that align to  narrative events during movie-viewing. However, group or training-derived priors  have been needed to detect them. Here, we introduce methods to sample transitions  without any priors. Transitions detected by our methods predict narrative events,  are similar across task and rest, and are correlated with activation of regions  associated with spontaneous thought. Based on the centrality of semantics to  thought, we argue these transitions serve as general, implicit neurobiological  markers of new thoughts, and that their frequency, which is stable across contexts,  approximates participants' mentation rate. By enabling observation of idiosyncratic  transitions, our approach supports many applications, including phenomenological  access to the black box of resting cognition. To illustrate the utility of this  access, we regress resting fMRI transition rate and movie-viewing transition  conformity against trait neuroticism, thereby providing a first neural confirmation  of mental noise theory.

AB  - One of the most important social identities that children learn to define themselves  and others by is sex, becoming a salient social category by early childhood.  Although older children begin to show greater flexibility in their gendered  behaviors and attitudes, gender rigidity intensifies again around the time of  puberty. In the current study, we assessed behavioral and neural biases to sex  across a wide age group. Ninety-three youth (ages 7-17 years) provided behavioral  rating of same- and opposite-sex attitudes, and 52 youth (ages 4-18 years) underwent  an fMRI scan as they matched the emotion of same- and opposite-sex faces. We  demonstrate significant age-related behavioral biases of sex that are mediated by  differential amygdala response to opposite-sex relative to same-sex faces in  children, an effect that completely attenuates by the teenage years. Moreover, we  find a second peak in amygdala sensitivity to opposite-sex faces around the time of  puberty. Thus, the amygdala codes for developmentally dependent and motivationally  relevant social identification across development.

T2  - Neuroreport
AB  - We investigated the oscillatory neural correlates of auditory lexical processing in  healthy adults. Synthetic aperture magnetometry was used to characterize the timing  of event-related desynchronization (ERD)/event-related synchronization (ERS) in  superior temporal gyri following low-frequency and high-frequency words in contrast  to nonwords. ERS and ERD responses were found with both word and nonword stimuli.  Analysis of power revealed significantly elevated θ-α range (6-14 Hz) ERD in  response to words compared with nonwords (left hemisphere: 390-945 ms poststimulus).  Furthermore, a burst of ERS in the γ band (40-50 Hz, centered at 410 ms  poststimulus) distinguished high-frequency and low-frequency words, and also  displayed left-hemispheric enhancement following words. Results demonstrate a clear  neural correlate of lexical access and provide a basis for further study of  spectral-temporal brain activity during language processing.

AU  - Staufenberg, E. F.
AU  - Brown, S. W.
T2  - Seizure
AB  - Individuals with learning difficulties commonly suffer from concomitant conditions;  epilepsies constitute up to 35%. The prevalence of epileptic syndromes in learning  disabled people is less well documented. Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE)  occurs with many epileptic syndromes. It can present with insidious or paroxysmal  change of neurovegetative, behavioural, cognitive or affective symptoms which can  mistakenly be attributed to other causes. NCSE of generalized epilepsy syndromes can  show localizing features and NCSE of localization-related epilepsy can show  generalized epileptiform discharge patterns. We reviewed 14 residents' (< 20 years,  all learning disabled) EEG recordings in inter-ictal stages and in NCSE and conclude  that the current nosological grouping of NCSE does not ensure appropriate  categorization in a significant number of cases. We developed a revised NCSE  classification: (I) Generalized epileptic syndromes: (a) with no evidence of  lateralization inter-ictally or in NCSE; (b) with evidence of lateralization in NCSE  only. (II) Localization-related epileptic syndromes: (a) with evidence of  lateralization/focal activity in NCSE; (b) with evidence of generalized EEG patterns  when in NCSE only; (c) with transient forms: same individual shows generalized and  lateralized/focal NCSE activity in different EEGs. We suggest our system be tested  in larger studies for its sensitivity, reliability and validity.

AU  - Starr, Taylor B.

T2  - Current psychiatry reports
AB  - Recent research has modified both the conceptualization and treatment of eating  disorders. New diagnostic criteria reducing the "not otherwise specified" category  should facilitate the early recognition and treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) and  bulimia nervosa (BN). Technology-based studies identify AN and BN as "brain circuit"  disorders; epidemiologic studies reveal that the narrow racial, ethnic and income  profile of individuals no longer holds true for AN. The major organs affected long  term-the brain and skeletal system-both respond to improved nutrition, with  maintenance of body weight the best predictor of recovery. Twin studies have  revealed gene x environment interactions, including both the external (social) and  internal (pubertal) environments of boys and of girls. Family-based treatment has  the best evidence base for effectiveness for younger patients. Medication plays a  limited role in AN, but a major role in BN. Across diagnoses, the most important  medicine is food.

This category includes subependymal giant cell astrocytoma,  pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, astroblastoma, chordoid glioma of the third  ventricle, angiocentric glioma, ganglioglioma, desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma  and ganglioma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, papillary glioneuronal tumor,  and rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor of the fourth ventricle. Many of these  tumors, in particular glioneuronal tumors, prevail in children and young adults, are  characterized by pharmacoresistant seizures, and have an indolent course, and long  survival following surgical resection. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are reserved  for recurrent and/or aggressive forms. New molecular alterations are increasingly  recognized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumours of the brachial plexus region are rare and most publications are  case reports or studies with a small series of patients. The aim of this study is to  present our experience in managing these lesions. METHODS: We review 18 patients  with tumours in the brachial plexus region submitted to surgical treatment in a 6  year period, including their clinical presentation, neuro-imaging data, surgical  findings and outcome. FINDINGS: The tumours comprised a heterogeneous group of  lesions, including schwannomas, neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumour (MPNST), sarcomas, metastases, desmoids and an aneurysmal bone cyst. The most  common presentation was an expanding lump (83.33%). Eleven tumours were benign and 7  were malignant. Neurofibromatosis was present in only 2 patients (11.11%). Gross  total resection was achieved in 14 patients and sub-total resection in the others.  Only 3 patients presented with new post-operative motor deficits. The incidence of  complications was low (16.5 %). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of tumours were benign and  most of them could be excised with a low incidence of additional deficits. Some of  the malignant tumours could be controlled by surgery plus adjuvant therapy, but this  category is still associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.

AU  - Shultz, Sarah
AU  - McCarthy, Gregory
T2  - Neuropsychologia
AB  - While decades of research have demonstrated that a region of the right fusiform  gyrus (FG) responds selectively to faces, a second line of research suggests that  the FG responds to a range of animacy cues, including biological motion and  goal-directed actions, even in the absence of faces or other human-like surface  features. These findings raise the question of whether the FG is indeed sensitive to  faces or to the more abstract category of animate agents. The current study uses  fMRI to examine whether the FG responds to all faces in a category-specific way or  whether the FG is especially sensitive to the faces of animate agents. Animate  agents are defined here as intentional agents with the capacity for rational  goal-directed actions. Specifically, we examine how the FG responds to an entity  that looks like an animate agent but that lacks the capacity for goal-directed  rational action. Region-of-interest analyses reveal that the FG activates more  strongly to the animate compared with the inanimate entity, even though the surface  features of both animate and inanimate entities were identical. These results  suggest that the FG does not respond to all faces in a category-specific way, and is  instead especially sensitive to whether an entity is animate.

AU  - Shetreet, Einat

AU  - Gaab, Nadine
T2  - Human brain mapping
AB  - Making inferences beyond the literal meaning of sentences occurs with certain scalar  expressions via scalar implicatures. For example, adults usually interpret some as  some but not all. On the basis of behavioral research, it has been suggested that  processing implicatures is cognitively costly. However, many studies have used cases  where sentences with some did not match the context in which they were presented.  Our study aimed to examine whether the processing cost is linked to implicature  generation, to the mismatch between the implicature and the context, or to both  processes. To do so, we explored the neural patterns of implicature generation and  implicature mismatch using fMRI. Thirteen participants performed a sentence-picture  matching task (where pictures determined the context) with mismatched implicatures,  successful implicatures or no implicature conditions. Several brain regions were  identified when comparing cases of implicature mismatch and cases without  implicatures. One of these regions, left-IFG, was jointly activated for mismatched  and successful implicatures, as observed in a conjunction analysis. By contrast,  left-MFG and medial-frontal-gyrus, were identified when comparing cases of  implicature mismatch with cases of successful implicatures. Thus, the left IFG can  be interpreted as being linked to implicature generation, whereas the other two  areas seem to participate in the processing of the mismatch between the implicature  and its context. Our results indicate that scalar implicatures induce processing  cost in different ways. This should be considered in future research.

AB  - A region in the lateral aspect of the fusiform gyrus (FG) is more engaged by human  faces than any other category of image. It has come to be known as the 'fusiform  face area' (FFA). The origin and extent of this specialization is currently a topic  of great interest and debate. This is of special relevance to autism, because recent  studies have shown that the FFA is hypoactive to faces in this disorder. In two  linked functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of healthy young adults,  we show here that the FFA is engaged by a social attribution task (SAT) involving  perception of human-like interactions among three simple geometric shapes. The  amygdala, temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex, inferolateral frontal cortex and  superior temporal sulci were also significantly engaged. Activation of the FFA to a  task without faces challenges the received view that the FFA is restricted in its  activities to the perception of faces. We speculate that abstract semantic  information associated with faces is encoded in the FG region and retrieved for  social computations. From this perspective, the literature on hypoactivation of the  FFA in autism may be interpreted as a reflection of a core social cognitive  mechanism underlying the disorder.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Correlation of white matter microstructure with various cognitive  processing tasks and with overall intelligence has been previously demonstrated. We  investigate the correlation of white matter microstructure with various higher-order  auditory processing tasks, including interpretation of speech-in-noise, recognition  of low-pass frequency filtered words, and interpretation of time-compressed  sentences at two different values of compression. These tests are typically used to  diagnose auditory processing disorder (APD) in children. Our hypothesis is that  correlations between white matter microstructure in tracts connecting the temporal,  frontal, and parietal lobes, as well as callosal pathways, will be seen. Previous  functional imaging studies have shown correlations between activation in temporal,  frontal, and parietal regions from higher-order auditory processing tasks. In  addition, we hypothesize that the regions displaying correlations will vary  according to the task because each task uses a different set of skills. DESIGN:  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired from a cohort of 17 normal-hearing  children aged 9 to 11 yrs. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of white matter  fiber tract integrity and organization, was computed and correlated on a voxelwise  basis with performance on the auditory processing tasks, controlling for age, sex,  and full-scale IQ. RESULTS: Divergent correlations of white matter FA depending on  the particular auditory processing task were found. Positive correlations were found  between FA and speech-in-noise in white matter adjoining prefrontal areas and  between FA and filtered words in the corpus callosum. Regions exhibiting  correlations with time-compressed sentences varied depending on the degree of  compression: the greater degree of compression (with the greatest difficulty)  resulted in correlations in white matter adjoining prefrontal (dorsal and ventral),  whereas the smaller degree of compression (with less difficulty) resulted in  correlations in white matter adjoining audiovisual association areas and the  posterior cingulate. Only the time-compressed sentences with the lowest degree of  compression resulted in positive correlations in the centrum semiovale; all the  other tasks resulted in negative correlations. CONCLUSIONS: The dependence of  performance on higher-order auditory processing tasks on brain anatomical  connectivity was seen in normal-hearing children aged 9 to 11 yrs. Results support a  previously hypothesized dual-stream (dorsal and ventral) model of auditory  processing, and that higher-order processing tasks rely less on the dorsal stream  related to articulatory networks and more on the ventral stream related to semantic  comprehension. Results also show that the regions correlating with auditory  processing vary according to the specific task, indicating that the neurological  bases for the various tests used to diagnose APD in children may be partially  independent.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The structural and functional organization of brain networks subserving  basic daily activities (i.e. language, visuo-spatial cognition, movement, semantics,  etc.) are not completely understood to date. Here, we report the first probabilistic  cortical and subcortical atlas of critical structures mediating human brain  functions based on direct electrical stimulation (DES), a well-validated tool for  the exploration of cerebral processing and for performing safe surgical  interventions in eloquent areas. METHODS: We collected 1162 cortical and 659  subcortical DES responses during testing of 16 functional domains in 256 patients  undergoing awake surgery. Spatial coordinates for each functional response were  calculated, and probability distributions for the entire patient cohort were mapped  onto a standardized three-dimensional brain template using a multinomial statistical  analysis. In addition, matching analyses were performed against prior established  anatomy-based cortical and white matter (WM) atlases. RESULTS: The probabilistic  maps for each functional domain were provided. The topographical analysis  demonstrated a wide spatial distribution of cortical functional responses, while  subcortical responses were more restricted, localizing to known WM pathways. These

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and postmortem dissections  improved the knowledge of white matter (WM) anatomy, functional information is  lacking. Our aims are: to provide a subcortical atlas of human brain functions; to  elucidate the functional roles of different bundles; to provide a probabilistic  resection map of WM. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied 130 patients who underwent  awake surgery for gliomas (82 left; 48 right) with electrostimulation mapping at  cortical and subcortical levels. Different aspects of language, sensori-motor,  spatial cognition, and visual functions were monitored. 339 regions of interest  (ROIs) including the functional response errors collected during stimulation were  co-registered in the MNI space, as well as the resections' areas and residual  tumors. Functional response errors and resection areas were matched with DTI and  cortical atlases. Subcortical maps for each function and a probability map of  resection were computed. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: The medial part of dorsal stream  (arcuate fasciculus) subserves phonological processing; its lateral part [indirect  anterior portion of the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF)] subserves speech  planning. The ventral stream subserves language semantics and matches with the  inferior fronto-occipital fascicle. Reading deficits match with the inferior  longitudinal fascicle. Anomias match with the indirect posterior portion of the SLF.  Frontal WM underpins motor planning and execution. Right parietal WM subserves  spatial cognition. Sensori-motor and visual fibers were the most preserved bundles.  CONCLUSIONS: We report the first anatomo-functional atlas of WM connectivity in  humans by correlating cognitive data, electrostimulation, and DTI. We provide a  valuable tool for cognitive neurosciences and clinical applications.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is infrequent in childhood (0.3-2% of all  cases of MS). At the present time more and more paediatric patients are being  described. In this paper we describe our experience. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We review  seven patients diagnosed as having MS before the age of 16, between 1984 and 1996.  We have recorded: age, sex, personal and family history, form of onset and clinical  course. CSF, neurophysiological and neuroimaging tests, treatment and diagnostic  category according to the criteria of Poser. RESULTS: Four boys and three girls aged  between three and thirteen years at the onset of the disorder. In one case there was  a family history of MS. The most frequent form of onset was hemiparesia, followed by  oculomotor paralysis and cerebellar disorders. Six cases followed a  recurrent-remittent course and one followed a secondarily progressive course. There  were oligoclonal bands (OGB) in the CSF in three cases. Visual evoked potentials  (VEP) were abnormal in six cases. Magnetic resonance (RM) was a great help in  diagnosis and in six cases was very informative. Six patients were treated with  corticosteroids during the acute phase and two with long-term azathioprine.  CONCLUSION: The commonest form of presentation, hemiparesia, makes the differential  diagnosis with acute hemiplegia of childhood obligatory. Neurophysiological  techniques, especially the VEP are very useful for initial assessment. RM is the  most sensitive method, although it is not specific for diagnosis. The average  follow-up period (4.5 years) is too short to determine the prognosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with TLE are prone to have lower IQ scores than healthy controls.  Nevertheless, the impact of IQ differences is not usually considered in studies that  compared the cognitive functioning of children with and without epilepsy. This study  aimed to determine the effect of using IQ as a covariate on memory and  attentional/executive functions of children with TLE. METHODS: Thirty-eight children  and adolescents with TLE and 28 healthy controls paired as to age, gender, and  sociodemographic factors were evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological  battery for memory and executive functions. The authors conducted three analyses to  verify the impact of IQ scores on the other cognitive domains. First, we compared  performance on cognitive tests without controlling for IQ differences between  groups. Second, we performed the same analyses, but we included IQ as a confounding  factor. Finally, we evaluated the predictive value of IQ on cognitive functioning.  RESULTS: Although patients had IQ score in the normal range, they showed lower IQ  scores than controls (p = 0.001). When we did not consider IQ in the analyses,  patients had worse performance in verbal and visual memory (short and long-term),  semantic memory, sustained, divided and selective attention, mental flexibility and  mental tracking for semantic information. By using IQ as a covariate, patients  showed worse performance only in verbal memory (long-term), semantic memory,  sustained and divided attention and in mental flexibility. IQ was a predictor factor  of verbal and visual memory (immediate and delayed), working memory, mental  flexibility and mental tracking for semantic information. CONCLUSION: Intelligence  level had a significant impact on memory and executive functioning of children and  adolescents with TLE without intellectual disability. This finding opens the  discussion of whether IQ scores should be considered when interpreting the results  of differences in cognitive performance of patients with epilepsy compared to  healthy volunteers.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze semantic and episodic memory deficits in  children with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and their correlation with clinical  epilepsy variables. For this purpose, 19 consecutive children and adolescents with  MTS (8 to 16 years old) were evaluated and their performance on five episodic memory  tests (short- and long-term memory and learning) and four semantic memory tests was  compared with that of 28 healthy volunteers. Patients performed worse on tests of  immediate and delayed verbal episodic memory, visual episodic memory, verbal and  visual learning, mental scanning for semantic clues, object naming, word definition,  and repetition of sentences. Clinical variables such as early age at seizure onset,  severity of epilepsy, and polytherapy impaired distinct types of memory. These data  confirm that children with MTS have episodic memory deficits and add new information  on semantic memory. The data also demonstrate that clinical variables contribute  differently to episodic and semantic memory performance.

AU  - Qiu, Yinchen

T2  - Brain research
AB  - Human languages are equipped with an impressive repertoire of time-encoding devices  which vary significantly across different cultures. Previous research on temporal  processing has focused on morphosyntactic processes in Indo-European languages. This  study investigated the neural correlates of temporal processing in Mandarin Chinese,  a language that is not morphologically marked for tense. In a sentence acceptability  judgment task, we manipulated the agreement between semantically enriched temporal  adverbs or a highly grammaticalized aspectual particle (-guo) and temporal noun  phrases. Disagreement of both the temporal adverbs and the aspectual particle  elicited a centro-parietal P600 effect in event-related potentials (ERPs) whereas  only disagreeing temporal adverbs evoked an additional broadly distributed N400  effect. Moreover, a sustained negativity effect was observed on both the words  following the critical ones and the last words in sentences with temporal  disagreement. These results reveal both commonalities and differences between  Chinese and Indo-European languages in temporal agreement processing. In particular,  we demonstrate that temporal reference in Chinese relies on both lexical semantics  and morphosyntactic processes and that the level of grammaticalization of linguistic  devices representing similar temporal information is reflected in differential ERP  responses.

AB  - Among the most prevailing assumptions in science and society about the human reading  process is that sound and sound-based phonology are critical to young readers. The  child's sound-to-letter decoding is viewed as universal and vital to deriving  meaning from print. We offer a different view. The crucial link for early reading  success is not between segmental sounds and print. Instead the human brain's  capacity to segment, categorize, and discern linguistic patterning makes possible  the capacity to segment all languages. This biological process includes the  segmentation of languages on the hands in signed languages. Exposure to natural sign  language in early life equally affords the child's discovery of silent segmental  units in visual sign phonology (VSP) that can also facilitate segmental decoding of  print. We consider powerful biological evidence about the brain, how it builds sound  and sign phonology, and why sound and sign phonology are equally important in  language learning and reading. We offer a testable theoretical account, reading  model, and predictions about how VSP can facilitate segmentation and mapping between  print and meaning. We explain how VSP can be a powerful facilitator of all  children's reading success (deaf and hearing)-an account with profound  transformative impact on learning to read in deaf children with different language  backgrounds. The existence of VSP has important implications for understanding core  properties of all human language and reading, challenges assumptions about language  and reading as being tied to sound, and provides novel insight into a remarkable  biological equivalence in signed and spoken languages.

AB  - This chapter presents a summary of current notions regarding cortical specialization  for language and a description of the methods employed for the assessment of that  specialization. We distinguish between the "canonical" model of language  specialization as it evolved from the early observations of Broca and Wernicke,  implicating the inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior temporal cortex of the  speech dominant hemisphere (usually the left) and its modern variants that are based  on both detailed studies of lesion-symptom correlations and on the results of  functional brain mapping methods. The latter fall into two categories. The first  includes the invasive ones, namely the Wada procedure for assessing hemispheric  dominance for speech and cortical stimulation mapping (whether intraoperative or  extraoperative) for identifying cortical nodes or "hubs" of the neuronal network for  language. The second category includes the noninvasive methods of functional  magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, and transcranial magnetic  stimulation used for both assessment of hemispheric dominance for language and for  localization of the cortical nodes of the language network. The advantages and the  shortcomings of all methods are juxtaposed to facilitate selection of particular  methods of assessment of the locus of the language network in particular cases.

AB  - We present neuropsychological and functional outcome data in a teenager undergoing  stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy (SLAH) who had drug-resistant mesial  temporal lobe epilepsy due to left hippocampal sclerosis. Given strong baseline  cognitive performance, there was concern for post-operative declines in language and  verbal memory were this patient to undergo open resection. She was evaluated pre-  and post-ablation with clinical and experimental neuropsychological measures  including semantic memory, category-specific object/face recognition and naming,  spatial learning, and socio-emotional processing. The patient became seizure-free  following SLAH and experienced significant improvements in school performance and  social engagement. She experienced improvement in recognition and naming of multiple  object categories, memory functions, and verbal fluency. In contrast, the patient  declined significantly in her ability to recognize emotional tone from facial  expressions, a socio-emotional process that had been normal prior to surgery. We  believe this decline was related to surgical disruption of the limbic system, an  area highly involved in emotional processing, and suspect such deficits are an  under-assessed and unrecognized risk for all surgeries involving the  amygdalohippocampal complex and broader limbic system regions. We hope this positive  SLAH outcome will serve as impetus for group level research to establish its safety  and efficacy in the pediatric setting.

TI  - Dyslexia: a neuroscientific puzzle.
AU  - Njiokiktjien, C.
T2  - Acta paedopsychiatrica
AB  - The initial assumptions as to the existence of neurodevelopmental disorders have  been confirmed by almost a century of studies focused on the nature and causes of  reading disability. Dyslexia is an umbrella term for the various manifestations of  reading disabilities, each of which is related to its own complex of  neuropsychological dysfunctions, sometimes accompanied by neurological symptoms that  can be indicative of the specific location involved. Electro-physiology and  neuro-imaging in relation to metabolic activity have also confirmed that, to some  extent, there is dysfunction in various cerebral areas, more frequently in the left  than in the right hemisphere, less often between the hemispheres (corpus callosum)  and outside the classical language areas. The rather rare subtype referred to as  visual dyslexia and the inter-modal disconnection type resembling alexia are  eclipsed by dyslexias related to spoken language: the dysphonemic  (auditory-phonological) subtype and the subtypes that are concerned with the  production of speech (fluency, word-finding, syntax, sequences), semantics (language  comprehension) and linguistic memory. Although it is considered that there are basic  brain dysfunctions in dyslexics such as deficits in sequential information  processing, there is no "grand unified theory" of dyslexia. There are some new  insights as regards the aetiology. In addition to indications of such possible  causes as perinatal brain damage, genetic or chromosomal anomalies that manifest  themselves in the substrate in an unclear manner, there is also the possibility that  the cortical language areas can be disturbed in their development (migration  disorders and abnormal asymmetry) due to genetic or epigenetic hormonal and/or  immunological factors, so that the normal left hemispheric dominance does not  develop. The diagnosis and treatment of dyslexia should begin at an early age and  should be acknowledged as being of great social importance.

AB  - Extragonadal germ cell tumors are a rare entity that is more prevalent in infants  and young children, with preference to midline structures. The category of  intracranial germ cell tumors is divided into pure germ cell tumors (GCTs) versus  nongerminomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). They are usually present in the second  decade of life with a male preponderance. We present here a rare case of  intracranial NGGCT in a 21-year-old Romanian male, who presented with complaints of  emesis, ataxic gait, and diplopia. A computed tomography scan of the head in the  emergency department revealed a pineal/suprapineal mass along with obstructive  hydrocephalus and dilated lateral and third ventricles without any bleeding. MRI of  the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine showed no evidence of leptomeningeal  metastasis. The patient had elevated serum markers of beta-hCG and AFP, which  pointed towards a diagnosis of nongerm cell tumor, as in pure GCTs, these markers  are normal. To relieve the obstruction from the mass effect, the patient had an  endoscopic third ventriculostomy (EVT). However, after the procedure, he developed  central diabetes insipidus as a complication with a triphasic response. Biopsy of  the mass revealed atypical cells with granular architecture and atypical glands with  positive immune histological markers for NGGCT. These findings supported the  diagnosis of mixed germ cell tumor with yolk sac carcinoma and seminoma components.  Patient's transient central diabetes resolved with normalization in his urine  output. He was eventually stabilized and returned to Romania for further management.  In summary, intracranial germ cell tumors are rare brain tumors that should be  distinguished based on histology and tumor markers as they will help in the guidance  of therapy. An initial evaluation with neuroimaging, tumor markers, cytology from  CSF, and biopsy is a must to distinguish further treatment and prognosis.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), in which the degenerative process also affect  the retina, belongs to the category of the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type  II (ADCA II). We have described the neuropathology of this condition [Martin JJ, Van  Regemorter N, Krols L, Brucher JM, de Barsy T, Szliwowski H, et al. On an autosomal  dominant form of retino-cerebellar degeneration: an autopsy study of five patients  in one family. Acta Neuropathol (Berl) 1994;88:277-286] in a very large Belgian  family (CA-1). We have observed anticipation in the age of onset with increasing  severity of the symptoms in consecutive generations. The SCA7 gene was mapped to  chromosome 3p12-13 [David G, Abbas N, Stevanin G, Dürr A, Yvert G, Cancel G, et al.  Cloning of the SCA7 gene reveals a highly unstable CAG repeat expansion. Nat Genet  1997;17:65-70; Del-Favero J, Krols L, Michalik A, Theuns J, Löfgren A, Goossens D,  et al. Molecular genetic analysis of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with  retinal degeneration (ADCA type II) caused by CAG triplet repeat expansion. Hum Mol  Genet 1998;7:177-186], and the gene identified. SCA7 is a new gene of unknown  function that contains an expansion of CAG repeats in SCA7 patients. During the  procedure of positional cloning, we examined 26 patients belonging to the CA-1  family and realized, in some of them, an ophthalmologic examination and  neuro-imaging of the brain. This allowed us to differentiate four groups: (1)  asymptomatic young carriers with 38 to 43 CAG repeats; (2) mildly symptomatic, older  patients with 38-41 CAG repeats; (3) patients with the full-blown picture of SCA7  and age of onset during adolescence, with 54-55 CAG repeats; (4) children with early  onset and rapid fatal course of the disease who had over 55 CAG repeats. We were  able to draw correlations between clinical phenotype, age at onset and CAG repeat  number and to make predictions, to some extent, as to the clinical course of the  disease in new patients.

AB  - Neuroimaging studies have reported structural and physiological differences that  could help understand the causes and development of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  Many of them rely on multisite designs, with the recruitment of larger samples  increasing statistical power. However, recent large-scale studies have put some  findings into question, considering the results to be strongly dependent on the  database used, and demonstrating the substantial heterogeneity within this  clinically defined category. One major source of variance may be the acquisition of  the data in multiple centres. In this work we analysed the differences found in the  multisite, multi-modal neuroimaging database from the UK Medical Research Council  Autism Imaging Multicentre Study (MRC AIMS) in terms of both diagnosis and  acquisition sites. Since the dissimilarities between sites were higher than between  diagnostic groups, we developed a technique called Significance Weighted Principal  Component Analysis (SWPCA) to reduce the undesired intensity variance due to  acquisition site and to increase the statistical power in detecting group  differences. After eliminating site-related variance, statistically significant  group differences were found, including Broca's area and the temporo-parietal  junction. However, discriminative power was not sufficient to classify diagnostic  groups, yielding accuracies results close to random. Our work supports recent claims  that ASD is a highly heterogeneous condition that is difficult to globally  characterize by neuroimaging, and therefore different (and more homogenous)  subgroups should be defined to obtain a deeper understanding of ASD.

AB  - In all signed languages used by deaf people, signs are executed in "sign space" in  front of the body. Some signed sentences use this space to map detailed "real-world"  spatial relationships directly. Such sentences can be considered to exploit sign  space "topographically." Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored  the extent to which increasing the topographic processing demands of signed  sentences was reflected in the differential recruitment of brain regions in deaf and  hearing native signers of the British Sign Language. When BSL signers performed a  sentence anomaly judgement task, the occipito-temporal junction was activated  bilaterally to a greater extent for topographic than nontopographic processing. The  differential role of movement in the processing of the two sentence types may  account for this finding. In addition, enhanced activation was observed in the left  inferior and superior parietal lobules during processing of topographic BSL  sentences. We argue that the left parietal lobe is specifically involved in  processing the precise configuration and location of hands in space to represent  objects, agents, and actions. Importantly, no differences in these regions were  observed when hearing people heard and saw English translations of these sentences.  Despite the high degree of similarity in the neural systems underlying signed and  spoken languages, exploring the linguistic features which are unique to each of  these broadens our understanding of the systems involved in language comprehension.

AB  - Stimulus exposure duration in emotion perception research is often chosen  pragmatically; however, little work exists on the consequences of stimulus duration  for the processing of emotional faces. We utilized the spatiotemporal resolution  capabilities of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterize early implicit  processing of emotional and neutral faces in response to stimuli presented for 80  and 150ms. We found that the insula was recruited to a greater degree within the  short (80ms) condition for all face categories, and this effect was more pronounced  for emotional compared to neutral faces. The orbitofrontal cortex was more active in  the 80-ms condition for neutral faces only, suggesting a modulation of task  difficulty by both the duration and the emotional category of the stimuli. No  effects on reaction time or accuracy were observed. Our findings caution that  differences in stimulus duration may result in differential neural processing of  emotional faces and challenge the idea that neutral faces constitute a neutral  baseline.

AB  - Productive vocabulary composition is investigated in 17-month-old children who are  participating in an ongoing longitudinal dyslexia research project in the  Netherlands. The project is searching for early precursors for dyslexia and follows  a group of children who are genetically at risk for dyslexia and a control group  during the first 10 years of their lives. Among other measures, the Dutch version of  the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory: Words and Sentences (N-CDI) is  used to investigate early vocabulary development. In this article, the first N-CDI  results from the 2 groups of 17-month-old children are compared with each other,  with other cross-sectional, cross-linguistic studies, and with a similar Finnish  longitudinal dyslexia project. The Dutch children show the same general acquisition  pattern as documented for other languages, but there are significant differences  between the two groups of 17-month-old children in total number of words produced  and in the linguistic composition of their productive vocabulary.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with working- and  autobiographical-memory impairments, and high rates of mood disorder. This study  aimed to examine (i) behavioral responses and (ii) neural activation patterns  elicited by autobiographical and working memory tasks in moderate-severe untreated  OSA patients and healthy controls, and (iii) whether variability in autobiographical  and working memory activation are associated with task performance, OSA severity and  psychological symptomatology (depression, anxiety). In order to control for the  potential confounding effect of elevated rates of clinical depression in OSA, we  excluded individuals with a current psychiatric condition. Seventeen untreated OSA  participants and 16 healthy controls were comparable with regards to both activation  and behavioral performance. OSA was associated with worse subclinical mood symptoms  and poorer personal semantic memory. Higher levels of nocturnal hypoxia were  associated with increased activation in the occipital cortex and right cerebellum  during the working memory task in OSA participants, however, no significant  relationships between activation and task performance or depressive/anxiety  symptomatology were observed. The neurocognitive substrates supporting  autobiographical recall of recent events and working memory in younger, recently  diagnosed individuals with OSA appear to be indistinguishable from healthy  age-matched individuals. These findings point to the importance of early diagnosis  and treatment of OSA in order to preserve cognitive function.

AB  - Ensemble representations are often described as efficient tools when summarizing  features of multiple similar objects as a group. However, it can sometimes be more  useful not to compute a single summary description for all of the objects if they  are substantially different, for example when they belong to entirely different  categories. It was proposed that the visual system can efficiently use the  distributional information of ensembles to decide whether simultaneously displayed  items belong to single or several different categories. Here we directly tested how  the feature distribution of items in a visual array affects an ability to  discriminate individual items (Experiment 1) and sets (Experiments 2-3) when  participants were instructed explicitly to categorize individual objects based on  the median of size distribution. We varied the width (narrow or fat) as well as the  shape (smooth or two-peaked) of distributions in order to manipulate the ease of  ensemble extraction from the items. We found that observers unintentionally relied  on the grand mean as a natural categorical boundary and that their categorization  accuracy increased as a function of the size differences among individual items and  a function of their separation from the grand mean. For ensembles drawn from  two-peaked size distributions, participants showed better categorization  performance. They were more accurate at judging within-category ensemble properties  in other dimensions (centroid and orientation) and less biased by superset  statistics. This finding corroborates the idea that the two-peaked feature  distributions support the "segmentability" of spatially intermixed sets of objects.  Our results emphasize important roles of ensemble statistics (mean, range,  distribution shape) in explicit visual categorization.

AB  - This study concerns the relationship between a cognitive style dimension, category  width, and hemispheric differentiation. When lists of word pairs were presented  simultaneously in a dichotic listening task to broad and narrow categorisers (all  female, right-handed), both groups of subjects recalled more words presented to the  right ear than those presented to the left ear; indicating left hemisphere's  superiority in verbal processing. Both broad and narrow categorisers recalled a  similar number of words in the right ear (left hemisphere), but the former recalled  significantly more words in the left ear than did the latter. This finding is  interpreted as meaning that narrow categorisers rely predominantly on the left  hemisphere in verbal processing, and that in comparison with narrow categories,  there is greater right hemispheric involvement in processing in the case of broad  categorisers. The implication of this finding in terms of the differential  processing strategies adopted by the two groups of individuals is discussed.

AB  - Current theories of language recovery after stroke are limited by a reliance on  small studies. Here, we aimed to test predictions of current theory and resolve  inconsistencies regarding right hemispheric contributions to long-term recovery. We  first defined the canonical semantic network in 43 healthy controls. Then, in a  group of 43 patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia, we tested whether activity in  this network predicted performance on measures of semantic comprehension, naming,  and fluency while controlling for lesion volume effects. Canonical network  activation accounted for 22%-33% of the variance in language test scores.  Whole-brain analyses corroborated these findings, and revealed a core set of regions  showing positive relationships to all language measures. We next evaluated the  relationship between activation magnitudes in left and right hemispheric portions of  the network, and characterized how right hemispheric activation related to the  extent of left hemispheric damage. Activation magnitudes in each hemispheric network  were strongly correlated, but four right frontal regions showed heightened activity  in patients with large lesions. Activity in two of these regions (inferior frontal  gyrus pars opercularis and supplementary motor area) was associated with better  language abilities in patients with larger lesions, but poorer language abilities in  patients with smaller lesions. Our results indicate that bilateral language networks  support language processing after stroke, and that right hemispheric activations  related to extensive left hemispheric damage occur outside of the canonical semantic  network and differentially relate to behavior depending on the extent of left  hemispheric damage.

AB  - Although neural activity often reflects the processing of external inputs, intrinsic  fluctuations in activity have been observed throughout the brain. These may relate  to patterns of self-generated thought that can occur while not performing  goal-driven tasks. To understand the relationship between self-generated mental  activity and intrinsic neural fluctuations, we developed the New York Cognition  Questionnaire (NYC-Q) to assess the content and form of an individual's experiences  during the acquisition of resting-state fMRI data. The data were collected as a part  of the Nathan Kline Rockland Enhanced sample. We decomposed NYC-Q scores using  exploratory factor analysis and found that self-reported thoughts clustered into  distinct dimensions of content (future related, past related, positive, negative,  and social) and form (words, images, and specificity). We used these components to  perform an individual difference analysis exploring how differences in the types of  self-generated thoughts relate to whole brain measures of intrinsic brain activity  (fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and  degree centrality). We found patterns of self-generated thoughts related to changes  that were distributed across a wide range of cortical areas. For example,  individuals who reported greater imagery exhibited greater low frequency  fluctuations in a region of perigenual cingulate cortex, a region that is known to  participate in the so-called default-mode network. We also found certain forms of  thought were associated with other areas, such as primary visual cortex, the insula,  and the cerebellum. For example, individuals who reported greater future thought  exhibited less homogeneous neural fluctuations in a region of lateral occipital  cortex, a result that is consistent with the claim that particular types of  self-generated thought depend on processes that are decoupled from sensory  processes. These data provide evidence that self-generated thought is a  heterogeneous category of experience and that studying its content can be helpful in  understanding brain dynamics.

AB  - Recently there has been a renewed interest in cognitive psychology on the effects of  the age of word acquisition (AoA) on lexical processing. In particular, it is  currently unclear whether AoA or word frequency are better predictors of word  recognition. To date no study has investigated the neural bases of the AoA effect or  attempted to dissociate it from word frequency. We report a visual and an auditory  event-related fMRI experiment investigating the influence of AoA and word frequency  on neural activity, and show that AoA modulates brain areas that are not influenced  by word frequency. The precuneus was activated for early learned words across  auditory and visual presentation modalities. Additional activity in the auditory  cortex was observed specifically for the reading of early acquired words. Late  learned words, in contrast, led to a selective activation increase in lateral  inferior frontal areas. These findings support models that suggest that early and  late learned words are represented differently in the brain. They further allow to  specify the nature of the representational differences, namely that early learned  words are represented in the brain in a more sensory manner than late learned words.

AB  - Dementia represents one of the most diffuse disorders of our Era. Alzheimer's  disease is the principle cause of dementia worldwide. Metabolic, infectious,  autoimmune, inflammatory, and genetic dementias represent a not negligible number of  disorders, with increasing numbers in younger subjects. Due to the heterogeneity of  patients and disorders, the diagnosis of dementia is challenging. In the present  article, we propose a practical diagnostic approach following the two-step  investigation procedure. The first step includes basic blood tests and brain  neuroimaging, performed on all patients. After this first-line investigation, it is  then possible to rule out metabolic causes of dementia and to identify three main  subgroups in dementia: predominant gray matter atrophy, white matter disease, basal  ganglia pathologies. The predominant gray matter atrophy subgroup includes  neurodegenerative causes of dementia and some lysosomal storage disorders. The white  matter subgroup indicates a comprehensive list of vascular dementia causes,  mitochondrial diseases, and leukodystrophies. Whereas, the basal ganglia alterations  are due to metal accumulation pathologies, such as iron, copper, or calcium. Each  category has specific clinical hallmarks, accurately reported in the article, and  requires specific second-line investigation. Thus, we indicate the distinct second  diagnostic step of each disease. The proposed diagnostic flow-chart follows the  clinical reasoning and helps clinicians through the differential diagnosis of  dementia.

AU  - Engle, Elizabeth C.
T2  - Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology
AB  - This article reviews symptoms and signs of aberrant axon connectivity in humans, and  summarizes major human genetic disorders that result, or have been proposed to  result, from defective axon guidance. These include corpus callosum agenesis, L1  syndrome, Joubert syndrome and related disorders, horizontal gaze palsy with  progressive scoliosis, Kallmann syndrome, albinism, congenital fibrosis of the  extraocular muscles type 1, Duane retraction syndrome, and pontine tegmental cap  dysplasia. Genes mutated in these disorders can encode axon growth cone ligands and  receptors, downstream signaling molecules, and axon transport motors, as well as  proteins without currently recognized roles in axon guidance. Advances in  neuroimaging and genetic techniques have the potential to rapidly expand this field,  and it is feasible that axon guidance disorders will soon be recognized as a new and  significant category of human neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Prosopagnosia is a selective visual agnosia characterized by the inability to  recognize the identity of faces. There are both acquired forms secondary to brain  damage and developmental forms without obvious structural lesions. In this review,  we first discuss the diagnosis of acquired and developmental prosopagnosia, and the  challenges present in the latter case. Second, we discuss the evidence regarding the  selectivity of the prosopagnosic defect, particularly in relation to the recognition  of other objects, written words (another visual object category requiring high  expertise), and voices. Third, we summarize recent findings about the structural and  functional basis of prosopagnosia from studies using magnetic resonance imaging,  functional magnetic resonance imaging, and event-related potentials. Finally, we  discuss recent attempts at rehabilitation of face recognition in prosopagnosia.

AB  - OBJECT: Functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging of the motor cortex is a  potentially powerful tool in the preoperative planning of surgical procedures in and  around the rolandic region. Little is known about the patterns of fMR imaging  activation associated with various pathological lesions in that region or their  relation to motor skills before surgical intervention. METHODS: Twenty-two control  volunteers and 44 patients whose pathologies included arteriovenous malformations  (AVMs; 16 patients), congenital cortical abnormalities (11 patients), and tumors (17  patients) were studied using fMR imaging and a hand motor task paradigm. Activation  maps were constructed for each participant, and changes in position or amplitude of  the motor activation on the lesion side were compared with the activation pattern  obtained in the contralateral hemisphere. A classification scheme of plasticity  (Grades 1-6) based on interhemispheric pixel asymmetry and displacement of  activation was used to compare maps between patients, and relative to hand motor  dexterity and/or weakness. There was 89.4% interobserver agreement on classification  of patterns of fMR imaging activation. Displacement of activation by mass effect was  more likely with tumors. Cortical malformations offer a much higher functional  reorganization than AVMs or tumors. High-grade plasticity is recruited to compensate  for severe motor impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Pattern modification of fMR imaging  activation can be systematized in a classification of motor cortex plasticity. This  classification has shown good correlation among grading, brain lesions, and motor  skills. This proposal of a classification scheme, in addition to facilitating data  collection and processing from different institutions, is well suited for comparing  risks associated with surgical intervention and patterns of functional recovery in  relation to preoperative fMR imaging categorization. Such studies are underway at  the authors' institution.

AB  - We present a new method to identify anatomical subnetworks of the human connectome  that are optimally predictive of targeted clinical variables, developmental outcomes  or disease states. Given a training set of structural or functional brain networks,  derived from diffusion MRI (dMRI) or functional MRI (fMRI) scans respectively, our  sparse linear regression model extracts a weighted subnetwork. By enforcing novel  backbone network and connectivity based priors along with a non-negativity  constraint, the discovered subnetworks are simultaneously anatomically plausible,  well connected, positively weighted and reasonably sparse. We apply our method to  (1) predicting the cognitive and neuromotor developmental outcomes of a dataset of  168 structural connectomes of preterm neonates, and (2) predicting the autism  spectrum category of a dataset of 1013 resting-state functional connectomes from the  Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database. We find that the addition of  each of our novel priors improves prediction accuracy and together outperform other  state-of-the-art prediction techniques. We then examine the structure of the learned  subnetworks in terms of topological features and with respect to established  function and physiology of different regions of the brain.

T2  - Proceedings. Biological sciences
AB  - We report a study of eight members of a single family (aged 8-72 years), who all  show a specific deficit in linking semantic knowledge to language. All affected  members of the family had high levels of overall intelligence; however, they had  profound difficulties in prose and sentence recall, listening comprehension and  naming. The behavioural deficit was remarkably consistent across affected family  members. Structural neuroimaging data revealed grey matter abnormalities in the left  infero-temporal cortex and fusiform gyri: brain areas that have been associated with  integrative semantics. This family demonstrates, to our knowledge, the first example  of a heritable, highly specific abnormality affecting the interface between language  and cognition in humans and has important implications for our understanding of the  genetic basis of cognition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gambling and gaming disorders have been included as "disorders due to  addictive behaviors" in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Other  problematic behaviors may be considered as "other specified disorders due to  addictive behaviors (6C5Y)." METHODS: Narrative review, experts' opinions. RESULTS:  We suggest the following meta-level criteria for considering potential addictive  behaviors as fulfilling the category of "other specified disorders due to addictive  behaviors":1. Clinical relevance: Empirical evidence from multiple scientific  studies demonstrates that the specific potential addictive behavior is clinically  relevant and individuals experience negative consequences and functional impairments  in daily life due to the problematic and potentially addictive behavior.2.  Theoretical embedding: Current theories and theoretical models belonging to the  field of research on addictive behaviors describe and explain most appropriately the  candidate phenomenon of a potential addictive behavior.3. Empirical evidence: Data  based on self-reports, clinical interviews, surveys, behavioral experiments, and, if  available, biological investigations (neural, physiological, genetic) suggest that  psychological (and neurobiological) mechanisms involved in other addictive behaviors  are also valid for the candidate phenomenon. Varying degrees of support for  problematic forms of pornography use, buying and shopping, and use of social  networks are available. These conditions may fit the category of "other specified  disorders due to addictive behaviors". CONCLUSION: It is important not to  over-pathologize everyday-life behavior while concurrently not trivializing  conditions that are of clinical importance and that deserve public health  considerations. The proposed meta-level-criteria may help guide both research  efforts and clinical practice.

AB  - Recent advances in multi-atlas based algorithms address many of the previous  limitations in model-based and probabilistic segmentation methods. However, at the  label fusion stage, a majority of algorithms focus primarily on optimizing  weight-maps associated with the atlas library based on a theoretical objective  function that approximates the segmentation error. In contrast, we propose a novel  method-Autocorrecting Walks over Localized Markov Random Fields (AWoL-MRF)-that aims  at mimicking the sequential process of manual segmentation, which is the  gold-standard for virtually all the segmentation methods. AWoL-MRF begins with a set  of candidate labels generated by a multi-atlas segmentation pipeline as an initial  label distribution and refines low confidence regions based on a localized Markov  random field (L-MRF) model using a novel sequential inference process (walks). We  show that AWoL-MRF produces state-of-the-art results with superior accuracy and  robustness with a small atlas library compared to existing methods. We validate the  proposed approach by performing hippocampal segmentations on three independent  datasets: (1) Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Database (ADNI); (2) First Episode  Psychosis patient cohort; and (3) A cohort of preterm neonates scanned early in life  and at term-equivalent age. We assess the improvement in the performance  qualitatively as well as quantitatively by comparing AWoL-MRF with majority vote,  STAPLE, and Joint Label Fusion methods. AWoL-MRF reaches a maximum accuracy of 0.881  (dataset 1), 0.897 (dataset 2), and 0.807 (dataset 3) based on Dice similarity  coefficient metric, offering significant performance improvements with a smaller  atlas library (< 10) over compared methods. We also evaluate the diagnostic utility  of AWoL-MRF by analyzing the volume differences per disease category in the ADNI1:  Complete Screening dataset. We have made the source code for AWoL-MRF public at:  https://github.com/CobraLab/AWoL-MRF.

AB  - Despite intact decoding ability, deficits in reading comprehension are relatively  common in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, few neuroimaging  studies have tested the neural bases of this specific profile of reading deficit in  ASD. This fMRI study examined activation and synchronization of the brain's reading  network in children with ASD with specific reading comprehension deficits during a  word similarities task. Thirteen typically developing children and 18 children with  ASD performed the task in the MRI scanner. No statistically significant group  differences in functional activation were observed; however, children with ASD  showed decreased functional connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus  (LIFG) and the left inferior occipital gyrus (LIOG). In addition, reading  comprehension ability significantly positively predicted functional connectivity  between the LIFG and left thalamus (LTHAL) among all subjects. The results of this  study provide evidence for altered recruitment of reading-related neural resources  in ASD children and suggest specific weaknesses in top-down modulation of semantic  processing.

AB  - A card sorting paradigm was used to observe the neural correlates of feedback  processing in adult participants. Visually presented feedback was used to indicate  response accuracy and the requirement to shift response set in a 2-category card  sorting task. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses to feedback cues were analysed  using a beamformer-based spatial filtering algorithm (event-related Synthetic  Aperture Magnetometry, erSAM). Analysis of source power revealed activity in rostral  anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) only to negative feedback processing, which peaked  at 260 ms after stimulus onset. The results are in agreement with both evidence from  fMRI on spatial characteristics of negative feedback processing, and evidence from  event-related potentials (ERPs) on the temporal profile of this ACC response. The  superior temporal gyrus was activated only with positive feedback, reflecting  integration of actions with successful outcomes. The present MEG erSAM findings are  the first to provide both accurate spatial localization as well as temporal  specificity for the neural correlates of feedback processing.

AB  - Face perception abilities in humans exhibit a marked expertise in distinguishing  individual human faces at the expense of individual faces from other species (the  other-species effect). In particular, one behavioural effect of such specialization  is that human adults search for and find categories of non-human faces faster and  more accurately than a specific non-human face, and vice versa for human faces.  However, a recent visual search study showed that neural responses (event-related  potentials, ERPs) were identical when finding either a non-human or human face. We  used time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis of the EEG data from that study to  investigate the dynamics of neural representations during a visual search for  own-species (human) or other-species (non-human ape) faces, with greater sensitivity  than traditional ERP analyses. The location of each target (i.e., right or left)  could be decoded from the EEG, with similar accuracy for human and non-human faces.  However, the neural patterns associated with searching for an exemplar versus a  category target differed for human faces compared to non-human faces: Exemplar  representations could be more reliably distinguished from category representations  for human than non-human faces. These findings suggest that the other-species effect  modulates the nature of representations, but preserves the attentional selection of  target items based on these representations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal stimulation theory and moderate brain arousal (MBA) model  hypothesize that extra-task stimulation (e.g. white noise) could improve cognitive  functions of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We  investigate benefits of white noise on attention and inhibition in children with and  without ADHD (7-12 years old), both at behavioral and at neurophysiological levels.  METHODS: Thirty children with and without ADHD performed a visual cued Go/Nogo task  in two conditions (white noise or no-noise exposure), in which behavioral and P300  (mean amplitudes) data were analyzed. Spontaneous eye-blink rates were also recorded  and participants went through neuropsychological assessment. Two separate analyses  were conducted with each child separately assigned into two groups (1) ADHD or  typically developing children (TDC), and (2) noise beneficiaries or  non-beneficiaries according to the observed performance during the experiment. This  latest categorization, based on a new index we called "Noise Benefits Index" (NBI),  was proposed to determine a neuropsychological profile positively sensitive to  noise. RESULTS: Noise exposure reduced omission rate in children with ADHD, who were  no longer different from TDC. Eye-blink rate was higher in children with ADHD but  was not modulated by white noise. NBI indicated a significant relationship between  ADHD and noise benefit. Strong correlations were observed between noise benefit and  neuropsychological weaknesses in vigilance and inhibition. Participants who  benefited from noise had an increased Go P300 in the noise condition. CONCLUSION:  The improvement of children with ADHD with white noise supports both optimal  stimulation theory and MBA model. However, eye-blink rate results question the  dopaminergic hypothesis in the latter. The NBI evidenced a profile positively  sensitive to noise, related with ADHD, and associated with weaker cognitive control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the functions of different brain areas has represented a  major endeavor of neurosciences. Historically, brain functions have been associated  with specific cortical brain areas; however, modern neuroimaging developments  suggest cognitive functions are associated to networks rather than to areas.  OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper was to analyze the connectivity of Brodmann  area (BA) 37 (posterior, inferior, and temporal/fusiform gyrus) in relation to (1)  language and (2) visual processing. METHODS: Two meta-analyses were initially  conducted (first level analysis). The first one was intended to assess the language  network in which BA37 is involved. The second one was intended to assess the visual  perception network. A third meta-analysis (second level analysis) was then performed  to assess contrasts and convergence between the two cognitive domains (language and  visual perception). The DataBase of Brainmap was used. RESULTS: Our results support  the role of BA37 in language but by means of a distinct network from the network  that supports its second most important function: visual perception. CONCLUSION: It  was concluded that left BA37 is a common node of two distinct networks-visual  recognition (perception) and semantic language functions.

AB  - Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a category of severe, disabling epilepsy,  characterized by frequent, treatment-resistant seizures, and cognitive impairment.  Electroencephalography (EEG) shows characteristic generalized epileptic activity  that is similar in those with lesional, genetic, or unknown causes, suggesting a  common underlying mechanism. The condition typically begins in young children,  leaving many severely disabled with recurring seizures throughout their adult life.  Scalp EEG of the tonic seizures of LGS is characterized by a diffuse high-voltage  slow transient evolving into generalized low-voltage fast activity, likely  reflecting sustained fast neuronal firing over a wide cortical area. The typical  interictal discharges (runs of slow spike-and-wave and bursts of generalized  paroxysmal fast activity) also have a "generalized" electrical field, suggesting  widespread cortical involvement. Recent brain mapping studies have begun to reveal  which cortical and subcortical regions are active during these "generalized"  discharges. In this critical review, we examine findings from neuroimaging studies  of LGS and place these in the context of the electrical and clinical features of the  syndrome. We suggest that LGS can be conceptualized as "secondary network epilepsy,"  where the epileptic activity is expressed through large-scale brain networks,  particularly the attention and default-mode networks. Cortical lesions, when  present, appear to chronically interact with these networks to produce network  instability rather than triggering each individual epileptic discharge. LGS can be  considered as "secondary" network epilepsy because the epileptic manifestations of  the disorder reflect the networks being driven, rather than the specific initiating  process. In this review, we begin with a summation of the clinical manifestations of  LGS and what this has revealed about the underlying etiology of the condition. We  then undertake a systematic review of the functional neuroimaging literature in LGS,  which leads us to conclude that LGS can best be conceptualized as "secondary network  epilepsy."
