AB  - Background: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a neurogenetic syndrome associated with a high rate of psychiatric disorders. Previous research has revealed distinctive cognitive deficits, including impaired face processing. However, the neuro-functional substrates underlying these deficits have not been explored. Our aim was to investigate facial and emotional processing in 22q11DS. Methods: During event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, 15 individuals with 22q11DS were compared with age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects on a simple visual categorization task (faces or houses). Each stimulus was presented twice, and faces had either neutral or emotional (fearful) expressions. Results: Abnormal responses to faces were observed in 22q11DS, including a lack of normal face-selectivity in fusiform gyrus. By contrast, responses to houses were comparable across groups, with preserved selectivity in parahippocampal gyrus. Results also revealed a repetition-suppression effect for fearful faces in the right amygdala, which arose in healthy control subjects only, suggesting a lack of amygdala modulation by fear expression in 22q11DS. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate selective anomalies in several brain regions critically implicated in visual and social function in 22q11DS. These findings suggest important new avenues for studying emotional processing and social deficits frequently observed in psychotic patients and establishing their relation to specific phenotypic manifestations in 22q11DS. © 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

TI  - A lifespan perspective on semantic processing of concrete concepts: Does a sensory/motor model have the potential to bridge the gap?
AU  - Antonucci, S.M.

T2  - Cognitive, Affective and Behavioral Neuroscience
AB  - Research regarding semantic knowledge of objects is often conducted independently in children and adults. Review of these bodies of evidence suggests that the two literatures are often complementary. It seems critical to determine what we can learn from a developmental perspective, toward the common goal of understanding semantic organization. Here we focus on the proposal that semantic knowledge about concrete concepts may be built on the foundation of sensory/motor processes. In particular, we focus on a moderate formulation of this viewpoint, the sensory/motor model of semantic representations of objects (e.g., Gainotti 2007; Martin 2007), which has been examined utilizing behavioral, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological evidence. Taken together, behavioral and neuroimaging studies with infants, older children, and adults have suggested that patterns laid down in early childhood remain salient throughout the lifespan and may also predict patterns of deficit that emerge following brain injury. © Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2011.

AB  - Brain activation differences of reading-related processes between dyslexic and normal reading children were localized with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The children performed tasks that varied in visuospatial, orthographic, phonologic, and semantic processing demands. Enhanced activation of the left extrastriate cortex was found during all tasks in the dyslexic group. During orthographic processing, dyslexic children predominantly showed activation in the right prefrontal cortex, as also occurred during the visuo-spatial task. Normal readers also showed activation in the left prefrontal cortex. Dyslexic readers showed less activation of both the temporal and the prefrontal cortex during phonologic processing. The results suggest that dyslexic readers fail to use brain areas that are normally specialized in language processing, but rather use areas that underlie visuospatial processing.

AB  - Attachment anxiety has been associated with a hyperactivating response to threat. A modified emotional Stroop task was used to investigate temporal characteristics of the threat response by assessing response latencies to interpersonally threatening words (immediate interference) and two directly subsequent neutral filler words (delayed interference). Greater immediate and delayed interference to threatening words was observed (n = 125), with higher levels of attachment anxiety associated with immediate interference to threatening cues, and lower levels with delayed interference. Thus, attachment anxiety was related to the speed at which moderate perceived threat disrupted ongoing processes under top-down attentional control. Furthermore, top-down attentional control moderated the extent to which immediate or delayed interference was observed. Among participants who demonstrated relatively stronger top-down attentional control, immediate and delayed interference to threatening cues was minimal, suggesting that results involving emotional Stroop interference were primarily attributable to participants with relatively weaker top-down attentional control. The implications of these findings are considered within the broader context of performance-based and neuroimaging research, with suggestions for future applied research.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is the most common learning disability in school-aged children with an estimated incidence of five to ten percent. The cause and pathophysiological substrate of this developmental disorder is unclear. Recently, a possible involvement of the cerebellum in the pathogenesis of dyslexia has been postulated. In this study, 15 dyslexic children and 7 age-matched control subjects were investigated by means of functional neuroimaging (fMRI) using a noun-verb association paradigm. Comparison of activation patterns between dyslexic and control subjects revealed distinct and significant differences in cerebral and cerebellar activation. Control subjects showed bilaterally well-defined and focal activation patterns in the frontal and parietal lobes and the posterior regions of the cerebellar hemispheres. The dyslexic children, however, presented widespread and diffuse activations on the cerebral and cerebellar level. Cerebral activations were found in frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital regions. Activations in the cerebellum were found predominantly in the cerebellar cortex, including Crus I, Crus II, hemispheric lobule VI, VII and vermal lobules I, II, III, IV and VII. This preliminary study is the first to reveal a significant difference in cerebellar functioning between dyslexic children and controls during a semantic association task. As a result, we propose a new hypothesis regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms of developmental dyslexia. Given the sites of activation in the cerebellum in the dyslexic group, a defect of the intra-cerebellar distribution of activity is suspected, suggesting a disorder of the processing or transfer of information within the cerebellar cortex. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background. The mind's ability to think about the mind has attracted substantial research interest in cognitive science in recent decades, as 'theory of mind'. No research has attempted to identify the brain basis of this ability, probably because it involves several separate processes. As a first step, we investigated one component process - the ability to recognise mental state terms. Method. In Experiment 1, we tested a group of children with autism (known to have theory of mind deficits) and a control group of children with mental handicap, for their ability to recognise mental state terms in a word list. This was to test if the mental state recognition task was related to traditional theory of mind tests. In Experiment 2, we investigated if in the normal brain, recognition of mental state terms might be localised. The procedure employed single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) in normal adult volunteers. We tested the prediction (based on available neurological and animal lesion studies) that there would be increased activation in the orbito-frontal cortex during this task, relative to a control condition, and relative to an adjacent frontal area (frontal-polar cortex). Results. In Experiment 1, the group with autism performed significantly worse than the group without autism. In Experiment 2, there was increased cerebral blood flow during the mental state recognition task in the right orbito-frontal cortex relative to the left frontal-polar region. Conclusions. This simple mental state recognition task appears to relate to theory of mind, in that both are impaired in autism. The SPECT results implicate the orbito-frontal cortex as the basis of this ability.

AB  - Objective Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often present with deficits in episodic memory, and there is evidence that these difficulties may be secondary to executive dysfunction, that is, impaired selection and/or application of memory-encoding strategies (mediation hypothesis). Semantic clustering is an effective strategy to enhance encoding of verbal episodic memory (VEM) when word lists are semantically related. Self-initiated mobilization of this strategy has been associated with increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex, a key region in the pathophysiology of OCD. We therefore studied children and adolescents with OCD during uncued semantic clustering strategy application in a VEM functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-encoding paradigm. Method A total of 25 pediatric patients with OCD (aged 8.1-17.5 years) and 25 healthy controls (HC, aged 8.1-16.9) matched for age, gender, handedness, and IQ were evaluated using a block design VEM paradigm that manipulated semantically related and unrelated words. Results The semantic clustering strategy score (SCS) predicted VEM performance in HC (p &lt;.001, R2 = 0.635), but not in patients (p =.099). Children with OCD also presented hypoactivation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (cluster-corrected p &lt;.001). Within-group analysis revealed a negative correlation between Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and activation of orbitofrontal cortex in the group with OCD. Finally, a positive correlation between age and SCS was found in HC (p =.001, r = 0.635), but not in patients with OCD (p =.936, r = 0.017). Conclusion Children with OCD presented altered brain activation during the VEM paradigm and absence of expected correlation between SCS and age, and between SCS and total words recalled. These results suggest that different neural mechanisms underlie self-initiated semantic clustering in OCD. © 2015 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

AB  - Autobiographical memory (AM) is a critically important form of memory for life events that undergoes substantial developmental changes from childhood to adulthood. Relatively little is known regarding the functional neural correlates of AM retrieval in children as assessed with fMRI, and how they may differ from adults. We investigated this question with 14 children ages 8–11 years and 14 adults ages 19–30 years, contrasting AM retrieval with semantic memory (SM) retrieval. During scanning, participants were cued by verbal prompts to retrieve previously selected recent AMs or to verify semantic properties of words. As predicted, both groups showed AM retrieval-related increased activation in regions implicated in prior studies, including bilateral hippocampus, and prefrontal, posterior cingulate, and parietal cortices. Adults showed greater activation in the hippocampal/parahippocampal region as well as prefrontal and parietal cortex, relative to children; age-related differences were most prominent in the first 8 sec versus the second 8 sec of AM retrieval and when AM retrieval was contrasted with semantic retrieval. This study is the first to characterise similarities and differences during AM retrieval in children and adults using fMRI. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Importance: Pediatric disorders characterized by behavioral and emotional dysregulation pose diagnostic and treatment challenges because of high comorbidity, suggesting that theymay be better conceptualized dimensionally rather than categorically. Identifying neuroimaging measures associated with behavioral and emotional dysregulation in youth may inform understanding of underlying dimensional vs disorder-specific pathophysiologic features. Objective: To identify, in a large cohort of behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth, neuroimaging measures that (1) are associated with behavioral and emotional dysregulation pathologic dimensions (behavioral and emotional dysregulation measured with the Parent General Behavior Inventory 10-Item Mania Scale [PGBI-10M], mania, depression, and anxiety) or (2) differentiate diagnostic categories (bipolar spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders). Design, setting, and participants: A multisite neuroimaging studywas conducted from February 1, 2011, to April 15, 2012, at 3 academic medical centers: University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Participants included a referred sample of behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study (n = 85) and healthy youth (n = 20). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Region-of-interest analyses examined relationships among prefrontal-ventral striatal reward circuitry during a reward paradigm (win, loss, and control conditions), symptom dimensions, and diagnostic categories. Results: Regardless of diagnosis, higher PGBI-10M scores were associated with greater left middle prefrontal cortical activity (r = 0.28) and anxiety with greater right dorsal anterior cingulate cortical (r = 0.27) activity to win. The 20 highest (t = 2.75) and 20 lowest (t = 2.42) PGBI-10M-scoring youth showed significantly greater left middle prefrontal cortical activity to win compared with 20 healthy youth. Disruptive behavior disorders were associated with lower left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity to win (t = 2.68) (all P < .05, corrected). Conclusions and relevance: Greater PGBI-10M-related left middle prefrontal cortical activity and anxiety-related right dorsal anterior cingulate cortical activity to win may reflect heightened reward sensitivity and greater attention to reward in behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth regardless of diagnosis. Reduced left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity to win may reflect reward insensitivity in youth with disruptive behavior disorders. Despite a distinct reward-related neurophysiologic feature in disruptive behavior disorders, findings generally support a dimensional approach to studying neural mechanisms in behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth. © 2014 American Medical Association.

AB  - Syntax allows human beings to build an infinite number of new sentences from a finite stock of words. Because toddlers typically utter only one or two words at a time, they have been thought to have no syntax. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we demonstrated that 2-year-olds do compute syntactic structure when listening to spoken sentences. We observed an early left-lateralized brain response when an expected verb was incorrectly replaced by a noun (or vice versa). Thus, toddlers build on-line expectations as to the syntactic category of the next word in a sentence. In addition, the response topography was different for nouns and verbs, suggesting that different neural networks already underlie noun and verb processing in toddlers, as they do in adults. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The acquisition and evolution of speech production, discourse and communication can be negatively impacted by brain malformations. We describe, for the first time, a case of developmental dynamic dysphasia (DDD) in a right-handed adolescent boy (subject D) with cortical malformations involving language-eloquent regions (inferior frontal gyrus) in both the left and the right hemispheres. Language evaluation revealed a markedly reduced verbal output affecting phonemic and semantic fluency, phrase and sentence generation and verbal communication in everyday life. Auditory comprehension, repetition, naming, reading and spelling were relatively preserved, but executive function was impaired. Multimodal neuroimaging showed a malformed cerebral cortex with atypical configuration and placement of white matter tracts bilaterally and abnormal callosal fibers. Dichotic listening showed right hemisphere dominance for language, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) additionally revealed dissociated hemispheric language representation with right frontal activation for phonology and bilateral dominance for semantic processing. Moreover, subject D also had congenital mirror movements (CMM), defined as involuntary movements of one side of the body that mirror intentional movements of the other side. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and fMRI during voluntary unimanual (left and right) hand movements showed bilateral motor cortex recruitment and tractography revealed a lack of decussation of bilateral corticospinal tracts. Genetic testing aimed to detect mutations that disrupt the development of commissural tracts correlating with CMM (e.g., Germline DCC mutations) was negative. Overall, our findings suggest that DDD in subject D resulted from the underdevelopment of the left inferior frontal gyrus with limited capacity for plastic reorganization by its homologous counterpart in the right hemisphere. Corpus callosum anomalies probably contributed to hinder interhemispheric connectivity necessary to compensate language and communication deficits after left frontal involvement. © Copyright © 2020 Berthier, Dávila, Torres-Prioris, Moreno-Torres, Clarimón, Dols-Icardo, Postigo, Fernández, Edelkraut, Moreno-Campos, Molina-Sánchez, de Zaldivar and López-Barroso.

AB  - The respective roles of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures in memory are controversial. Some authors put forward a modular account according to which episodic memory and recollection-based processes are crucially dependent on the hippocampal formation whereas semantic acquisition and familiarity-based processes rely on the adjacent parahippocampal gyri. Others defend a unitary view.We report the case of VJ, a boy with developmental amnesia of most likely perinatal onset diagnosed at the age of 8. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including quantitative volumetric measurements of the hippocampal formation and of the entorhinal, perirhinal, and temporopolar cortices, showed severe, bilateral atrophy of the hippocampal formation, fornix and mammillary bodies; by contrast, the perirhinal cortex was within normal range and the entorhinal and temporopolar cortex remained within two standard deviations (SDs) from controls' mean. We examined the development of his semantic knowledge from childhood to teenage as well as his recognition and cued recall memory abilities. On tasks tapping semantic memory, VJ increased his raw scores across years at the same rate as children from large standardisation samples, except for one task; he achieved average performance, consistent with his socio-educational background. He performed within normal range on 74% of recognition tests and achieved average to above average scores on 42% of them despite very severe impairment on 82% of episodic recall tasks. Both faces and landscapes-scenes gave rise to above average scores when tested with coloured stimuli. Cued recall, although impaired, was largely superior to free recall.This case supports a modular account of the MTL with episodic, but not semantic memory depending on the hippocampal formation. Furthermore, the overall pattern of findings is consistent with evidence from both brain-damaged and neuroimaging studies indicating that recollection requires intact hippocampal formation and familiarity relies, at least partly, on the adjacent temporal lobe cortex. © 2011 Elsevier Srl.

AB  - Background: Opponent-process theories of externalizing disorders (ExD) attribute them to some combination of overactive reward processing systems and/or underactive behavior inhibition systems. Reward processing has been indexed by recruitment of incentive-motivational neurocircuitry of the ventral striatum (VS), including nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an incentive task to determine whether externalizing symptomatology in adolescence is correlated with an enhanced VS recruitment by cues for rewards, or by deliveries of rewards. Twelve community-recruited adolescents with externalizing disorders (AED) and 12 age/gender-matched controls responded to targets to win or avoid losing $0, $0.20, $1, $5, or an unknown amount (ranging from $0.20 to $5). Results: Cues to respond for rewards activated the NAcc (relative to cues for no incentive), in both subject groups similarly, with greatest NAcc recruitment by cues for the largest reward. Loss-anticipatory NAcc signal increase was detected in a volume-of-interest analysis - but this increase occurred only in trials when subjects hit the target. Relative to controls, AED showed significantly elevated NAcc activation by a linear contrast between reward notification versus notification of failure to win reward. In a post hoc reanalysis, VS and pregenual anterior cingulate activation by the reward versus non-reward outcome contrast also directly correlated with Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Externalizing total scores (across all subjects) in lieu of a binary diagnosis. Finally, both groups showed right insula activation by loss notifications (contrasted with avoided losses). Conclusions: Externalizing behavior, whether assessed dimensionally with a questionnaire, or in the form of a diagnostic categorization, is associated with an exaggerated limbic response to outcomes of reward-directed behavior. This could be a neurobiological signature of the behavioral sensitivity to laboratory reward delivery that is characteristic of children with externalizing symptomatology. Of interest is future research on incentive-motivational processing in more severe, clinically referred AED. © 2009 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

AB  - This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain-behavior correlations in a group of 16 children (9- to 12-year-olds). Activation was measured during a semantic judgment task presented in either the visual or auditory modality that required the individual to determine whether a final word was related in meaning to one of two previous words (e.g., found-tank-lost). The main finding was that higher performers (i.e., accuracy) were associated with more activation in posterior representational systems including the inferior and middle temporal gyri, whereas lower performers were associated with more activation in anterior regions including the inferior and middle frontal gyri. This pattern of results was interpreted as reflecting an elaborated semantic representational system in temporal areas for the high accuracy performers that allowed them to efficiently and accurately make meaning based judgments. The low accuracy performers may have an inaccurate or weakly interconnected semantic system that results in greater use of frontal areas in a feature selection process. © 2005.

AB  - Neuroimaging studies have suggested that left inferior frontal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule and left middle temporal gyrus are critical for semantic processing in normal children. The goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to determine whether these regions are systematically related to semantic processing in children (9- to 15-year-old) diagnosed with reading disorders (RD). Semantic judgments required participants to indicate whether two words were related in meaning. The strength of semantic association varied continuously from higher association pairs (e.g., king-queen) to lower association pairs (e.g. net-ship). We found that the correlation between association strength and activation was significantly weaker for RD children compared to controls in left middle temporal gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule for both the auditory and the visual modalities and in left inferior frontal gyrus for the visual modality. These results suggest that the RD children have abnormalities in semantic search/retrieval in the inferior frontal gyrus, integration of semantic information in the inferior parietal lobule and semantic lexical representations in the middle temporal gyrus. These deficits appear to be general to the semantic system and independent of modality. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The neuroanatomy of developmental differences in lexical processing was examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 15 adults and 15 children. We examined modality specific and modality independent (auditory and visual presentation) patterns of brain activation during spelling, rhyming and meaning judgment tasks. A direct comparison of the modalities revealed that adults showed a large area of activation in the fusiform gyrus for visual word forms and in the superior temporal gyrus for auditory word forms. In contrast, the modality comparison for children revealed no activation in the fusiform gyrus for visual word forms and modest activation in the superior temporal gyrus for auditory word forms. There were also modality independent developmental differences with adults showing more activation than children in the inferior frontal gyrus for the spelling, rhyming and meaning tasks. These results suggest that development is characterized by increasing involvement of the inferior frontal gyrus in lexical processing and by the specialization of unimodal regions for visual and auditory word forms. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - On the development of color naming in young children: Data and theory
AU  - Bornstein, M.H.
T2  - Brain and Language
AB  - Among the semantics of different common attributes of the environment, consistent and correct color naming seems to develop paradoxically late in children, for even young infants discriminate and categorize colors well, color is a salient feature of the child's world, and children are aware of color as a separate domain, know color terms, and respond to color questions with color names. Several specific anomalies characterize early linguistic development in this domain: Errors in beginning color naming are perseverative or random, there seems to be a minimum age for correct and consistent color naming, developmental rate shows wide individual differences, and acquisition among girls is generally faster than among boys. This essay reviews data that support these observations, and evaluates three traditional explanations for them-including the perceptual salience of color for children, experience and learning in the child, and cognitive development-against a fourth new possibility. It is hypothesized that appropriate color naming may depend on the maturation and integration of specific cortical neurological structures; among several interpretations, the neurological one accounts best for diverse characteristics of early color naming. © 1985.

AB  - Impairments in language processing and thought disorder are core symptoms of schizophrenia. Here we used fMRI to investigate functional abnormalities in the neural networks subserving sentence-level language processing in childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS). Fourteen children with COS (mean age: 13.34; IQ: 95) and 14 healthy controls (HC; mean age: 12.37; IQ: 104) underwent fMRI while performing a semantic judgment task previously shown to differentially engage semantic and syntactic processes. We report four main results. First, different patterns of functional specialization for semantic and syntactic processing were observed within each group, despite similar level of task performance. Second, after regressing out IQ, significant between-group differences were observed in the neural correlates of semantic and, to a lesser extent, syntactic processing, with HC children showing overall greater activity than COS children. Third, while these group differences were not related to effects of medications, a significant negative correlation was observed in the COS group between neuroleptic dosage and activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus for the semantic condition. Finally, COS children's level of thought disorder was significantly correlated with task-related activity in language-relevant networks. Taken together, these findings suggest that children with COS exhibit aberrant patterns of neural activity during semantic, and to a lesser extent syntactic, processing and that these functional abnormalities in language-relevant networks are significantly related to severity of thought disorder. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings were made on 25 native English-speaking patients with localization-related epilepsy during a semantic language task (verb generation). Eighteen right-handed subjects with normal reading ability had MEG scans performed during the same language task. MEG data was analyzed by MR-FOCUSS, a current density imaging technique. Detectable MEG signals arising from activation in the left fusiform gyrus, also known as the basal temporal language area (BTLA), occurred at 167 ± 18 ms (n = 43) in all subjects. The BTLA has been associated with a variety of language production and comprehension tasks involving processing of semantic, orthographic, and phonologic information. MEG may become an important tool in efforts to further define the linguistic operations of specific regions within this language area. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Functional neural networks of semantic and syntactic processes in the developing brain
AU  - Brauer, J.
AU  - Friederici, A.D.
T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - The functional neuroanatomy of language in the adult brain separates semantic and syntactic processes in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and in the inferior frontal cortex. It is unknown whether a similar specialization is present in the developing brain. Semantic and syntactic aspects of sentence processing were investigated in 5- to 6-year-old children and in adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although adults demonstrated function-specific activations in the STG and the frontal operculum, children showed a large activation overlap for these two language aspects in the STG. Compared to adults, they engaged additional areas in the left and right inferior frontal gyrus, which are known to support resource demanding processes. Thus, the language networks for semantic and syntactic processes are not yet specialized similarly to adults in the developing brain. © 2007 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Purpose: Atypical language organization is more frequently found in patients with refractory partial epilepsy than in healthy controls; however, the reasons for this are not well known. Here we assess the relation between language laterality index (LI) and white-matter tract changes. Methods: Nine patients with refractory partial epilepsy were assessed with a 3-T GE scanner. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of language and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were acquired, For the fMRI, a noun-verb generation task was performed, all images were motion corrected, and activated pixels in classic language areas were counted. The DTI images were acquired in six standard directions with an initial non-diffusion-weighted scan. The "average anisotropy" was determined in a region of interest in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and parietal lobe white matter. An asymmetry index (AI) was calculated for language and DTI. Atypical language lateralization was diagnosed if the lateralization index (Ll)-language was smaller than 0.4. Results: Two of the nine patients had atypical language localization (LI-language, -0,6, and 0.3): both had left temporal DTI asymmetry (LI-DTI, -0,3 and -0.2). The remaining seven patients had typical language localization, and no marked DTI abnormalities. Asymmetry in temporal lobe DTI correlated with LI-language (r = 0.8; p = 0.006). Conclusions: Atypical language lateralization in patients with partial epilepsy may be associated with white-matter tract abnormalities.

AB  - Objective: Our recent electrocorticography (ECoG) study suggested reverse speech, a widely used control task, to be a poor control for non-language-related auditory activity. We hypothesized that this may be due to retained perception as a human voice. We report a follow-up ECoG study in which we contrast forward and reverse speech with a signal-correlated noise (SCN) control task that cannot be perceived as a human voice. Methods: Ten patients were presented 90 audible stimuli, including 30 each of corresponding forward speech, reverse speech, and SCN trials, during ECoG recording with evaluation of gamma activity between 50 and 150. Hz. Results: Sites of the lateral temporal gyri activated throughout speech stimuli were generally less activated by SCN, while some temporal sites seemed to process both human and non-human sounds. Reverse speech trials were associated with activities across the temporal lobe similar to those associated with forward speech. Conclusions: Findings herein externally validate functional neuroimaging studies utilizing SCN as a control for non-language-specific auditory function. Our findings are consistent with the notion that stimuli perceived as originating from a human voice are poor controls for non-language auditory function. Significance: Our findings have implications in functional neuroimaging research as well as improved clinical mapping of auditory functions. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - The present study examined cortical auditory evoked related potentials (AERPs) for the P1-N250 and MMN components in children 9. years of age. The first goal was to investigate whether AERPs respond differentially to vowels and complex tones, and the second goal was to explore how prototypical language formant structures might be reflected in these early auditory processing stages. Stimuli were two synthetic within-category vowels (/y/), one of which was preferred by adult German listeners ("prototypical-vowel"), and analogous complex tones. P1 strongly distinguished vowels from tones, revealing larger amplitudes for the more difficult to discriminate but phonetically richer vowel stimuli. Prototypical language phoneme status did not reliably affect AERPs; however P1 amplitudes elicited by the prototypical-vowel correlated robustly with the ability to correctly identify two prototypical-vowels presented in succession as "same" (r = -0.70) and word reading fluency (r = -0.63). These negative correlations suggest that smaller P1 amplitudes elicited by the prototypical-vowel predict enhanced accuracy when judging prototypical-vowel "sameness" and increased word reading speed. N250 and MMN did not differentiate between vowels and tones and showed no correlations to behavioural measures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To comprehend language, listeners need to encode the relationship between words within sentences. This entails categorizing words into their appropriate word classes. Function words, consistently preceding words from specific categories (e.g., the ballNOUN, I speakVERB), provide invaluable information for this task, and children's sensitivity to such adjacent relationships develops early on in life. However, neighboring words are not the sole source of information regarding an item's word class. Here we examine whether young children also take into account preceding sentence context online during syntactic categorization. To address this question, we use the ambiguous French function word la which, depending on sentence context, can either be used as determiner (the, preceding nouns) or as object clitic (it, preceding verbs). French-learning 18-month-olds’ evoked potentials (ERPs) were recorded while they listened to sentences featuring this ambiguous function word followed by either a noun or a verb (thus yielding a locally felicitous co-occurrence of la + noun or la + verb). Crucially, preceding sentence context rendered the sentence either grammatical or ungrammatical. Ungrammatical sentences elicited a late positivity (resembling a P600) that was not observed for grammatical sentences. Toddlers’ analysis of the unfolding sentence was thus not limited to local co-occurrences, but rather took into account non-adjacent sentence context. These findings suggest that by 18 months of age, online word categorization is already surprisingly robust. This could be greatly beneficial for the acquisition of novel words. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Syntax allows human beings to build an infinite number of sentences from a finite number of words. How this unique, productive power of human language unfolds over the course of language development is still hotly debated. When they listen to sentences comprising newly-learned words, do children generalize from their knowledge of the legal combinations of word categories or do they instead rely on strings of words stored in memory to detect syntactic errors? Using novel words taught in the lab, we recorded Evoked Response Potentials (ERPs) in two-year-olds and adults listening to grammatical and ungrammatical sentences containing syntactic contexts that had not been used during training. In toddlers, the ungrammatical use of words, even when they have been just learned, induced an early left anterior negativity (surfacing 100-400 ms after target word onset) followed by a late posterior positivity (surfacing 700-900 ms after target word onset) that was not observed in grammatical sentences. This late effect was remarkably similar to the P600 displayed by adults, suggesting that toddlers and adults perform similar syntactic computations. Our results thus show that toddlers build on-line expectations regarding the syntactic category of upcoming words in a sentence. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Regions of human ventral extrastriate visual cortex develop specializations for natural categories (e.g., faces) and cultural artifacts (e.g., words). In adults, category-based specializations manifest as greater neural responses in visual regions of the brain (e.g., fusiform gyrus) to some categories over others. However, few studies have examined how these specializations originate in the brains of children. Moreover, it is as yet unknown whether the development of visual specializations hinges on "increases" in the response to the preferred categories, "decreases" in the responses to nonpreferred categories, or "both." This question is relevant to a long-standing debate concerning whether neural development is driven by building up or pruning back representations. To explore these questions, we measured patterns of visual activity in 4-year-old children for 4 categories (faces, letters, numbers, and shoes) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We report 2 key findings regarding the development of visual categories in the brain: 1) the categories "faces" and "symbols" doubly dissociate in the fusiform gyrus before children can read and 2) the development of category-specific responses in young children depends on cortical responses to nonpreferred categories that decrease as preferred category knowledge is acquired. © The Author 2010.

AB  - Priming effects were examined in 40 children (9-15years old) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An orthographic judgment task required participants to determine if two sequentially presented spoken words had the same spelling for the rime. Four lexical conditions were designed: similar orthography and phonology (O+P+), similar orthography but different phonology (O+P-), similar phonology but different orthography (O-P+), and different orthography and phonology (O-P-). In left superior temporal gyrus, there was lower activation for targets in O+P+ than for those in O-P- and higher accuracy was correlated with stronger activation across all lexical conditions. These results provide evidence for phonological priming in children and greater elaboration of phonological representations in higher skill children, respectively. In left fusiform gyrus, there was lower activation for targets in O+P+ and O+P- than for those in O-P-, suggesting that visual similarity resulted in orthographic priming even with only auditory input. In left middle temporal gyrus, there was lower activation for targets in O+P+ than all other lexical conditions, suggesting that converging orthographic and phonological information resulted in a weaker influence on semantic representations. In addition, higher reading skill was correlated with weaker activation in left middle temporal gyrus across all lexical conditions, suggesting that higher skill children rely to a lesser degree on semantics as a compensatory mechanism. Finally, conflict effects but not priming effects were observed in left inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting that this region is involved in resolving conflicting orthographic and phonological information but not in perceptual priming. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Developmental differences in the neurocognitive networks for phonological and semantic processing in Chinese word reading were examined in 13 adults and 13 children using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Rhyming and semantic association judgments were made to two-character words that were presented sequentially in the visual modality. These lexical tasks were compared with a nonlinguistic control task involving judgment of line patterns. The first main finding was that adults showed greater activation than children in right middle occipital gyrus on both the meaning and rhyming task, suggesting adults more effectively engage right hemisphere brain regions involved in the visual-spatial analysis of Chinese characters. The second main finding was that adults showed greater activation than children in left inferior parietal lobule for the rhyming as compared with the meaning task, suggesting greater specialization of phonological processing in adults. The third main finding was that children who had better performance in the rhyming task on characters with conflicting orthographic and phonological information relative to characters with nonconflicting information showed greater activation in left middle frontal gyrus, suggesting greater engagement of brain regions involved in the integration of orthography and phonology. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AU  - Cao, X.-H.

T2  - Perceptual and Motor Skills
AB  - The N170 effect is thought to reflect fast perceptual processing for visual words. While quite a few studies on developmental word-related coarse N170 specialization have been reported, little is known about the appearance of the subtle N170 specialization in processing logographic scripts by Chinese children. The present study investigated the changes of subtle N170 specialization for Chinese logographic script in 32 primary schoolchildren in Grades 2 and 6, and in 16 college students. Participants were required to perform a content-irrelevant color-matching task. The results showed that the subtle N170 specialization for Chinese characters had not emerged in Grade 2 children. Interestingly, both Chinese characters and pseudowords elicited larger N170 responses than stroke combinations in Grade 6 children and adults, which suggested that the subtle N170 specialization for Chinese characters associated with reading learning had achieved adult level in children by Grade 6. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2011.

AB  - A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was performed on a 4-year-old girl with autism. While sedated, she listened to three utterances (numbers, hello, her own first name) played through headphones. Based on analyses of the fMRI data, the amount of total brain activation varied with the content of the utterance. The greatest volume of overall activation was in response to numbers, followed by the word 'hello', with the least activation to her name. Frontal cortex activation was greatest in response to her name, with less activation for numbers, and the least for the word 'hello.' These findings indicate that fMRI can identify and quantify the brain regions that are activated in response to words in children with autism under sedation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.

AB  - ObjectiveYouth who experience interpersonal trauma and have posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) develop cognitive deficits that impact their development. Our goal is to investigate the function of the hippocampus in adolescents with PTSS during a memory processing task.MethodsTwenty-seven adolescents between the ages of 10-17 years (16 with PTSS and 11 healthy controls) encoded and retrieved visually presented nouns (Verbal Declarative Memory Task) while undergoing fMRI scanning.ResultsThe PTSS group demonstrated reduced activation of the right hippocampus during the retrieval component of the task. Further, severity of symptoms of avoidance and numbing correlated with reduced left hippocampal activation during retrieval.ConclusionsDecreased activity of the hippocampus during a verbal memory task may be a neurofunctional marker of PTSS in youth with history of interpersonal trauma. The results of this study may facilitate the development of focused treatments and may be of utility when assessing treatment outcome for PTSS. © The Author 2009.

TI  - Functional-anatomical organization of predicate metaphor processing

T2  - Brain and Language
AB  - The bulk of the research on the neural organization of metaphor comprehension has focused on nominal metaphors and the metaphoric relationships between word pairs. By contrast, little work has been conducted on predicate metaphors using verbs of motion such as "The man fell under her spell." We examined predicate metaphors as compared to literal sentences of motion such as "The child fell under the slide" in an event-related, functional MRI study. Our results demonstrated greater activation in the left inferior frontal cortex and left lateral temporal lobe for predicate metaphors as compared to literal sentences, while no differences were seen in homologous areas of the right hemisphere. We suggest that the results support a neural organization principle for motion processing in which greater abstraction proceeds along a posterior-to-anterior axis within the lateral portion of the left temporal cortex. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have aberrant neural activity during semantic judgments. We aimed to examine age-dependent neural correlates of semantic processing in boys with ASD as compared to typically developing boys (TD). We used functional MRI to investigate 37 boys with ASD (mean age = 13.3 years, standard deviation = 2.4) and 35 age-, sex-, Intelligence quotient (IQ)- and handedness-matched TD boys (mean age = 13.3 years, standard deviation = 2.7) from age 8 to 18 years. Participants had to indicate whether pairs of Chinese characters presented visually were related in meaning. Group (ASD, TD) × Age (Old, Young) ANOVA was used to examine the difference of age-related changes. Direct comparisons between the adolescent group and the child group were also performed. The behavioral results showed that the ASD group had lower accuracy in the related condition relative to the TD group. The neuroimaging results showed greater activation in the cuneus and less activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in boys with ASD than TD boys. Children with ASD produced greater activation in the cuneus than TD children. Adolescents with ASD showed reduced left IFG activation as compared to TD adolescents. Our findings suggest that TD boys may engage more in higher-level processing of retrieving or selecting semantic features while boys with ASD may rely more on lower-level visual processing during semantic judgments. The findings imply different functional organizations of the semantic system between the two groups.

AB  - Older adults perform much like younger adults on language. This similar level of performance, however, may come about through different underlying brain processes. In the present study, we evaluated age-related differences in the brain areas outside the typical language areas among adults using a category decision task. Our results showed that similar activation patterns were found in classical language processing areas across the three age groups although regional lateralization indices in Broca's and Wernicke's areas decreased with age. The greatest differences, however, among the three groups were found primarily in the brain areas not associated with core language functioning including the hippocampus, middle frontal gyrus, ventromedial frontal cortex, medial superior parietal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. Therefore, the non-classical language areas may exhibit an age-related difference between three age groups while the subjects show a similar activation pattern in the core, primary language processing during a semantic decision task. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Semantic knowledge has thematic relations of contiguity based on association and taxonomic relations of similarity based on shared features to form categories. It is unknown if there are distinct brain networks between thematic and taxonomic organizations in children and if this distinction is related to changes in specialized brain regions with age and/or skill. We orthogonally manipulated association strength (strong, weak) and categorical relatedness (high, low) to examine 10- to 14-year-old children over a two-year interval. Moreover, we examined whether initial behavioral performance predicted brain activation changes. Weak versus strong association strength produced greater activation over time in left middle temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus, and initial accuracy predicted activation changes in the latter. Moreover, high versus low categorical relatedness produced greater activation over time in left occipito-temporal cortex and precuneus, and initial accuracy predicted activation changes in the latter. These developmental findings suggest different organization for thematic and taxonomic relations. © 2018

AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to explore the neural correlates of semantic judgments in a group of 8- to 15-year-old Chinese children. Participants were asked to indicate if pairs of Chinese characters presented visually were related in meaning. The related pairs were arranged in a continuous variable according to association strength. Pairs of characters with weaker semantic association elicited greater activation in the mid ventral region (BA 45) of left inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting increased demands on the process of selecting appropriate semantic features. By contrast, characters with stronger semantic association elicited greater activation in left inferior parietal lobule (BA 39), suggesting stronger integration of highly related features. In addition, there was a developmental increase, similar to previously reported findings in English, in left posterior middle temporal gyrus (BA 21), suggesting that older children have more elaborated semantic representations. There were additional age-related increases in the posterior region of left inferior parietal lobule and in the ventral regions of left inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting that reading acquisition relies more on the mapping from orthography to semantics in Chinese children as compared to previously reported findings in English. © 2009 Chou, Chen, Fan, Chen and Booth.

AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to explore the neural correlates of semantic judgments to visual words in a group of 9- to 15-year-old children. Subjects were asked to indicate if word pairs were related in meaning. Consistent with previous findings in adults, children showed activation in bilateral inferior frontal gyri (Brodmann area [BA] 47, 45) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21). Words with strong semantic association elicited significantly greater activation in bilateral inferior parietal lobules (BA 40), suggesting stronger integration of highly related semantic features. By contrast, words with weak semantic association elicited greater activation in left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45) and middle temporal gyrus (BA 21), suggesting more difficult feature search and more extensive access to semantic representations. We also examined whether age and skill explained unique variance in the patterns of activation. Increasing age was correlated with greater activation in left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) and inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), suggesting that older children have more elaborated semantic representations and more complete semantic integration processes, respectively. Decreasing age was correlated with activation in right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22) and decreasing accuracy was correlated with activation in right middle temporal gyrus (BA 21), suggesting the engagement of ancillary systems in the right hemisphere for younger and lower-skill children. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - The N400 and the fourth grade shift
AU  - Coch, D.
T2  - Developmental Science
AB  - While behavioral and educational data characterize a fourth grade shift in reading development, neuroscience evidence is relatively lacking. We used the N400 component of the event-related potential waveform to investigate the development of single word processing across the upper elementary years, in comparison to adult readers. We presented third graders, fourth graders, fifth graders, and college students with a well-controlled list of real words, pseudowords, letter strings, false font strings, and animal name targets. Words and pseudowords elicited similar N400s across groups. False font strings elicited N400s similar to words and letter strings in the three groups of children, but not in college students. The pattern of findings suggests relatively adult-like semantic and phonological processing by third grade, but a long developmental time course, beyond fifth grade, for orthographic processing in this context. Thus, the amplitude of the N400 elicited by various word-like stimuli does not reflect some sort of shift or discontinuity in word processing around the fourth grade. However, the results do suggest different developmental time courses for the processes that contribute to automatic single word reading and the integrative N400. In a developmental event-related potential study investigating the putative fourth grade shift in reading, the amplitude of the N400 component elicited by various word-like stimuli did not reflect a shift or discontinuity in word processing around the fourth grade. False font strings elicited N400s similar to real words and letter strings in third-, fourth-, and fifth-graders, but not in college students, suggesting a relatively long developmental time course - beyond fifth grade - for orthographic processing in this context. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Relationships between maternal education (ME) and both behavioral performances and brain activation during the discrimination of phonemic and nonphonemic sounds were examined using fMRI in children with different levels of phoneme categorization proficiency (CP). Significant relationships were found between ME and intellectual functioning and vocabulary, with a trend for phonological awareness. A significant interaction between CP and ME was seen for nonverbal reasoning abilities. In addition, fMRI analyses revealed a significant interaction between CP and ME for phonemic discrimination in left prefrontal cortex. Thus, ME was associated with differential patterns of both neuropsychological performance and brain activation contingent on the level of CP. These results highlight the importance of examining SES effects at different proficiency levels. The pattern of results may suggest the presence of neurobiological differences in the children with low CP that affect the nature of relationships with ME. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Compared to adults, relatively little is known about autobiographical memory and the ability to imagine fictitious and future scenarios in school-aged children, despite the importance of these functions for development and subsequent independent living. Even less is understood about the effect of early hippocampal damage on children's memory and imagination abilities. To bridge this gap, we devised a novel naturalistic autobiographical memory task that enabled us to formally assess the memory for recent autobiographical experiences in healthy school-aged children. Contemporaneous with the autobiographical memories being formed, the children also imagined and described fictitious scenarios. Having established the performance of healthy school-aged children on these tasks, we proceeded to make comparisons with children (n= 21) who had experienced neonatal hypoxia/ischaemia, and consequent bilateral hippocampal damage. Our results showed that healthy children could recall autobiographical events, including spatiotemporal information and specific episodic details. By contrast, children who had experienced neonatal hypoxia/ischaemia had impaired recall, with the specific details of episodes being lost. Despite this significant memory deficit they were able to construct fictitious scenarios. This is in clear contrast to adults with hippocampal damage, who typically have impaired autobiographical memory and deficits in the construction of fictitious and future scenarios. We speculate that the paediatric patients' relatively intact semantic memory and/or some functionality in their residual hippocampi may underpin their scene construction ability. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In an effort to clarify whether semantic integration is impaired in verbal and nonverbal auditory domains in children with developmental language impairment (a.k.a., LI and SLI), the present study obtained behavioral and neural responses to words and environmental sounds in children with language impairment and their typically developing age-matched controls (ages 7-15 years). Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded while children performed a forced-choice matching task on semantically matching and mismatching visual-auditory, picture-word and picture-environmental sound pairs. Behavioral accuracy and reaction time measures were similar for both groups of children, with environmental sounds eliciting more accurate responses than words. In picture-environmental sound trials, behavioral performance and the brain's response to semantic incongruency (i.e., the N400 effect) of the children with language impairment were comparable to those of their typically developing peers. However, in picture-word trials, children with LI tended to be less accurate than their controls and their N400 effect was significantly delayed in latency. Thus, the children with LI demonstrated a semantic integration deficit that was somewhat specific to the verbal domain. The particular finding of a delayed N400 effect is consistent with the storage deficit hypothesis of language impairment (Kail & Leonard, 1986) suggesting weakened and/or less efficient connections within the language networks of children with LI.

AU  - Davis, T.

AB  - Category knowledge can be explicit, yet not conform to a perfect rule. For example, a child may acquire the rule ''If it has wings, then it is a bird,'' but then must account for exceptions to this rule, such as bats. The current study explored the neurobiological basis of rule-plus-exception learning by using quantitative predictions from a category learning model, SUSTAIN, to analyze behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. SUSTAIN predicts that exceptions require formation of specialized representations to distinguish exceptions from rule-following items in memory. By incorporating quantitative trial-by-trial predictions from SUSTAIN directly into fMRI analyses, we observed medial temporal lobe (MTL) activation consistent with 2 predicted psychological processes that enable exception learning: item recognition and error correction. SUSTAIN explains how these processes vary in the MTL across learning trials as category knowledge is acquired. Importantly, MTL engagement during exception learning was not captured by an alternate exemplar-based model of category learning or by standard contrasts comparing exception and rulefollowing items. The current findings thus provide a well-specified theory for the role of the MTL in category learning, where the MTL plays an important role in forming specialized category representations appropriate for the learning context. © The Author 2011.

AB  - Atypical functional lateralization and specialization for language have been proposed to account for developmental language disorders, yet results from functional neuroimaging studies are sparse and inconsistent. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared children with a specific subtype of specific language impairment affecting structural language (n=21), to a matched group of typically developing children using a panel of four language tasks neither requiring reading nor metalinguistic skills, including two auditory lexico-semantic tasks (category fluency and responsive naming) and two visual phonological tasks based on picture naming. Data processing involved normalizing the data with respect to a matched pairs paediatric template, groups and between-groups analysis, and laterality indices assessment within regions of interest using single and combined task analysis. Children with specific language impairment exhibited a significant lack of left lateralization in all core language regions (inferior frontal gyrus-opercularis, inferior frontal gyrus-triangularis, supramarginal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus), across single or combined task analysis, but no difference of lateralization for the rest of the brain. Between-group comparisons revealed a left hypoactivation of Wernicke's area at the posterior superior temporal/supramarginal junction during the responsive naming task, and a right hyperactivation encompassing the anterior insula with adjacent inferior frontal gyrus and the head of the caudate nucleus during the first phonological task. This study thus provides evidence that this subtype of specific language impairment is associated with atypical lateralization and functioning of core language areas. © 2011 The Author.

AB  - In the context of presurgical mapping or investigation of neurological and developmental disorders in children, language fMRI raises the issue of the design of a tasks panel achievable by young disordered children. Most language tasks shown to be efficient with healthy children require metalinguistic or reading abilities, therefore adding attentional, cognitive and academic constraints that may be problematic in this context. This study experimented a panel of four language tasks that did not require high attentional skills, reading, or metalinguistic abilities. Two reference tasks involving auditory stimulation (words generation from category, "category"; auditory responsive naming, "definition") were compared with two new tasks involving visual stimulation. These later were designed to tap spontaneous phonological production, in which the names of pictures to be named involve a phonological difference (e.g. in French poule/. boule/. moule; "phon-diff") or change of segmentation (e.g. in French car/car-te/car-t-on; "phon-seg"). Eighteen healthy children participated (mean age: 12.7±3. years). Data processing involved normalizing the data via a matched pairs pediatric template, and inter-task and region of interest analyses with laterality assessment. The reference tasks predominantly activated the left frontal and temporal core language regions, respectively. The new tasks activated these two regions simultaneously, more strongly for the phon-seg task. The union and intersection of all tasks provided more sensitive or specific maps. The study demonstrates that both reference and new tasks highlight core language regions in children, and that the latter are useful for the mapping of spontaneous phonological processing. The use of several different tasks may improve the sensitivity and specificity of fMRI. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Event-related potentials were used to determine whether infants, like adults, show differences in spatial and temporal characteristics of brain activation during face and object recognition. Three aspects of visual processing were identified: (a) differentiation of face vs. object (P400 at occipital electrode was shorter latency for faces), (b) recognition of familiar identity (Nc, or negative component, at fronto-temporal electrodes [FTEs] was of larger amplitude for familiar stimuli), and (c) encoding novelty (slow wave at FTEs was larger for unfamiliar stimuli). The topography of the Nc was influenced by category type: Effects of familiarity were limited to the midline and right anterior temporal electrodes for faces but extended to all temporal electrodes for objects. Results show that infants' experience with specific examples within categories and their general category knowledge influence the neural correlates of visual processing.

AB  - We proposed to explore the functional brain changes during a self-reference processing (SRP) task in adolescents with sexual abuse-related post-traumatic stress disorder (N = 10), compared with healthy adolescents (N = 10). While patients showed no behavioral disturbances in (SRP), they exhibited changes in activity and connectivity in regions involved in emotional regulation (amygdala and dorsal prefrontal cortex) and semantic memory (temporal and ventrolateral prefrontal regions). These preliminary results suggest that these alterations may have an effect on self-esteem which may contribute to a possible retention and impairment of symptoms in adulthood. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We explored how developing neural artifact and animal representations in the dorsal and ventral stream play a role in children's increasingly more proficient interactions with objects. In thirty-three 6- to 10-year-old children and 11 adults, we used fMRI to track the development of (1) the cortical category preference for tools compared to animals and (2) the response to complex objects (as compared to scrambled objects) during a passive viewing task. In addition, we related a cognitive skill that improved substantially from age 6 to 10, namely the ability to recognize tools from unusual viewpoints, to the development of cortical object processing. In multiple complementary analyses we showed that those children who were better at recognizing tools from unusual viewpoints outside the scanner showed a reduced cortical response to tools and animals when viewed inside the scanner, bilaterally in intraparietal and inferotemporal cortex. In contrast, the cortical preference for tools in the dorsal and ventral visual stream did not predict object recognition performance, and was organized in an adult-like manner at six. While cortical tool preference did not change with age, the findings suggest that animal-preferring regions in the ventral visual stream may develop later, concordant with previous reports of a protracted development in similar regions for faces. We thus conclude that intraparietal and inferotemporal cortical networks that support aspects of object processing irrespective of tool or animal category, continue to develop during the school-age years and contribute to the development of object recognition skills during this period. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Learning to read involves associating abstract visual shapes with familiar meanings. Embodiment theories suggest that word meaning is at least partially represented in distributed sensorimotor networks in the brain (Barsalou, 2008; Pulvermueller, 2013). We explored how reading comprehension develops by tracking when and how printed words start activating these "semantic" sensorimotor representations as children learn to read. Adults and children aged 7-10. years showed clear category-specific cortical specialization for tool versus animal pictures during a one-back categorisation task. Thus, sensorimotor representations for these categories were in place at all ages. However, co-activation of these same brain regions by the visual objects' written names was only present in adults, even though all children could read and comprehend all presented words, showed adult-like task performance, and older children were proficient readers. It thus takes years of training and expert reading skill before spontaneous processing of printed words' sensorimotor meanings develops in childhood. © 2014 The Authors.

These findings conflict with the notion of stored visual word forms and instead suggest that this region acts as an interface between visual form information and higher order stimulus properties such as its associated sound and meaning. More importantly, this function is not specific to reading but is also engaged when processing any meaningful visual stimulus. © 2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Aims: To assess the long-term outcome of childhood tuberculous meningitis treated with modern 4-drug antitubercular regimens and to determine predictors of survival and morbidity. Methods: In this single-center prospective cohort, outcome of children with tuberculous meningitis treated with standard regimens was assessed at 6 months and 12 months after discharge using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale. Results: Of 130 children, 38 died in hospital and 34 were either severely disabled or comatose/vegetative at discharge. At 6 and 12 months, 87% of the survivors were either normal (n = 62) or mildly disabled (n = 17, on the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scale). On multivariate analysis, the factors associated with poor outcome at 12 months were stage III at admission (adjusted odds ratio 4.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.7-11.2, P =.002) and presence of infarcts on neuroimaging (adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.6, P =.037). Conclusions: Despite the high in-hospital mortality, in resource-constraint settings, the survivors showed remarkable improvement, with two-thirds returning to a normal functional status at 6 months' follow-up. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Motor outcome is variable following neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (NAIS). We analyzed the relationship between lesion characteristics on brain MRI and motor function in children who had suffered from NAIS. Thirty eight full term born children with unilateral NAIS were investigated at the age of seven. 3D T1- and 3D FLAIR-weighted MR images were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Lesion characteristics were compared between patients with and without cerebral palsy (CP) using the following approaches: lesion localization either using a category-based analysis, lesion mapping as well as voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM). Using diffusion-weighted imaging the microstructure of the cortico-spinal tract (CST) was related to the status of CP by measuring DTI parameters. Whereas children with lesions sparing the primary motor system did not develop CP, CP was always present when extensive lesions damaged at least two brain structures involving the motor system. The VLSM approach provided a statistical map that confirmed the cortical lesions in the primary motor system and revealed that CP was highly correlated with lesions in close proximity to the CST. In children with CP, diffusion parameters indicated microstructural changes in the CST at the level of internal capsule and the centrum semiovale. White matter damage of the CST in centrum semiovale was a highly reproducible marker of CP. This is the first description of the implication of this latter region in motor impairment after NAIS. In conclusion, CP in childhood was closely linked to the location of the infarct in the motor system. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4793-4807, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T2  - Assessment
AB  - The influence of neurological and demographic variables on neuropsychological test performance was examined in 100 9- to 16-year-old children with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Regression analyses were conducted to determine the relative contributions of coma, neuroimaging findings, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and gender to variance in performance on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III), California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C), and the Children's Category Test. Both neurological and demographic variables contributed to performance on various WISC-III factor index scores as well as the CVLT-C. No evidence for a moderating effect of demographic variables was found, but speed of information processing mediated the effect of neurological and demographic variables on CLVT-C performance. It is concluded that demographic variables have an incremental effect on the neuropsychological test performance of children with TBI above and beyond the influence of injury severity. © 2004 Sage Publications.

TI  - A connectionist model of category learning by individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder
AU  - Dovgopoly, A.
AU  - Mercado III, E.
T2  - Cognitive, Affective and Behavioral Neuroscience
AB  - Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show atypical patterns of learning and generalization. We explored the possible impacts of autism-related neural abnormalities on perceptual category learning using a neural network model of visual cortical processing. When applied to experiments in which children or adults were trained to classify complex two-dimensional images, the model can account for atypical patterns of perceptual generalization. This is only possible, however, when individual differences in learning are taken into account. In particular, analyses performed with a self-organizing map suggested that individuals with high-functioning ASD show two distinct generalization patterns: one that is comparable to typical patterns, and a second in which there is almost no generalization. The model leads to novel predictions about how individuals will generalize when trained with simplified input sets and can explain why some researchers have failed to detect learning or generalization deficits in prior studies of category learning by individuals with autism. On the basis of these simulations, we propose that deficits in basic neural plasticity mechanisms may be sufficient to account for the atypical patterns of perceptual category learning and generalization associated with autism, but they do not account for why only a subset of individuals with autism would show such deficits. If variations in performance across subgroups reflect heterogeneous neural abnormalities, then future behavioral and neuroimaging studies of individuals with ASD will need to account for such disparities. © 2013 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

AB  - Learning with discriminative methods is generally based on minimizing the misclassification of training samples, which may be unsuitable for imbalanced datasets where the recognition might be biased in favor of the most numerous class. This problem can be addressed with a generative approach, which typically requires more parameters to be determined leading to reduced performances in high dimension. In such situations, dimension reduction becomes a crucial issue. We propose a feature selection/classification algorithm based on generative methods in order to predict the clinical status of a highly imbalanced dataset made of PET scans of forty-five low-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and thirteen non-ASD low functioning children. ASDs are typically characterized by impaired social interaction, narrow interests, and repetitive behaviors, with a high variability in expression and severity. The numerous findings revealed by brain imaging studies suggest that ASD is associated with a complex and distributed pattern of abnormalities that makes the identification of a shared and common neuroimaging profile a difficult task. In this context, our goal is to identify the rest functional brain imaging abnormalities pattern associated with ASD and to validate its efficiency in individual classification. The proposed feature selection algorithm detected a characteristic pattern in the ASD group that included a hypoperfusion in the right Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) and a hyperperfusion in the contralateral postcentral area. Our algorithm allowed for a significantly accurate (88%), sensitive (91%) and specific (77%) prediction of clinical category. For this imbalanced dataset, with only 13 control scans, the proposed generative algorithm outperformed other state-of-the-art discriminant methods. The high predictive power of the characteristic pattern, which has been automatically identified on whole brains without any priors, confirms previous findings concerning the role of STS in ASD. This work offers exciting possibilities for early autism detection and/or the evaluation of treatment response in individual patients. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - During reading acquisition children learn to recognize orthographic stimuli and link them to phonology and semantics. The present study investigated neurocognitive processes of learning to read after one year of schooling. We aimed to elucidate the cognitive processes underlying neural tuning for print that has been shown to play an important role for reading and dyslexia. A 128-channel EEG was recorded while 68 (Swiss-)German monolingual first grade children (mean age: 7.6) performed a one-back task with different types of letter and false-font strings. Print tuning was indexed by the N1 difference in the ERPs between German words and false-font strings, while the N1 lexicality effect was indexed by the difference between German words and pseudowords. In addition, we measured reading fluency, rapid automatized naming, phonological awareness, auditory memory span, and vocabulary. After one year of formal reading instruction N1 print tuning was clearly present at the group level, and could be detected at the individual level in almost 90% of the children. The N1 lexicality effect, however, could not be reliably found. On the cognitive level, next to word-reading fluency, vocabulary was also associated with N1 print tuning, but not measures reflecting phonological processing. These results demonstrate the presence of print tuning in the first year of reading acquisition and its development at the individual level. Moreover, individual differences in print tuning are not only related to word-reading fluency, but also to semantic knowledge, indicating that at early stages of learning to read the top-down modulation of print tuning is semantic rather than phonological in nature. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a complex manifestation of symptoms that include deficits in social interaction and repetitive or stereotyped interests and behaviors. In keeping with the increasing recognition of the dimensional characteristics of ASD symptoms and the categorical nature of a diagnosis, we sought to delineate the neural mechanisms of ASD symptoms based on the functional connectivity of four known neural networks (i.e., default mode network, dorsal attention network, salience network, and executive control network). Methods We leveraged an open data resource (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) providing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets from 90 boys with ASD and 95 typically developing boys. This data set also included the Social Responsiveness Scale as a dimensional measure of ASD traits. Seed-based functional connectivity was paired with linear regression to identify functional connectivity abnormalities associated with categorical effects of ASD diagnosis, dimensional effects of ASD-like behaviors, and their interaction. Results Our results revealed the existence of dimensional mechanisms of ASD uniquely affecting each network based on the presence of connectivity-behavioral relationships; these were independent of diagnostic category. However, we also found evidence of categorical differences (i.e., diagnostic group differences) in connectivity strength for each network as well as categorical differences in connectivity-behavioral relationships (i.e., diagnosis-by-behavior interactions), supporting the coexistence of categorical mechanisms of ASD. Conclusions Our findings support a hybrid model for ASD characterization that includes a combination of categorical and dimensional brain mechanisms and provide a novel understanding of the neural underpinnings of ASD. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry

TI  - The relationship of gamma oscillations and face-specific ERPs recorded subdurally from occipitotemporal cortex
AU  - Engell, A.D.
AU  - McCarthy, G.
T2  - Cerebral Cortex
AB  - The perception of faces evokes characteristic electrophysiological responses at discrete loci in human fusiform gyrus and adjacent ventral occipitotemporal cortical sites. Prominent among these responses are a surface-negative potential at ∼200-ms postonset (face-N200) and face-induced spectral perturbations in the gamma band (face-γERSP). The degree to which these responses represent activity in the same cortical loci and the degree to which they are influenced by the same perceptual and task variables are unknown. We evaluated this anatomical colocalization and functional correlation in 2 experiments in which the electrocorticogram was recorded from subdural electrodes in 51 participants. Experiment 1 investigated the category specificity of the γERSP and its colocalization with the face-N200. Experiment 2 examined differences in face-N200 and face-γERSP to face stimuli that varied in featural complexity. We found that γERSP is a category-specific phenomenon with separate, though overlapping, category sensitivities as the N200. Further, the presence of face-γERSP at an electrode site significantly predicted the presence and amplitude of face-N200 at that site. However, the converse was not true in that face-N200 was evoked by impoverished face stimuli that did not induce face-γERSP. These results demonstrate that these electrophysiological responses reflect separate components of the brain's face processing system. © The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Primary objective: The long-term effects of TBI on verbal fluency and related structures, as well as the relation between cognition and structural integrity, were evaluated. It was hypothesized that the group with TBI would evidence poorer performance on cognitive measures and a decrease in structural integrity. Research design: Between a paediatric group with TBI and a group of typically-developing children, the long-term effects of traumatic brain injury were investigated in relation to both structural integrity and cognition. Common metrics for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used as indicators of white matter integrity. Methods and procedures: Using DTI, this study examined ventral striatum (VS) integrity in 21 patients aged 10–18 years sustaining moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) 5–15 years earlier and 16 demographically comparable subjects. All participants completed Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System (D-KEFS) sub-tests. Main outcomes and results: The group with TBI exhibited lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and executive functioning performance and higher apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). DTI metrics correlated with D-KEFS performance (right VS FA with Inhibition errors, right VS ADC with Letter Fluency, left VS FA and ADC with Category Switching). Conclusions: TBI affects VS integrity, even in a chronic phase, and may contribute to executive functioning deficits. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Children with congenital left hemisphere damage due to perinatal stroke are capable of acquiring relatively normal language functions despite experiencing a cortical insult that in adults often leads to devastating lifetime disabilities. Although this observed phenomenon is accepted, its neurobiological mechanisms are not well characterized. In this paper we examined the functional neuroanatomy of lexical processing in 13 children/adolescents with perinatal left hemispheric damage. In contrast to many previous perinatal infarct fMRI studies, we used an event-related design, which allowed us to isolate trial-related activity and examine correct and error trials separately. Using both group and single subject analysis techniques we attempt to address several methodological factors that may contribute to some discrepancies in the perinatal lesion literature. These methodological factors include making direct statistical comparisons, using common stereotactic space, using both single subject and group analyses, and accounting for performance differences. Our group analysis, investigating correct trial-related activity (separately from error trials), showed very few statistical differences in the non-involved right hemisphere between patients and performance matched controls. The single subject analysis revealed atypical regional activation patterns in several patients; however, the location of these regions identified in individual patients often varied across subjects. These results are consistent with the idea that alternative functional organization of trial-related activity after left hemisphere lesions is in large part unique to the individual. In addition, reported differences between results obtained with event-related designs and blocked designs may suggest diverging organizing principles for sustained and trial-related activity after early childhood brain injuries. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Behavioral evidence for an impaired ability to group objects based on similar physical or semantic properties in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been mixed. Here, we recorded brain activity from high-functioning children with ASD as they completed a visual-target detection task. We then assessed the extent to which object-based selective attention automatically generalized from targets to non-target exemplars from the same well-known object class (e.g., dogs). Our results provide clear electrophysiological evidence that children with ASD (N = 17, aged 8-13 years) process the similarity between targets (e.g., a specific dog) and same-category non-targets (SCNT) (e.g., another dog) to a lesser extent than do their typically developing (TD) peers (N = 21). A closer examination of the data revealed striking hemispheric asymmetries that were specific to the ASD group. These findings align with mounting evidence in the autism literature of anatomic underconnectivity between the cerebral hemispheres. Years of research in individuals with TD have demonstrated that the left hemisphere (LH) is specialized toward processing local (or featural) stimulus properties and the right hemisphere (RH) toward processing global (or configural) stimulus properties. We therefore propose a model where a lack of communication between the hemispheres in ASD, combined with typical hemispheric specialization, is a root cause for impaired categorization and the oft-observed bias to process local over global stimulus properties. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study used the N400, an electrophysiological correlate of semantic processing, to investigate 19- and 24-month-old children's ability to integrate the meaning of words in a sentential context. Children listened passively to semantically appropriate sentences and to sentences in which the object noun violates the selection restriction of the verb. The event-related potentials of both age groups revealed an N400 on inappropriate object nouns. This indicates that the children are able to semantically integrate words into sentence contexts. Furthermore, the result implies that selection restrictions are part of the children's first verb representations. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AU  - Friedrich, M.

T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - During their first year of life, infants not only acquire probabilistic knowledge about the phonetic, prosodic, and phonotactic organization of their native language, but also begin to establish first lexical-semantic representations. The present study investigated the sensitivity to phonotactic regularities and its impact on semantic processing in 1-yearolds. We applied the method of event-related brain potentials to 12- and 19-month-old children and to an adult control group. While looking at pictures of known objects, subjects listened to spoken nonsense words that were phonotactically legal (pseudowords) or had phonotactically illegal word onsets (nonwords), or to real words that were either congruous or incongruous to the picture contents. In 19-month-olds and in adults, incongruous words and pseudowords, but not nonwords, elicited an N400 known to reflect mechanisms of semantic integration. For congruous words, the N400 was attenuated by semantic priming. In contrast, 12-month-olds did not show an N400 difference, neither between pseudo- and nonwords nor between incongruous and congruous words. Both 1-year-old groups and adults additionally displayed a lexical priming effect for congruous words, that is, a negativity starting around 100 msec after words onset. One-year-olds, moreover, displayed a phonotactic familiarity effect, that is, a widely distributed negativity starting around 250 msec in 19-month-olds but occurring later in 12-month-olds. The results imply that both lexical priming and phonotactic familiarity already affect the processing of acoustic stimuli in children at 12 months of age. In 19-month-olds, adult-like mechanisms of semantic integration are present in response to phonotactically legal, but not to phonotactically illegal, nonsense words, indicating that children at this age treat pseudowords, but not nonwords, as potential word candidates. © 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

TI  - Differentiation of functional networks during long-term memory retrieval in children and adolescents

AB  - The processes that characterize the neural development of long-term memory (LTM) are largely unknown. In young adults, the degree of activation of a single large-scale memory network corresponds to the level of contextual detail involved; thus, differentiating between autobiographical, episodic, and semantic retrieval. In contrast to young adults, children and adolescents retrieve fewer contextual details, suggesting that they might not yet engage the entire memory circuitry and that this brain recruitment might lack the characteristic contextual differentiation found in adults. Twenty-one children (10–12 years of age), 20 adolescents (14–16 years of age), and 22 young adults (20–35 years of age) were assessed on a previously validated LTM retrieval task, while their brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results demonstrate that children, adolescents, and adults recruit a left-lateralized subset of the large-scale memory network, comprising semantic and language processing regions, with neither developmental group showing evidence of contextual differentiation within this network. Additionally, children and adolescents recruited occipital and parietal regions during all memory recall conditions, in contrast to adults who engaged the entire large-scale memory network, as described previously. Finally, a significant covariance between age and brain activation indicates that the reliance on occipital and parietal regions during memory retrieval decreases with age. These results suggest that both children and adolescents rely on semantic processing to retrieve long-term memories, which, we argue, may restrict the integration of contextual detail required for complex episodic and autobiographical memory retrieval. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Language delay and impairment are salient features of autism. More specifically, there is evidence of atypical semantic organization in autism, but the functional brain correlates are not well understood. The current study used functional MRI to examine activation associated with semantic category decision. Ten high-functioning men with autism spectrum disorder and 10 healthy control subjects matched for gender, handedness, age, and nonverbal IQ were studied. Participants indicated via button press response whether visually presented words belonged to a target category (tools, colors, feelings). The control condition required target letter detection in unpronounceable letter strings. Significant activation for semantic decision in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 44 and 45) was found in the control group. Corresponding activation in the autism group was more limited, with smaller clusters in left inferior frontal areas 45 and 47. Autistic participants, however, showed significantly greater activation compared to controls in extrastriate visual cortex bilaterally (areas 18 and 19), which correlated with greater number of errors on the semantic task. Our findings suggest an important role of perceptual components (possibly visual imagery) during semantic decision, consistent with previous evidence of atypical lexicosemantic performance in autism. In the context of similar findings from younger typically developing children, our results suggest an immature pattern associated with inefficient processing, presumably due to atypical experiential embedding of word acquisition in autism. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We examined developmental differences, in location and extent of fMRI language activation maps, between adults and children while performing a semantic fluency task. We studied 29 adults and 16 children with echo planar imaging BOLD fMRI at 1.5 T using covert semantic verbal fluency (generation of words to categories compared to rest) using a block design. Post task testing was administered to assess performance. Individual data were analyzed with an a priori region of interest approach from t maps (t = 4) and asymmetry indices (AI). Group studies were analyzed using SPM 99 (Wellcome, UK; fixed effect, corrected P &lt; 0.0001). We found no significant differences in location or laterality of activation between adults and children for a semantic verbal fluency task. Adults activated more pixels than children in left inferior frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus, but AIs were the similar across ages (r2 &lt; 0.09). Extent or laterality of activation was not affected by performance (r2 &lt; 0.15). The brain areas that process semantic verbal fluency are similar in children and adults. The laterality of activation does not change appreciably with age and appears to be strongly lateralized by age 7 years. Published 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and consequent apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps have been used for lesion detection and as a predictor of outcome in adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but few studies have been reported in children. We evaluated the role of DWI and ADC for outcome prediction after pediatric TBI (n = 37 TBI; n = 10 controls). Fifteen regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn on ADC maps that were grouped for analysis into peripheral gray matter, peripheral white matter, deep gray and white matter, and posterior fossa. All ROIs excluded areas that appeared abnormal on T2-weighted images (T2WI). Acute injury severity was measured using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and 6-12-month outcomes were assessed using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale (PCPCS) score. Patients were categorized into five groups: (1) controls; (2) all TBI patients; (3) mild/moderate TBI with good outcomes; (4) severe TBI with good outcomes; and (5) severe TBI with poor outcomes. ADC values in the peripheral white matter were significantly reduced in children with severe TBI with poor outcomes (72.8 ± 14.4 × 10-3 mm2/sec) compared to those with severe TBI and good outcomes (82.5 ± 3.8 × 10-3 mm 2/sec; p &lt; 0.05). We also found that the average total brain ADC value alone had the greatest ability to predict outcome and could correctly predict outcome in 84% of cases. Assessment of DWI and ADC values in pediatric TBI is useful in evaluating injury, particularly in brain regions that appear normal on conventional imaging. Early identification of children at high risk for poor outcome may assist in aggressive clinical management of pediatric TBI patients. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Information on normal functional organization and development of the ventral processing stream in 5- to 11-year-old children is minimal. The present fMRI study identified neural correlates for face and object processing in children aged 5-8 and 9-11 years, with data from a similar adult study used for comparison. All age groups showed face-preferential activation in the ventral processing stream, but adults and children aged 9-11 years showed face-preferential loci near the classically defined fusiform face area, whereas children aged 5-8 years showed this activation in the posterior ventral processing stream. In addition, the degree of category-selectivity in other brain regions increased with age. Collectively, these developmental changes may reflect fine-tuning in visual recognition processes based on learning and experience. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - Whether verbal labels help infants visually process and categorize objects is a contentious issue. Using electroencephalography, we investigated whether possessing familiar or novel labels for objects directly enhances 1-year-old children's neural processes underlying the perception of those objects. We found enhanced gamma-band (20-60 Hz) oscillatory activity over the visual cortex in response to seeing objects with labels familiar to the infant (Experiment 1) and those with novel labels just taught to the infant (Experiment 2). No such effect was observed for objects that infants were familiar with but had no label for. These results demonstrate that learning verbal labels modulates how the visual system processes the images of the associated objects and suggest a possible top-down influence of semantic knowledge on object perception. © 2010 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - High-level visual cortex in humans includes functionally defined regions that preferentially respond to objects, faces and places. It is unknown how these regions develop and whether their development relates to recognition memory. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the development of several functionally defined regions including object (lateral occipital complex, LOC)-, face ('fusiform face area', FFA; superior temporal sulcus, STS)- and place ('parahippocampal place area', PPA)-selective cortices in children (ages 7-11), adolescents (12-16) and adults. Right FFA and left PPA volumes were substantially larger in adults than in children. This development occurred by expansion of FFA and PPA into surrounding cortex and was correlated with improved recognition memory for faces and places, respectively. In contrast, LOC and STS volumes and object-recognition memory remained constant across ages. Thus, the ventral stream undergoes a prolonged maturation that varies temporally across functional regions, is determined by brain region rather than stimulus category, and is correlated with the development of category-specific recognition memory. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.

TI  - Reading, dyslexia and the brain
AU  - Goswami, U.
T2  - Educational Research
AB  - Background: Neuroimaging offers unique opportunities for understanding the acquisition of reading by children and for unravelling the mystery of developmental dyslexia. Here, I provide a selective overview of recent neuroimaging studies, drawing out implications for education and the teaching of reading. Purpose: The different neuroimaging technologies available offer complementary techniques for revealing the biological basis of reading and dyslexia. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is most suited to localisation of function, and hence to investigating the neural networks that underpin efficient (or inefficient) reading. Electroencephalography (EEG) is sensitive to millisecond differences in timing, hence it is suited to studying the time course of processing; for example, it can reveal when networks relevant to phonology versus semantics are activated. Magnetic source imaging (MSI) gives information about both location in the brain and the time course of activation. I illustrate how each technology is most suited to answering particular questions about the core neural systems for reading, and how these systems interact, and what might go wrong in the dyslexic brain. Design and methods: Following a brief overview of behavioural studies of reading acquisition in different languages, selected neuroimaging studies of typical development are discussed and analysed. Those studies including the widest age ranges of children have been selected. Neuroimaging studies of developmental dyslexia are then reviewed, focusing on (a) the neural networks recruited for reading, (b) the time course of neural activation and (c) the neural effects of remediation. Representative studies using the different methodologies are selected. It is shown that studies converge in showing that the dyslexic brain is characterised by under-activation of the key neural networks for reading. Conclusions: Different neuroimaging methods can contribute different kinds of data relevant to key questions in education. The most informative studies with respect to causation will be longitudinal prospective studies, which are currently rare. © 2008 NFER.

AB  - Reading is an acquired skill that relies on cognitive-control and language abilities. Home reading environment has been positively correlated with activation in parietal-temporal-occipital association cortex supporting mental imagery and narrative comprehension during a story-listening task in preschool-age children. However, the degree to which maternal reading ability influences early brain development, specifically neural circuits involved with language and reading, is not well understood. The current study explored the relationship between maternal reading ability and functional connectivity within the language network, between the language network and networks related to cognitive control and visual processing, as well as between the language network and the entire brain (network-to-voxel analysis) of preschool-age children during a resting state. Thirteen 4-year-old girls and their mothers participated in this study, involving cognitive testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging, including a resting-state scan. Maternal reading ability was negatively correlated with functional connectivity within the child's language network at rest, and also with areas involved in visual processing, cognitive-control, and semantics. These results suggest that children whose mothers exhibit decreased reading ability may demonstrate a greater engagement of the language network and neural circuits related to visual word recognition, cognitive-control, and semantic processing, which later in life support reading. © 2018

AB  - Language in high-functioning autism is characterized by pragmatic and semantic deficits, and people with autism have a reduced tendency to integrate information. Because the left and right inferior frontal (LIF and RIF) regions are implicated with integration of speaker information, world knowledge, and semantic knowledge, we hypothesized that abnormal functioning of the LIF and RIF regions might contribute to pragmatic and semantic language deficits in autism. Brain activation of sixteen 12-to 18-year-old, high-functioning autistic participants was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging during sentence comprehension and compared with that of twenty-six matched controls. The content of the pragmatic sentence was congruent or incongruent with respect to the speaker characteristics (male/female, child/adult, and upper class/lower class). The semantic-and world-knowledge sentences were congruent or incongruent with respect to semantic expectancies and factual expectancies about the world, respectively. In the semantic-knowledge and world-knowledge condition, activation of the LIF region did not differ between groups. In sentences that required integration of speaker information, the autism group showed abnormally reduced activation of the LIF region. The results suggest that people with autism may recruit the LIF region in a different manner in tasks that demand integration of social information. The Author © 2009.

AB  - The use of syntactic structures on a sentence level is a unique human ability. Functional imaging studies have usually investigated syntax comprehension. However, language production may be performed by different neuronal resources. We have investigated syntax generation on a sentence level with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). BOLD contrast was measured while subjects articulated utterances aloud. In the active condition 'sentence generation' (SG), subjects had to produce subject verb object (SVO) sentences (e.g. "The child throws the ball") according to syntactically incomplete stimuli (e.g. "throw ball child") presented visually. In the control condition 'word reading' (WR), subjects had to read identical stimuli without completing the syntactic structure, while in a second control condition 'sentence reading' (SR), subjects had to read complete sentences. The semantic meaning of all expressions was obvious despite the syntactically incomplete structure in conditions SG and WR. In both contrasts, SG minus WR and SG minus SR, activation was mainly present in the left inferior frontal (BA 44/45) and medial frontal (BA 6) gyri, the superior parietal lobule (BA 7) and the right insula (BA 13). A region of interest analysis revealed significantly stronger left-dominant activation in BA 45 compared to BA 44. Our data illustrates the crucial involvement of the left BA 45 in syntactic encoding and is in line with more recent imaging and brain lesion data on syntax processing on a sentence level, emphasizing the involvement of a distributed left and right hemispheric network in syntax generation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In transparent orthographies, like German, children with developmental dyslexia (DD) are mainly characterized by a reading fluency deficit. The reading fluency deficit might be traced back to a scarce integration of orthographic and phonological representations. In order to address this question, the present study used EEG to investigate the N300, an ERP component which has been associated with the integration of orthographic and phonological representations. Twenty children without DD and 18 children with DD performed a phonological (P)-orthographic (O) matching task (P-O condition), which tapped the integration of orthographic and phonological representations. A control task was applied which did not require the integration of orthographic and phonological representations and consisted only of orthographic information (O-O condition). The O-O condition revealed a similar N300 distribution between groups with a bilateral activity over fronto-temporal electrodes. However, in the P-O condition N300 differentiated the 2 groups of children. The control group revealed greater activity over left fronto-temporal electrodes, whereas the N300 was distributed bilaterally in the group of children with DD suggesting deficient integration of orthographic and phonological representations. These findings might be related to the reading fluency deficit as it was also observed that better reading fluency was correlated with higher (r= -36) and earlier peaking (r= -33) N300 amplitudes in the left hemisphere and attenuated N300 amplitudes (r= .45) in the right hemisphere. Standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (sLORETA) revealed that children with DD rely more on right temporo-parietal brain areas compared to children without DD. Furthermore, in order to rule out that earlier deficient processes might influence the group differences found in the N300, we analyzed the N170 for group differences. We did not find significant differences between children without DD and children with DD. In conclusion the results suggest deficient integration of orthographic and phonological representations in dyslexia, as indexed by the N300, and further highlight how this activity is relevant for fluent reading. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AU  - Herba, C.

AB  - Background: Intact emotion processing is critical for normal emotional development. Recent advances in neuroimaging have facilitated the examination of brain development, and have allowed for the exploration of the relationships between the development of emotion processing abilities, and that of associated neural systems. Methods: A literature review was performed of published studies examining the development of emotion expression recognition in normal children and psychiatric populations, and of the development of neural systems important for emotion processing. Results: Few studies have explored the development of emotion expression recognition throughout childhood and adolescence. Behavioural studies suggest continued development throughout childhood and adolescence (reflected by accuracy scores and speed of processing), which varies according to the category of emotion displayed. Factors such as sex, socio-economic status, and verbal ability may also affect this development. Functional neuroimaging studies in adults highlight the role of the amygdala in emotion processing. Results of the few neuroimaging studies in children have focused on the role of the amygdala in the recognition of fearful expressions. Although results are inconsistent, they provide evidence throughout childhood and adolescence for the continued development of and sex differences in amygdalar function in response to fearful expressions. Studies exploring emotion expression recognition in psychiatric populations of children and adolescents suggest deficits that are specific to the type of disorder and to the emotion displayed. Conclusions: Results from behavioural and neuroimaging studies indicate continued development of emotion expression recognition and neural regions important for this process throughout childhood and adolescence. Methodological inconsistencies and disparate findings make any conclusion difficult, however. Further studies are required examining the relationship between the development of emotion expression recognition and that of underlying neural systems, in particular subcortical and prefrontal cortical structures. These will inform understanding of the neural bases of normal and abnormal emotional development, and aid the development of earlier interventions for children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders. © Association for Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2004.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using positron emission tomography (PET) during overt word and nonword reading tasks to determine structures involved in semantic processing. Ten young, healthy, right-handed subjects were scanned 12 times, twice in each of six specific conditions. Blood flow was measured by 15O- water using standard PET imaging technology. The rCBFs during different cognitive conditions were compared by using analysis of covariance (SPM94), which resulted in three-dimensional maps of those brain regions more active in one condition relative to another. When the subjects read aloud words with difficult or unusual graphemephoneme translations (i.e., third-order approximation to English or irregularly spelled real words), increases in activation were seen in the inferior frontal cortex. When subjects were reading aloud regular and irregular words (which had important semantic components relative to nonwords), activation of the fusiform gyrus was seen. These data are broadly consistent with brain regions generally associated with reading based on other neuropsychological paradigms, and they emphasize the multicomponent aspects of this complex cognitive process.

AB  - During reading, dyslexic readers exhibit more and longer fixations and a higher percentage of regressions than normal readers. It is still a matter of debate, whether these divergent eye movement patterns of dyslexic readers reflect an underlying problem in word processing or whether they are - as the proponents of the magnocellular deficit hypothesis claim - associated with deficient visual perception that is causal for dyslexia. To overcome problems in the empirical linkage of the magnocellular theory with reading, a string processing task is presented that poses similar demands on visual perception (in terms of letter identification) and oculomotor control as reading does. Two experiments revealed no differences in the eye movement patterns of dyslexic and control readers performing this task. Furthermore, no relationship between the functionality of the participants' magnocellular system assessed by the coherent motion task and string processing were found. The perceptual and oculomotor demands required during string processing were functionally equivalent to those during reading and the presented consonant strings had similar visual characteristics as reading material. Thus, a strong inference can be drawn: Dyslexic readers do not seem to have difficulties with the accurate perception of letters and the control of their eye movements during reading - their reading difficulties therefore cannot be explained in terms of oculomotor and visuo-perceptual problems. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural activation during a semantic-classification/object- recognition task in 13 persons with Down syndrome and 12 typically developing control participants (age range 5 12-26 years). A comparison between groups suggested atypical patterns of brain activation for the individuals with Down syndrome. Correlation analyses between an index of visual spatial ability and brain activation depicted a positive relationship between (a) this index and brain activation in regions of the occipital and parietal lobes for the typically developing individuals and (b) the middle and dorsal frontal gyri in the individuals with Down syndrome. These findings supported the authors' hypothesis that persons with Down syndrome demonstrate atypical neural activation compared with typically developing individuals matched for chronological age. © American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.

TI  - Expert individuation of objects increases activation in the fusiform face area of children
AU  - James, T.W.

T2  - NeuroImage
AB  - The role of experience in the development of brain mechanisms for face recognition is intensely debated. Experience with subordinate- and individual-level classification of faces is thought, by some, to be foundational in the development of the specialization of face recognition. Studying children with extremely intense interests (EII) provides an opportunity to examine experience-related changes in non-face object recognition in a population where face expertise is not fully developed. Here, two groups of school-aged children -one group with an EII with Pokémon cards and another group of age-matched controls - underwent fMRI while viewing faces, Pokémon characters, Pokémon objects, and Digimon characters. Pokémon objects were non-character Pokémon cards that experts do not typically individuate during game play and trading. Neither experts nor controls had previous experience with Digimon characters. As expected, experts and controls showed equivalent activation in the fusiform face area (FFA) with face stimuli. As predicted by the expertise hypothesis, experts showed greater activation than controls with Pokémon characters, and showed greater activation with Pokémon characters than Pokémon objects. Experts and controls showed equivalent activation with Digimon characters. However, heightened activation with Digimon characters in both groups suggested that there are other strong influences on the activation of the FFA beyond stimulus characteristics, experience, and classification level. By demonstrating the important role of expertise, the findings are inconsistent with a purely face-specific account of FFA function. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the effects of expertise and categorization level on activation in the FFA in a group of typically developing children. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AU  - Grabowska, A.

AB  - Dyslexia is characterized by a core phonological deficit, although recent studies indicate that semantic impairment also contributes to this condition. In this study, event-related potentials (ERP) were used to examine whether the N400 wave in dyslexic children is modulated by phonological or semantic priming, similarly to age-matched controls. ERPs were recorded while children listened to word lists in which the semantic and phonological congruency of the terminal words were manipulated. No overt judgments were made by participants. In control children the N400 amplitude to both semantically and phonologically incongruent words was enlarged relative to congruent words. Dyslexic children exhibited a dissociation of priming effects depending on whether semantic or phonological primes were used. Semantic priming elicited an N400 effect comparable to controls, though delayed. In phonological priming, the dyslexics differed from controls in both the phonologically incongruent and congruent conditions showing reduced N400 amplitude in the former and enhanced N400 in the latter. This pattern suggests that when faced with phonological priming, dyslexics show abnormal neural responses related to both integration of similarities between the consecutive stimuli and the ability to detect incongruent stimuli. Semantic priming seems relatively intact in dyslexics, however neural responses to contextual incongruency are delayed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Musical training modulates the development of syntax processing in children
AU  - Jentschke, S.
AU  - Koelsch, S.
T2  - NeuroImage
AB  - The question of how musical training can influence perceptual and cognitive abilities of children has been the subject of numerous past studies. However, evidence showing which neural mechanisms underlie changes in cognitive skills in another domain following musical training has remained sparse. Syntax processing in language and music has been shown to rely on overlapping neural resources, and this study compared the neural correlates of language- and music-syntactic processing between children with and without long-term musical training. Musically trained children had larger amplitudes of the ERAN (early right anterior negativity), elicited by music-syntactic irregularities. Furthermore, the ELAN (early left anterior negativity), a neurophysiological marker of syntax processing in language, was more strongly developed in these children, and they furthermore had an enlarged amplitude of a later negativity, assumed to reflect more sustained syntax processing. Thus, our data suggest that the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying syntax processing in music and language are developed earlier, and more strongly, in children with musical training. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

T2  - Journal of Learning Disabilities
AB  - The results from studies using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in adults have largely revealed the involvement of left-hemisphere perisylvian areas in the reading process, including extrastriate visual cortex, inferior parietal regions, superior temporal gyrus, and inferior frontal cortex. Although the recruitment of these regions varies with the particular reading-related task, general networks of regions seem to be uniquely associated with different components of the reading process. For example, visual word form processing is associated with occipital and occipitotemporal sites, whereas reading-relevant phonological processing has been associated with superior temporal, occipitotemporal and inferior frontal sites of the left hemisphere. Such findings are evaluated in light of the technical and experimental limitations encountered in functional brain imaging studies, and the implications for pediatric studies are discussed.

AB  - Around their first birthday infants begin to talk, yet they comprehend words long before. This study investigated the event-related potentials (ERP) responses of nine-month-olds on basic level picture-word pairings. After a familiarization phase of six picture-word pairings per semantic category, comprehension for novel exemplars was tested in a picture-word matching paradigm. ERPs time-locked to pictures elicited a modulation of the Negative Central (Nc) component, associated with visual attention and recognition. It was attenuated by category repetition as well as by the type-token ratio of picture context. ERPs time-locked to words in the training phase became more negative with repetition (N300-600), but there was no influence of picture type-token ratio, suggesting that infants have identified the concept of each picture before a word was presented. Results from the test phase provided clear support that infants integrated word meanings with (novel) picture context. Here, infants showed different ERP responses for words that did or did not align with the picture context: a phonological mismatch (N200) and a semantic mismatch (N400). Together, results were informative of visual categorization, word recognition and word-to-world-mappings, all three crucial processes for vocabulary construction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - ERPs to auditory stimuli, generated during an oddball task, were obtained in a group of autistic children and three control groups (normal, ADDH, and dyslectic children, respectively). The task included the presentation of standards, deviants, and novels and had a (between-group) passive vs. active (counting) condition. It was examined whether 1) it was possible to replicate several earlier findings, 2) autistics manifest an abnormal lateralization pattern of ERPs, 3) autistics have an abnormal mismatch negativity (MMN), and 4) differences between autistics and normals are really specific to the autistic group. The only finding that could be replicated was that autistics have a smaller A/Pcz/300. There was no evidence for abnormal lateralization or abnormal MMN; however, there was an unexpected effect of the task manipulation on the amplitude of the P3: in autistics, the occipital P3 to deviant stimuli was significantly larger in the active than in the passive condition, a finding, like the replication of the smaller A/Pcz/300, specific to the autistic group. It was suggested that the auditory occipital task effect is related to understimulation of the occipital lobe by visual stimuli in autistic children. © 1995 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB  - Objective: Contrasts of verbal fluency and automatic speech provide an opportunity to evaluate the neural underpinnings of generativity and flexibility in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Method: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to contrast brain activity in high functioning ASD (n=17, mean verbal IQ=117) and neurotypical (NT; n=20, mean verbal IQ=112) adolescent and young adult males (12-23. years). Participants responded to three word generation conditions: automatic speech (reciting months), category fluency, and letter fluency. Results: Our paradigm closely mirrored behavioral fluency tasks by requiring overt, free recall word generation while controlling for differences in verbal output between the groups and systematically increasing the task demand. The ASD group showed reduced neural response compared to the NT participants during fluency tasks in multiple regions of left anterior and posterior cortices, and sub-cortical structures. Six of these regions fell in cortico-striatal circuits previously linked to repetitive behaviors (Langen, Durston, Kas, van Engeland, & Staal, 2011), and activity in two of them (putamen and thalamus) was negatively correlated with autism repetitive behavior symptoms in the ASD group. In addition, response in left inferior frontal gyrus was differentially modulated in the ASD, relative to the NT, group as a function of task demand. Conclusions: These data indicate a specific, atypical brain response in ASD to demanding generativity tasks that may have relevance to repetitive behavior symptoms in ASD as well as to difficulties generating original verbal responses. © 2013.

AB  - During early ontogeny, the rapid and cumulative acquisition of world knowledge contrasts with slower improvements in the ability to lay down detailed and long-lasting episodic memories. This emphasis on generalization at the expense of specificity persists well into middle childhood and possibly into adolescence. During this period, recognizing regularities, forming stable representations of recurring episodes, predicting the structure of future events, and building up semantic knowledge may be prioritized over remembering specific episodes. We highlight recent behavioral and neuroimaging evidence suggesting that maturational differences among subfields within the hippocampus contribute to the developmental lead–lag relation between generalization and specificity, and lay out future research directions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tools represent a special class of objects, because they are processed across both the dorsal and ventral visual object processing pathways. Three core regions are known to be involved in tool processing: the left posterior middle temporal gyrus, the medial fusiform gyrus (bilaterally), and the left inferior parietal lobule. A critical and relatively unexplored issue concerns whether, in development, tool preferences emerge at the same time and to a similar degree across all regions of the tool-processing network. To test this issue, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the neural amplitude, peak location, and the dispersion of tool-related neural responses in the youngest sample of children tested to date in this domain (ages 4-8 years).We showthat children recruit overlapping regions of the adult tool-processing network and also exhibit similar patterns of co-activation across the network to adults. The amplitude and co-activation data showthat the core components of the toolprocessing network are established by age 4. Our findings on the distributions of peak location and dispersion of activation indicate that the tool network undergoes refinement between ages 4 and 8 years. © The Author 2016.

AB  - The aim of this study was to find the most prominent source of intersubject variability in neuronal activation for reading familiar words aloud. To this end, we collected functional imaging data from a large sample of subjects (n = 76) with different demographic characteristics such as handedness, sex, and age, while reading. The subject-by-subject error variance was estimated from a one-sample t test (on all 76 subjects) and was reduced to a lower dimension using principal components decomposition. A Gaussian Mixture Model was then applied to dissociate different subgroups of subjects that explained the main sources of variability in the data. This resulted in the identification of four different subject groups. The comparison of these subgroups to the subjects' demographic details showed that age had a significant effect on the subject partitioning. In addition, a region-by-group dissociation in the dorsal and the ventral inferior frontal cortex was consistent with previously reported dissociations in semantic and nonsemantic reading strategies. In contrast to these significant findings, the groupings did not differentiate subjects on the basis of either sex or handedness, nor did they segregate the subjects with right- versus leftlateralized reading activation. We therefore conclude that, of the variables tested, age and reading strategy were the most prominent source of variability in activation for reading familiar words aloud. © 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Limited research has been conducted on the structure of the pars triangularis (PT) in dyslexia despite functional neuroimaging research finding it may play a role in phonological processing. Furthermore, research to date has not examined PT size in ADHD even though the right inferior frontal region has been implicated in the disorder. Hence, one of the purposes of this study was to examine the structure of the PT in dyslexia and ADHD. The other purposes included examining the PT in relation to overall expressive language ability and in relation to several specific linguistic functions given language functioning often is affected in both dyslexia and ADHD. Participants included 50 children: 10 with dyslexia, 15 with comorbid dyslexia/ADHD, 15 with ADHD, and 10 controls. Using a 2 (dyslexia or not) × 2 (ADHD or not) MANCOVA, findings revealed PT length and shape were comparable between those with and without dyslexia. However, children with ADHD had smaller right PT lengths than those without ADHD, and right anterior ascending ramus length was related to attention problems in the total sample. In terms of linguistic functioning, presence of an extra sulcus in the left PT was related to poor expressive language ability. In those with adequate expressive language functioning, left PT length was related to phonological awareness, phonological short-term memory and rapid automatic naming (RAN). Right PT length was related to RAN and semantic processing. Further work on PT morphology in relation to ADHD and linguistic functioning is warranted. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Febrile seizures (FS) are assumed to not have adverse long-term effects on cognitive development. Nevertheless, FS are often associated with hippocampal sclerosis which can imply episodic memory deficits. This interrelation has hardly been studied so far. In the current study 13 children who had suffered from FS during infancy and 14 control children (7-9 years old) were examined for episodic and semantic memory with standardized neuropsychological tests. Furthermore, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we studied neuronal activation while the children performed a continuous recognition memory task. The analysis of the behavioral data of the neuropsychological tests and the recognition memory experiment did not reveal any between group differences in memory performance. Consistent with other studies fMRI revealed repetition enhancement effects for both groups in a variety of brain regions (e.g. right middle frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus) and a repetition suppression effect in the right superior temporal gyrus. Different neural activation patterns between both groups were obtained selectively within the right supramarginal gyrus (BA 40). In the control group correct rejections of new items (CRs) were associated with stronger activation than correctly identified old items (HITs) whereas in the FS group no difference occurred. On the background that the right supramarginal gyrus is assumed to mediate a top-down process to internally direct attention towards recollected information, the results could indicate that control children used strategic recollection in order to reject new items (recall-to-reject). In contrast, the missing effect in the FS group could reflect a lack of strategy use, possibly due to impaired recollective processing. This study demonstrates that FS, even with mainly benign courses, can be accompanied by selective modifications in the neural structures underlying recognition memory. © 2012 Kipp, Opitz, Becker, Hofmann, Krick, Gortner and Mecklinger.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by language and communication impairments, social impairments, and repetitive behaviors or restricted interests. Previous studies of semantic functions have found differences in semantic processing and differences in the activation of the language network in adults with ASD compared to controls. The goal of this study is to examine semantic functions in adolescents with ASD compared to typically developing adolescents. We utilized fMRI with a reading version of a response-naming task to investigate activation in 12 right-handed adolescent boys with ASD and 12 typically developing boys. Both groups performed the task at ceiling levels. Boys with ASD had significantly stronger activation than controls in Broca's area, which was less left lateralized in ASD individuals. Controls had a significant correlation between frontal and temporal language area activation in the left hemisphere, whereas ASD adolescents did not. Direct group comparisons revealed additional regions activated in the ASD group relative to the control group. These results suggest differences in semantic organization, approaches to the semantic task, or efficiency in semantic processing in ASD adolescents relative to typically developing adolescents. © 2008 INS.

AB  - Objective: We determined where and when category-preferential augmentation of gamma activity took place during naming of animal or non-animal pictures. Methods: We studied 41 patients with focal epilepsy who underwent measurement of naming-related gamma-augmentation at 50-120. Hz during extraoperative electrocorticography. The assigned task consisted of naming of a visually-presented object classified as either 'animal' or 'non-animal'. Results: Within 80. ms following the onset of picture presentation, regardless of stimulus type, gamma-activity in bilateral occipital regions began to be augmented compared to the resting period. Initially in the occipital poles (at 140. ms and after) and subsequently in the lateral, inferior and medial occipital regions (at 320. ms and after), the degree of gamma-augmentation elicited by 'animal naming' became larger (by up to 52%) than that by 'non-animal naming'. Immediately prior to the overt response, left inferior frontal gamma-augmentation became modestly larger during 'animal naming' compared to 'non-animal naming'. Conclusions: Animal category-preferential gamma-augmentation sequentially involved the lower- and higher-order visual areas. Relatively larger occipital gamma-augmentation during 'animal naming' can be attributed to the more attentive analysis of animal stimuli including the face. Animal-preferential gamma-augmentation in the left inferior frontal region could be attributed to a need for selective semantic retrieval during 'animal naming'. Significance: A specific program of cortical processing to distinguish an animal (or face) from other objects might be initiated in the lower-order visual cortex. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - The severity of intellectual sequelae and prognosis varies in patients with congenital ocular motor apraxia (COMA). Here, we explored this phenomenon with regard to the accompanying oculomotor signs and gross motor development, as well as the subtentorial structure defects. Ten patients diagnosed with COMA (M:F = 4:6, 4-37 years old) were reviewed. Four individuals who gained the ability to walk at 2 years or earlier showed normal intellect and social skills. Those who walked later often showed accompanying intellectual (5/6) and speech (6/6) disabilities. In this latter group, atypical oculomotor signs for COMA (presence of nystagmus, mild limitation of vertical gaze, slower head thrust, and marked improvement of lateral saccade during early childhood) were often noted (4/6). Minor anomalies of fingers and toes were also common in this group. Neuroimaging was conduced in nine patients (pneumoencepharography 1; computed tomography: 8, magnetic resonance imaging: 2). Dilatation of the fourth ventricle, mainly at the level of the midbrain or upper pons (n = 7), and hypoplastic cerebellar vermis (n = 6) were commonly observed in both the early- and late-walking groups. 'Molar tooth' signs (n = 3) were exclusively noted in the late-walking group, and often accompanied by atypical oculomotor signs (3/3) and intellectual disabilities (2/3). Vermian hypoplasia and dilatation of the fourth ventricle at the upper brainstem level in COMA patients, with or without intellectual disabilities, suggested that the cardinal lesion for OMA may exist in these areas. The presence of a subset of 'atypical' COMA patients may suggest that COMA with subtle infratentorial abnormality represents a heterogeneous disease category, showing similar oculomotor disturbance. This review indicated that clinical and neuroradiological inspection might be valuable for prediction of long-term intellectual prognosis in COMA patients. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study examined language comprehension in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in light of monitoring. It was studied whether individuals with ASD monitor their language perception, and whether monitoring during language perception could be modulated with instructions. We presented higher-level (semantic) linguistic violations and lower-level (orthographic) linguistic violations in a free reading condition and in an instructed condition, recording event-related potentials. For control participants, a monitoring response as tapped by the P600 effect was found to semantically and orthographically incorrect input in both conditions. For participants with ASD, however, a monitoring response to semantically implausible input, tapped by the P600, was found only in the instructed condition. For orthographic errors monitoring was observed both in the free reading and in the instructed condition. This suggests that people with ASD are less inclined than typical individuals to monitor their perception of higher-level linguistic input, but that this can be enhanced with instructions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current study investigated the relevance of semantic processing and stimulus salience for memory performance in young ADHD patients and healthy control participants. 18 male ADHD patients and 15 healthy control children and adolescents participated in an ERP study during a visual memory paradigm with two different encoding tasks requiring either perceptual or semantic processing of neutral and emotional pictures. ADHD patients and healthy controls both showed a more negative slow-wave in response to task cues signalling semantic as compared to perceptual stimulus processing. In contrast to ADHD patients, healthy control children showed a larger increase in memory performance for deeply processed neutral pictures which was accompanied by a more positive mid-latency ERP component (so-called P300) after stimulus onset. Our results demonstrate that ADHD patients succeeded in allocating neural resources in preparation of different task demands. However, this increase in preparatory activation to the semantic task cue did not suffice to support successful processing and encoding of neutral stimuli to the same extent as in healthy controls. These findings provide evidence that ADHD patients show deficits in translating pre-stimulus mobilization of neural resources to successful memory formation in the absence of salient stimulus material. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated multimodal (visual and auditory) semantic and unimodal (visual only) phonological processing in reading disabled (RD) adolescents and non-impaired (NI) control participants. We found reduced activation for RD relative to NI in a number of left-hemisphere reading-related areas across all processing tasks regardless of task type (semantic vs. phonological) or modality (auditory vs. visual modality). Moreover, activation differences in these regions, which included the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus, and the occipitotemporal region, were largely independent of in-scanner performance in our auditory semantic task. That is, although RD participants and NI participants differed in performance in visually presented conditions, they did not differ significantly in the auditory condition, yet similar patterns of reduced activation were observed in these regions across conditions. These findings indicate a neurobiological marker in RD that is independent of task, modality, or performance. These findings are discussed in the context of current neurobiological models of RD. © 2009 The International Dyslexia Association.

AB  - Multiple studies have shown that individuals with a reading disability (RD) demonstrate deficits in posterior left-hemispheric brain regions during reading-related tasks. These studies mainly focused on reading sub-skills, and it remains debated whether such dysfunction is apparent during more ecologically valid reading skills, such as reading fluency. In this fMRI study, reading fluency was systematically varied to characterize neural correlates of reading fluency in 30 children with (RD) and without (typical developing children, TYP) a RD. Sentences were presented at constrained, comfortable, and accelerated speeds, which were determined based on individual reading speed. Behaviorally, RD children displayed decreased performance in several reading-related tasks. Using fMRI, we demonstrated that both TYP and RD children display increased activation in several components of the reading network during fluent reading. When required to read at an accelerated speed, RD children exhibited less activation in the fusiform gyrus (FG) compared with the TYP children. A region of interest analysis substantiated differences in the FG and demonstrated a relationship to behavioral reading performance. These results suggest that the FG plays a key role in fluent reading and that it can be modulated by speed. These results and their implications for remediation strategies should be considered in educational practice. © 2013 Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Patient lesion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have provided convincing evidence that a distributed brain network subserves word knowledge. However, little is known about the structural correlates of this network within the context of typical development and whether anatomical coupling in linguistically relevant regions of cortex varies as a function of vocabulary skill. Here we investigate the association between vocabulary and anatomical coupling in 235 typically developing youth (ages 6-19 years) using structural MRI. The study's primary aim was to evaluate whether higher vocabulary performance was associated with greater vertex-level cortical thickness covariation in distributed regions of cortex known to be associated with word knowledge. Results indicate that better vocabulary skills are associated with greater anatomical coupling in several linguistically relevant regions of cortex, including the left inferior parietal (temporal-parietal junction), inferior temporal, middle frontal, and superior frontal gyri and the right inferior frontal and precentral gyri. Furthermore, in high vocabulary scorers, stronger coupling is found among these regions. Thus, complementing patient and fMRI studies, this is the first investigation to highlight the relevance of anatomical covariance within the cortex to vocabulary skills in typically developing youth, further elucidating the distributed nature of neural systems subserving word knowledge. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Previous research has shown that left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) is a core node in the semantic network, and cross-sectional studies have shown that activation in this region changes developmentally and is related to skill measured concurrently. However, it is not known how functional connectivity with this region changes developmentally, and whether functional connectivity is related to future gains in reading. We conducted a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 30 typically developing children (aged 8–15) to examine whether initial brain measures, including activation and connectivity, can predict future behavioral improvement in a semantic judgment task. Participants were scanned on entering the study (time 1, T1) and a follow-up period of 2 years (time 2, T2). Character pairs were arranged in a continuous variable according to association strength (i.e. strong versus weak), and participants were asked to determine if these visually presented pairs were related in meaning. Our results demonstrated greater developmental changes from time 1 to time 2 for weaker association pairs in the left pMTG for the children (aged 8–11) as compared to the adolescents (aged 12–15). Moreover, the results showed greater developmental changes from time 1 to time 2 for weaker association pairs in connectivity between the pMTG and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) for the children as compared to the adolescents. Furthermore, a hierarchical stepwise regression model revealed that connectivity between the pMTG and IPL in weak association pairs was uniquely predictive of behavioral improvement from time 1 to time 2 for the children, but not the adolescents. Taken together, the activation results suggest relatively rapid development before adolescence of semantic representations in the pMTG. Moreover, the connectivity results of pMTG with IPL tentatively suggest that early development of semantic representations may be facilitated by enhanced engagement of phonological short-term memory. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

T2  - Neuropsychologia
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the developmental changes in a group of normally developing children (aged 8-12) and adolescents (aged 13-16) during semantic processing. We manipulated association strength (i.e. a global reading unit) and semantic radical (i.e. a local reading unit) to explore the interaction of lexical and sublexical semantic information in making semantic judgments. In the semantic judgment task, two types of stimuli were used: visually-similar (i.e. shared a semantic radical) versus visually-dissimilar (i.e. did not share a semantic radical) character pairs. Participants were asked to indicate if two Chinese characters, arranged according to association strength, were related in meaning. The results showed greater developmental increases in activation in left angular gyrus (BA 39) in the visually-similar compared to the visually-dissimilar pairs for the strong association. There were also greater age-related increases in angular gyrus for the strong compared to weak association in the visually-similar pairs. Both of these results suggest that shared semantics at the sublexical level facilitates the integration of overlapping features at the lexical level in older children. In addition, there was a larger developmental increase in left posterior middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) for the weak compared to strong association in the visually-dissimilar pairs, suggesting conflicting sublexical information placed greater demands on access to lexical representations in the older children. All together, these results suggest that older children are more sensitive to sublexical information when processing lexical representations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the neural correlates of semantic judgments to Chinese words in a group of 10-15 year old Chinese children. Two semantic tasks were used: visual-visual versus visual-auditory presentation. The first word was visually presented (i.e. character) and the second word was either visually or auditorily presented, and the participant had to determine if these two words were related in meaning. Different from English, Chinese has many homophones in which each spoken word corresponds to many characters. The visual-auditory task, therefore, required greater engagement of cognitive control for the participants to select a semantically appropriate answer for the second homophonic word. Weaker association pairs produced greater activation in the mid-ventral region of left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45) for both tasks. However, this effect was stronger for the visual-auditory task than for the visual-visual task and this difference was stronger for older compared to younger children. The findings suggest greater involvement of semantic selection mechanisms in the cross-modal task requiring the access of the appropriate meaning of homophonic spoken words, especially for older children. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Idiosyncratic grammars: Syntactic processing in second language comprehension uses subjective feature representations

AB  - Learning the syntax of a second language (L2) often represents a big challenge to L2 learners. Previous research on syntactic processing in L2 has mainly focused on how L2 speakers respond to "objective" syntactic violations, that is, phrases that are incorrect by native standards. In this study, we investigate how L2 learners, in particular those of less than near-native proficiency, process phrases that deviate from their own, "subjective," and often incorrect syntactic representations, that is, whether they use these subjective and idiosyncratic representations during sentence comprehension. We study this within the domain of grammatical gender in a population of German learners of Dutch, for which systematic errors of grammatical gender are well documented. These L2 learners as well as a control group of Dutch native speakers read Dutch sentences containing gender-marked determiner- noun phrases in which gender agreement was either (objectively) correct or incorrect. Furthermore, the noun targets were selected such that, in a high proportion of nouns, objective and subjective correctness would differ for German learners. The ERP results show a syntactic violation effect (P600) for objective gender agreement violations for native, but not for nonnative speakers. However, when the items were re-sorted for the L2 speakers according to subjective correctness (as assessed offline), the P600 effect emerged as well. Thus, rather than being insensitive to violations of gender agreement, L2 speakers are similarly sensitive as native speakers but base their sensitivity on their subjective- sometimes incorrect-representations. © 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Background: Impaired working memory is thought to be a core feature of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous imaging studies investigating working memory in ADHD have used tasks involving different cognitive resources and ignoring the categorical judgments about objects that are essential parts of performance in visual working memory tasks, thus complicating the interpretation of their findings. In the present study, we explored differential neural activation in children and adolescents with ADHD and in healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with the categorical n-back task (CN-BT), which maximized demands for executive reasoning while holding memory demands constant. Methods: A total of 33 drug-naive, right-handed male ADHD without comorbidity (mean age 9.9 ± 2.4. years) and 27 right-handed, healthy male controls (mean age 10.9 ± 2.7. years) were recruited in the present study. Event-related fMRI was used to study differences in brain activity during the CN-BT between the two groups. Results: The two groups did not differ in their accuracy in the CN-BT, although the ADHD patients showed significantly shorter reaction times to correct responses than did the controls. During the CN-BT, both ADHD patients and controls showed significant positive and negative activations by the correct responses, mainly in the sensory-motor pathways and the striato-cerebellum circuit. Additionally, the ADHD patients showed significantly higher activation in the bilateral globus pallidus and the right hippocampus compared with the controls. There was also a positive correlation between hyperactivation of the left globus pallidus and the reaction time to correct responses in ADHD. Conclusions: In contrast to controls, ADHD patients showed neural hyperactivation in the striatum and mediotemporal areas during a working memory task involving categorization. Hyperfunction in these areas might be the pathophysiological foundation of ADHD, related to the deficits of working memory and the impulsive symptoms. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

T2  - NeuroImage
AB  - Neuroimaging studies have identified a common network of brain regions involving the prefrontal and parietal cortices across a variety of working memory (WM) tasks. However, previous studies have also reported category-specific dissociations of activation within this network. In this study, we investigated the development of category-specific activation in a WM task with digits, letters, and faces. Eight-year-old children and adults performed a 2-back WM task while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Overall, children were significantly slower and less accurate than adults on all three WM conditions (digits, letters, and faces); however, within each age group, behavioral performance across the three conditions was very similar. FMRI results revealed category-specific activation in adults but not children in the intraparietal sulcus for the digit condition. Likewise, during the letter condition, category-specific activation was observed in adults but not children in the left occipital-temporal cortex. In contrast, children and adults showed highly similar brain-activity patterns in the lateral fusiform gyri when solving the 2-back WM task with face stimuli. Our results suggest that 8-year-old children do not yet engage the typical brain regions that have been associated with abstract or semantic processing of numerical symbols and letters when these processes are task-irrelevant and the primary task is demanding. Nevertheless, brain activity in letter-responsive areas predicted children's spelling performance underscoring the relationship between abstract processing of letters and linguistic abilities. Lastly, behavioral performance on the WM task was predictive of math and language abilities highlighting the connection between WM and other cognitive abilities in development. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The reading system can be broken down into four basic subcomponents in charge of prelexical, orthographic, phonological, and lexico-semantic processes. These processes need to jointly work together to become a fluent and efficient reader. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we systematically analyzed differences in neural activation patterns of these four basic subcomponents in children (N = 41, 9–13 years) using tasks specifically tapping each component (letter identification, orthographic decision, phonological decision, and semantic categorization). Regions of interest (ROI) were selected based on a meta-analysis of child reading and included the left ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOT), left posterior parietal cortex (PPC), left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA). Compared to a visual baseline task, enhanced activation in vOT and IFG was observed for all tasks with very little differences between tasks. Activity in the dorsal PPC system was confined to prelexical and phonological processing. Activity in the SMA was found in orthographic, phonological, and lexico-semantic tasks. Our results are consistent with the idea of an early engagement of the vOT accompanied by executive control functions in the frontal system, including the bilateral SMA. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Speech-related fMRI activation was examined in six hemispherectomy patients (three left LX, three right RX, four with congenital and two with late-acquired hemiplegia) operated in childhood for the relief of drug-resistant epilepsy. Although the temporal and sensorimotor pattern of activation was similar to that found in neurologically intact control participants, activation in Broca's area and its right homolog varied greatly. Involvement of pars triangularis and orbitalis was found in the three cases with best outcome (two RX, one LX), whereas pars opercularis alone was activated in the two remaining LX patients. The results suggest that distinct subregions of Broca's area and their right homologs can subserve speech and language, and that this variability may determine functional outcome. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective Acute necrotising encephalopathy (ANEC) is a severe, debilitating childhood disorder. We used the ANEC scoring system (ANE-ss) and standardised neurodevelopmental scores to objectively characterise medium and long term outcomes. Methods Retrospective review of children with ANEC at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, from 2005 to 2012. ANE-ss was determined from clinical features and neuroimaging, and neurodevelopmental scores (Pediatric Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended, Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scale and Pediatric Overall Performance Category scale) were applied at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months post diagnosis. Results Seven patients with ANEC were studied. All had a viral prodrome with fever, and encephalopathy at presentation, and received immunotherapy (steroids or immunoglobulin). ANE-ss scores were medium risk in 4 patients and high risk in 3 patients. One died (high risk ANE-ss) and outcome was determined in the 6 survivors. At 1 month post diagnosis, 3 patients (50%) were mildly affected and 3 (50%) were severely affected. Morbidity rates improved by 12 months, with 67% and 33.3% scoring in the mildly affected and severely affected ranges, respectively. Medium risk patients did well with majority having little or no neurological deficits and good outcome scores. Conclusion Mortality and severe morbidity correlated well with high risk ANE-ss. However, our patients with medium risk ANE-ss had good neurodevelopmental sequelae. Serial disability scoring is useful in evaluating the progress of ANEC patients on follow up. Assessment at 1 month post diagnosis can aid prognostication of long term outcome. © 2016 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology

AB  - Previous behavioral studies have suggested that morphological awareness is impaired in Chinese children with reading disability (RD), but how this is reflected in brain alterations is not known. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the current study compared morphological processing in a RD group (11-13 years old) to an age-matched typically developing (TD) group. Participants made semantic relatedness judgments to incongruent word pairs that were either semantically related but did not share a morpheme or semantically unrelated but did share a morpheme. This was compared to conditions where semantic relatedness and morphemic information was congruent. A smaller incongruency effect was found in left dorsal posterior (BA9) and ventral anterior (BA47) inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the RD compared to the TD, suggesting that the RD is less sensitive to morphological information. This was a specific deficit as a phonological control task that manipulated congruency between orthography and phonology did not show group differences in the IFG. Moreover, brain activation in the IFG for the incongruency effect in the semantic task was negatively correlated with reading skill for the RD group only, suggesting that higher skill children with RD may rely on a compensatory whole-word strategy by ignoring the morphemic information. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dyslexia in alphabetic languages has been extensively investigated and suggests a central deficit in orthography to phonology mapping in the left hemisphere. Compared to dyslexia in alphabetic languages, the central deficit for Chinese dyslexia is still unclear. Because of the logographic nature of Chinese characters, some have suggested that Chinese dyslexia should have larger deficits in the semantic system. To investigate this, Chinese children with reading disability (RD) were compared to typically developing (TD) children using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on a rhyming judgment task and on a semantic association judgment task. RD children showed less activation for both tasks in right visual (BA18, 19) and left occipito-temporal cortex (BA 37), suggesting a deficit in visuo-orthographic processing. RD children also showed less activation for both tasks in left inferior frontal gyrus (BA44), which additionally showed significant correlations with activation of bilateral visuo-orthographic regions in the RD group, suggesting that the abnormalities in frontal cortex and in posterior visuo-orthographic regions may reflect a deficit in the connection between brain regions. Analyses failed to reveal larger differences between groups for the semantic compared to the rhyming task, suggesting that Chinese dyslexia is similarly impaired in the access to phonology and to semantics from the visual orthography. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The consequences of cortical resection, a treatment for humans with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy, provide a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of the nature and extent of cortical (re)organization. Despite the importance of visual processing in daily life, the neural and perceptual sequellae of occipitotemporal resections remain largely unexplored. Using psychophysical and fMRI investigations, we compared the neural and visuoperceptual profiles of 10 children or adolescents following unilateral cortical resections and their age- and gender-matched controls. Dramatically, with the exception of two individuals, both of whom had relatively greater cortical alterations, all patients showed normal perceptual performance on tasks of intermediate- and high-level vision, including face and object recognition. Consistently, again with the exception of the same two individuals, both univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses revealed normal selectivity and representational structure of category-selective regions. Furthermore, the spatial organization of category-selective regions obeyed the typical medial-to-lateral topographic organization albeit unilaterally in the structurally preserved hemisphere rather than bilaterally. These findings offer novel insights into the malleability of cortex in the pediatric population and suggest that, although experience may be necessary for the emergence of neural category-selectivity, this emergence is not necessarily contingent on the integrity of particular cortical structures.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT One approach to reduce seizure activity in patients with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy involves the resection of the epileptogenic focus. The impact of these resections on the perceptual behaviors and organization of visual cortex remain largely unexplored. Here, we characterized the visuoperceptual and neural profiles of ventral visual cortex in a relatively large sample of post-resection pediatric patients. Two major findings emerged. First, most patients exhibited preserved visuoperceptual performance across a wide-range of visual behaviors. Second, normal topography, magnitude, and representational structure of category-selective organization were uncovered in the spared hemisphere. These comprehensive imaging and behavioral investigations uncovered novel evidence concerning the neural representations and visual functions in children who have undergone cortical resection, and have implications for cortical plasticity more generally.

AB  - Reading is an important high-level cognitive function of the human brain, requiring interaction among multiple brain regions. Revealing differences between children's large-scale functional brain networks for reading tasks and those of adults helps us to understand how the functional network changes over reading development. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 17 adults (19–28 years old) and 16 children (11–13 years old), and graph theoretical analyses to investigate age-related changes in large-scale functional networks during rhyming and meaning judgment tasks on pairs of visually presented Chinese characters. We found that: (1) adults had stronger inter-regional connectivity and nodal degree in occipital regions, while children had stronger inter-regional connectivity in temporal regions, suggesting that adults rely more on visual orthographic processing whereas children rely more on auditory phonological processing during reading. (2) Only adults showed between-task differences in inter-regional connectivity and nodal degree, whereas children showed no task differences, suggesting the topological organization of adults’ reading network is more specialized. (3) Children showed greater inter-regional connectivity and nodal degree than adults in multiple subcortical regions; the hubs in children were more distributed in subcortical regions while the hubs in adults were more distributed in cortical regions. These findings suggest that reading development is manifested by a shift from reliance on subcortical to cortical regions. Taken together, our study suggests that Chinese reading development is supported by developmental changes in brain connectivity properties, and some of these changes may be domain-general while others may be specific to the reading domain. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Deficits in language and communication are among the core symptoms of autism, a common neurodevelopmental disorder with long-term impairment. Despite the striking nature of the autistic language impairment, knowledge about its corresponding alterations in the brain is still evolving. We hypothesized that the dual stream language network is altered in autism, and that this alteration could be revealed by changes in the relationships between microstructural integrity and functional activation. The study recruited 20 right-handed male youths with autism and 20 carefully matched individually, typically developing (TD) youths. Microstructural integrity of the left dorsal and left ventral pathways responsible for language processing and the functional activation of the connected brain regions were investigated by using diffusion spectrum imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging of a semantic task, respectively. Youths with autism had significantly poorer language function, and lower functional activation in left dorsal and left ventral regions of the language network, compared with TD youths. The TD group showed a significant correlation of the functional activation of the left dorsal region with microstructural integrity of the left ventral pathway, whereas the autism group showed a significant correlation of the functional activation of the left ventral region with microstructural integrity of the left dorsal pathway, and moreover verbal comprehension index was correlated with microstructural integrity of the left ventral pathway. These altered structure-function relationships in autism suggest possible involvement of the dual pathways in supporting deficient semantic processing. © 2013 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The visual attention (VA) span deficit hypothesis of developmental dyslexia posits that impaired multiple element processing can be responsible for poor reading outcomes. In VA span impaired dyslexic children, poor performance on letter report tasks is associated with reduced parietal activations for multiple letter processing. While this hints towards a non-specific, attention-based dysfunction, it is still unclear whether reduced parietal activity generalizes to other types of stimuli. Furthermore, putative links between reduced parietal activity and reduced ventral occipito-temporal (vOT) in dyslexia have yet to be explored. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured brain activity in 12 VA span impaired dyslexic adults and 12 adult skilled readers while they carried out a categorization task on single or multiple alphanumeric or non-alphanumeric characters. While healthy readers activated parietal areas more strongly for multiple than single element processing (right-sided for alphanumeric and bilateral for non-alphanumeric), similar stronger multiple element right parietal activations were absent for dyslexic participants. Contrasts between skilled and dyslexic readers revealed significantly reduced right superior parietal lobule (SPL) activity for dyslexic readers regardless of stimuli type. Using a priori anatomically defined regions of interest, we showed that neural activity was reduced for dyslexic participants in both SPL and vOT bilaterally. Finally, we used multiple regressions to test whether SPL activity was related to vOT activity in each group. In the left hemisphere, SPL activity covaried with vOT activity for both normal and dyslexic readers. In contrast, in the right hemisphere, SPL activity covaried with vOT activity only for dyslexic readers. These results bring critical support to the VA interpretation of the VA Span deficit. In addition, they offer a new insight on how deficits in automatic vOT based word recognition could arise in developmental dyslexia. © 2014 Lobier, Peyrin, Pichat, Le Bas and Valdois.

AB  - Convergent data from neuroimaging, neuropsychological, genetic and neurochemical studies in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have implicated dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which form the cortical arm of the frontostriatal network supporting executive functions. Furthermore, besides the DLPFC and dACC, structural and functional imaging studies have shown abnormalities in key brain regions within distributed cortical networks supporting attention. The conceptualization of neural systems biology in ADHD aims at the understanding of what organizing principles have been altered during development within the brain of a person with ADHD.Characterizing these neural systems using neuroimaging could be critical for the description of structural endophenotypes, and may provide the capability of in vivo categorization and correlation with behavior and genes.

AB  - In the current study, we present a novel fMRI protocol in which words, pseudowords, and other word-like stimuli are passively presented in a rapid, sequential fashion. In this “fast” localizer paradigm, items are presented in groups of four; within sets, words are related in orthographic, phonological, and/or semantic properties. We tested this protocol with a group of skilled adult readers (N=18). Analyses uncovered key regions of the reading network that were sensitive to different component processes at the group level; namely, left fusiform gyrus as well as the pars opercularis subregion of inferior frontal gyrus were sensitive to lexicality; several regions including left precentral gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus were sensitive to spelling-sound consistency; the pars triangularis subregion of inferior frontal gyrus was sensitive to semantic similarity. Additionally, in a number of key brain regions, activation in response to semantically similar words was related to individual differences in reading comprehension outside the scanner. Importantly, these findings are in line with previous investigations of the reading network, yet data were obtained using much less imaging time than comparable paradigms currently available, especially relative to the number of indices of component processes obtained. This feature, combined with the relatively simple nature of the task, renders it appropriate for groups of subjects with a wide range of reading abilities, including children with impairments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Apraxic agraphia is a peripheral writing disorder caused by neurological damage. It induces a lack or loss of access to the motor engrams that plan and programme the graphomotor movements necessary to produce written output. The neural network subserving handwriting includes the superior parietal region, the dorsolateral and medial premotor cortex and the thalamus of the dominant hemisphere. Recent studies indicate that the cerebellum may be involved as well. To the best of our knowledge, apraxic agraphia has not been described on a developmental basis. This paper reports the clinical, neurocognitive and (functional) neuroimaging findings of a 15-year-old left-handed patient with an isolated, non-progressive developmental handwriting disorder consistent with a diagnosis of «apraxic dysgraphia». Gross motor coordination problems were objectified as well but no signs of cerebellar, sensorimotor or extrapyramidal dysfunction of the writing limb were found to explain the apraxic phenomena. Brain MRI revealed no supra- and infratentorial damage but quantified Tc-99m-ECD SPECT disclosed decreased perfusion in the anatomoclinically suspected prefrontal and cerebellar brain regions crucially involved in the planning and execution of skilled motor actions. This pattern of functional depression seems to support the hypothesis that «apraxic dysgraphia» might reflect incomplete maturation of the cerebello-cerebral network involved in handwriting. In addition, it is hypothesized that "apraxic dysgraphia" may have to be considered to represent a distinct nosological category within the group of the developmental dyspraxias following dysfunction of the cerebello-cerebral network involved in planned actions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - A known contributor to adults' superior memory performance compared to children is their differential reliance on an existing knowledge base. Compared to those of adults, children's semantic networks are less accessible and less established, a difference that is also thought to contribute to children's relative resistance to semantically related false alarms. Using the " congruency effect" - the memory advantage of congruity, we manipulated the encoded stimuli in the present experiment such that the use of the knowledge base at encoding was more - or less - accessible in both children and adults. While being scanned, 15 children (ages 8-11) and 18 young adults saw printed noun/color combinations and were asked to indicate whether each combination existed in nature. A subsequent recognition test was administered outside of the scanner. Behaviorally, although overall memory was higher in the adult group compared to the children, both age groups showed the congruency effect to the same extent. A comparison of the neural substrates supporting the congruency effect between adults and children revealed that whereas adults recruited regions primarily associated with semantic-conceptual processing (e.g., the left PFC and parietal and occipito-temporal cortices), children recruited regions earlier in the processing stream (e.g., the right occipital cortex). This evidence supports the hypothesis that early in development, episodic encoding depends more on perceptual systems, whereas top-down frontal control and parietal structures become more prominent in the encoding process with age. This developmental switch contributes to adults' superior memory performance but may render adults more vulnerable to committing semantically based errors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We report the case of a 14-year-old girl suffering from severe developmental visual impairment along with delayed language and cognitive development, and featuring a clear-cut dissociation between spared dorsal and impaired ventral visual pathways. Visual recognition of objects, including faces and printed words, was affected. In contrast, movement perception and visually guided motor control were preserved. Structural MRI was normal on inspection, but Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) revealed reduced grey matter density in the mesial occipital and ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Functional MRI during the perception of line drawings uncovered impaired differentiation which is normally observed at even younger ages: no local category preferences could be identified within the occipito-temporal cortex for faces, houses, words or tools. In contrast, movement-related activations appeared to be normal. Finally, those abnormalities evolved on the background of chronic bilateral occipital epileptic activity, including continuous spike-wave discharges during sleep, which may be considered as the primary cause of non-specific intellectual disability and visual impairment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Neurocomputational Account of Taxonomic Responding and Fast Mapping in Early Word Learning
AU  - Mayor, J.
AU  - Plunkett, K.
T2  - Psychological Review
AB  - We present a neurocomputational model with self-organizing maps that accounts for the emergence of taxonomic responding and fast mapping in early word learning, as well as a rapid increase in the rate of acquisition of words observed in late infancy. The quality and efficiency of generalization of word-object associations is directly related to the quality of prelexical, categorical representations in the model. We show how synaptogenesis supports coherent generalization of word-object associations and show that later synaptic pruning minimizes metabolic costs without being detrimental to word learning. The role played by joint-attentional activities is identified in the model, both at the level of selecting efficient cross-modal synapses and at the behavioral level, by accelerating and refining overall vocabulary acquisition. The model can account for the qualitative shift in the way infants use words, from an associative to a referential-like use, for the pattern of overextension errors in production and comprehension observed during early childhood and typicality effects observed in lexical development. Interesting by-products of the model include a potential explanation of the shift from prototype to exemplar-based effects reported for adult category formation, an account of mispronunciation effects in early lexical development, and extendability to include accounts of individual differences in lexical development and specific disorders such as Williams syndrome. The model demonstrates how an established constraint on lexical learning, which has often been regarded as domain-specific, can emerge from domain-general learning principles that are simultaneously biologically, psychologically, and socially plausible. © 2010 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Background: Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by deficits in social-emotional, social-communicative, and language skills. Behavioral and neuroimaging studies have found that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) evidence abnormalities in semantic processing, with particular difficulties in verbal comprehension. However, it is not known whether these semantic deficits are confined to the verbal domain or represent a more general problem with semantic processing. The focus of the current study was to investigate verbal and meaningful nonverbal semantic processing in high-functioning children with autism (mean age = 5.8 years) using event-related potentials (ERPs). Method: ERPs were recorded while children attended to semantically matching and mismatching picture-word and picture-environmental sound pairs. Results: ERPs of typically developing children exhibited evidence of semantic incongruency detection in both the word and environmental sound conditions, as indexed by elicitation of an N400 effect. In contrast, children with ASD showed an N400 effect in the environmental sound condition but not in the word condition. Conclusions: These results provide evidence for a deficiency in the automatic activation of semantic representations in children with ASD, and suggest that this deficit is somewhat more selective to, or more severe in, the verbal than the nonverbal domain. © 2009 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to dissociate the neural correlates of semantic and phonological processes during word reading and picture naming. Previous studies have addressed this issue by contrasting tasks involving semantic and phonological decisions. However, these tasks engage verbal short-term memory and executive functions that are not required for reading and naming. Here, 20 subjects were instructed to overtly name written words and pictures of objects while their neuronal responses were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Each trial consisted of a pair of successive stimuli that were either semantically related (e.g., "ROBIN-nest"), phonologically related (e.g., "BELL-belt"), unrelated (e.g., "KITE-lobster"), or semantically and phonologically identical (e.g., "FRIDGE-fridge"). In addition, a pair of stimuli could be presented in either the same modality (word-word or picture-picture) or a different modality (word-picture or picture-word). We report that semantically related pairs modulate neuronal responses in a left-lateralized network, including the pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus, the angular gyrus, and the superior frontal gyrus. We propose that these areas are involved in stimulus-driven semantic processes. In contrast, phonologically related pairs modulate neuronal responses in bilateral insula. This region is therefore implicated in the discrimination of similar, competing phonological and articulatory codes. The above effects were detected with both words and pictures and did not differ between the two modalities even with a less conservative statistical threshold. In conclusion, this study dissociates the effects of semantic and phonological relatedness between successive items during reading and naming aloud. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - An event-related potential (ERP) experiment was conducted to investigate the development of orthographic and phonological processing during Chinese sentence reading between school children and adult readers. Participants were visually presented with sentences, word-by-word, and were asked to judge whether the sentences were semantically acceptable. The crucial manipulation was on the sentence-final two-character compound words, which were either correct or incorrect. For the incorrect compounds, the second characters of the base words were replaced by homophonic or orthographically similar characters. ERP results showed that, across participant groups, the peak of P200 appeared earlier for the homophonic condition than for the orthographic and the baseline conditions. Importantly, for both child and adult readers, relative to the baseline, both orthographic mismatch in the homophonic condition and phonological mismatch in the orthographic condition elicited N400 effects. While for adults these effects appeared to be equal in size, the peak of the N400 component appeared earlier for orthographic mismatch than for phonological mismatch. For children the N400 effect was larger for orthographic mismatch than for phonological mismatch. The N400 component was also more negative for children than for adults in the homophonic condition, and its peak appeared later for children than for adults in the homophonic and the baseline conditions. Moreover, the offset of the N400 effects appeared earlier for adults than for children and for orthographic mismatch than for phonological mismatch. These findings suggest that both Chinese adult readers and school children rely more on orthographic information than on phonological information to access lexical semantics in reading Chinese sentences. However, the differential effects between orthography and phonology may have different ERP manifestations in adults and children. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Memory formation for newly acquired associations typically depends on hippocampal-neocortical interactions. Through the process of system-consolidation, the mnemonic binding role of the hippocampus is subsequently replaced by cortical hubs, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) or the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). Here, using BOLD-fMRI, we compared retrieval of semantic associations acquired through Fast Mapping (FM), an incidental, exclusion-based learning procedure, to retrieval of similar associations that were intentionally acquired through Explicit Encoding (EE). Despite an identical retrieval task, the encoding histories of the retrieved semantic associations (FM vs. EE) induced distinct neural substrates and disparate related neural dynamics in time. Retrieval of associations acquired through EE engaged the expected hippocampal and vmPFC related networks. Furthermore, retrieval intentionally encoded associations gave rise to a typical overnight increase in engagement of the vmPFC and increased vmPFC-hippocampal-neocortical functional connectivity. On the other hand, retrieval of associations acquired through FM immediately engaged an ATL related network that typically supports well-established semantic knowledge, a network that did not engage the hippocampus and the vmPFC. Moreover, FM learning was associated with minimal overnight changes in the BOLD responses and in the functional connectivity. Our findings indicate that FM may induce a direct, ATL-mediated acquisition and retention of novel arbitrary associations, bypassing the initial hippocampal-cortical representation phase. A direct, ATL-mediated vocabulary acquisition through FM could support the learning and retention of new associations in young children with presumably an immature hippocampal system, and possibly even in amnesic adults with hippocampal lesions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The Ability-Achievement Discrepancy: Does it Contribute to an Understanding of Learning Disabilities?
AU  - Meyer, M.S.
T2  - Educational Psychology Review
AB  - Federal legislation of the 1960s and 1970s extending educational services to learning disabled children contained a criterion requiring a severe discrepancy between an child's ability and achievement. Following a discussion of the historical context related to this decision, research related to discrepancy is reviewed using reading disabilities or dyslexia as the prototype. Topics examined include the relationship of IQ to various factors, including underlying cognitive weaknesses; varying IQ levels; stability of diagnosis; heterogeneity of the diagnostic category; genetic and neuroimaging findings; and appropriate standards of comparison. Research on the practical application of the discrepancy model is also reviewed. In general, there is little evidence to support its continued use. Three proposed alternatives are considered, and a possible model is offered that incorporates findings from research on diagnosis and intervention. © 2000 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies consistently report language-related cerebellar activations, but evidence from the clinical literature is less conclusive. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by testing the effect of focal cerebellar lesions on cerebral activations in a reading task previously shown to involve distinct cerebellar regions. Patients (N = 10) had lesions primarily affecting medial cerebellum, overlapping cerebellar regions activated during the presentation of random word sequences, but distinct from activations related to semantic prediction generation and prediction error processing. In line with this pattern of activation–lesion overlap, patients did not differ from matched healthy controls (N = 10) in predictability-related activations. However, whereas controls showed increased activation in bilateral auditory cortex and parietal operculum when silently reading familiar words relative to viewing letter strings, this effect was absent in the patients. Our results highlight the need for careful lesion mapping and suggest possible roles for the cerebellum in visual-to-auditory mapping and/or inner speech. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Lexical-semantic knowledge is a core language component that undergoes prolonged development throughout childhood and is therefore highly amenable to developmental studies. Most previous lexical-semantic functional MRI (fMRI) studies have been limited to single-word or word-pair tasks, outside a sentence context. Our objective was to investigate the development of lexical-semantic language networks in typically developing children using a more 'ecological' sentence-embedded semantic task that permitted performance monitoring while minimizing head movement by avoiding overt speech. Sixteen adults and 23 children completed two fMRI runs of an auditory lexical-semantic decision task with a button-press response, using reverse speech as control condition. Children and adults showed similar activation in bilateral temporal and left inferior frontal regions. Greater activation in adults than in children was seen in left inferior parietal, premotor, and inferior frontal regions, and in bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA). Specifically for semantically incongruous sentences, adults also showed greater activation than children in left inferior frontal cortex, possibly related to enhanced 'top-down' control. Age-dependent activation increases in motor-related regions were shown to be unrelated to overt motor responses, but could be associated with covert speech accompanying semantic decision. Unlike previous studies, age-dependent differences were not detected in posterior sensory cortices (such as extrastriate cortex), nor in middle temporal gyrus. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and acquired disability in the pediatric population worldwide. We hypothesized that electroencephalography (EEG) synchrony and its temporal variability, analyzed during the acute phase following TBI, would be altered from that of normal children and as such would offer insights into TBI pathophysiology. Seventeen pediatric patients with mild to severe head injury admitted to a pediatric critical care unit were recruited along with 10 age- and gender-matched controls. Patients had two electroencephalographs performed 3 days apart. Outcome was measured at 1 year post-TBI utilizing the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score (PCPC). Maximal synchrony between EEG channels correlated to areas of primary injury as seen on computed tomography (CT) scan. The temporal variability of phase synchronization among EEG electrodes increased as patients recovered and emerged from coma (p < 0.001). This temporal variability correlated with outcome (Pearson coefficient of 0.74) better than the worst Glasgow Coma Scale score, length of coma, or extent of injury on CT scan. This represents a novel approach in the evaluation of TBI in children. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - Event-related brain potential (ERP) studies of sentence processing in adults have shown that phrase-structure violations are associated with two ERP components; an early left anterior negativity (ELAN) and a late, centro-parietal positivity (P600). Although the ELAN reflects highly automatic first-pass sentence parsing, the P600 has been interpreted to reflect later, more controlled processes. The present ERP study investigates the processing of phrase-structure violations in children below three years of age. Both children (mean age of 2.8 years) and adults passively listened to short active sentences that were either correct or syntactically incorrect. Adults displayed an ELAN that was followed by a P600 to the syntactic violation. Children also demonstrated a biphasic ERP pattern consisting of an early left hemispheric negativity and a late positivity. Both components, however, started later and persisted longer than those observed in adults. The left lateralixation of the children's negativity suggests that this component can be interpreted as a child-specific precursor to the ELAN observed in adults. The appearance of the early negativity indicates that the neural mechanisms of syntactic parsing are present, in principle, during early language development. © 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Children's foreign-language (FL) learning is a matter of much social as well as scientific debate. Previous behavioral research indicates that starting language learning late in life can lead to problems in phonological processing. Inadequate phonological capacity may impede lexical learning and semantic processing (phonological bottleneck hypothesis). Using both behavioral and neuroimaging data, here we examine the effects of age of first exposure (AOFE) and total hours of exposure (HOE) to English, on 350 Japanese primary-school children's semantic processing of spoken English. Children's English proficiency scores and N400 event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were analyzed in multiple regression analyses. The results showed (1) that later, rather than earlier, AOFE led to higher English proficiency and larger N400 amplitudes, when HOE was controlled for; and (2) that longer HOE led to higher English proficiency and larger N400 amplitudes, whether AOFE was controlled for or not. These data highlight the important role of amount of exposure in FL learning, and cast doubt on the view that starting FL learning earlier always produces better results. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

AB  - Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficuly in recognizing bodies and faces, which are more pronounced in children than adults. If such difficulties originate from dysfunction of the extrastriate body area (EBA) and the fusiform face area (FFA), activation in these regions might be more atypical in children than in adults. We preformed functional magnetic resonance imaging while children and adults with ASD and age-matched typically developed (TD) individuals observed face, body, car, and scene. To examine various aspects, we performed individual region of interest (ROI) analysis, as well as conventional random effect group analysis. At individual ROI analysis, we examined the ratio of participants showing a category-sensitive response, the size of regions, location and activation patterns among the four object categories. Adults with ASD showed no atypicalities in activation of the EBA and FFA, whereas children with ASD showed atypical activation in these regions. Specifically, a smaller percentage of children with ASD showed face-sensitive activation of the FFA than TD children. Moreover, the size of the EBA was smaller in children with ASD than in TD children. Our results revealed atypicalities in both the FFA and EBA in children with ASD but not in adults with ASD. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and Japan Neuroscience Society

AB  - Visual processing in the primate brain is highly organized along the ventral visual pathway, although it is still unclear how categorical selectivity emerges in this system. While many theories have attempted to explain the pattern of visual specialization within the ventral occipital and temporal areas, the biased connectivity hypothesis provides a framework which postulates extrinsic connectivity as a potential mechanism in shaping the development of category selectivity. As the posterior parietal cortex plays a central role in visual attention, we examined whether the pattern of parietal connectivity with the face and scene processing regions is closely linked with the functional properties of these two visually selective networks in a cohort of 60 children ages 9 to 12. Functionally localized face and scene selective regions were used in deriving each visual network's resting-state functional connectivity. The children's face and scene processing networks appeared to show a weak network segregation during resting state, which was confirmed when compared to that of a group of gender and handedness matched adults. Parietal regions of these children showed differential connectivity with the face and scene networks, and the extent of this differential parietal-visual connectivity predicted individual differences in the degree of segregation between the two visual networks, which in turn predicted individual differences in visual perception performance. Finally, the pattern of parietal connectivity with the face processing network also predicted the foci of face-related activation in the right fusiform gyrus across children. These findings provide evidence that extrinsic connectivity with regions such as the posterior parietal cortex may have important implications in the development of specialized visual processing networks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Maturational constraints on the recruitment of early processes for syntactic processing
AU  - Pakulak, E.

T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - An enduring question in the study of second-language acquisition concerns the relative contributions of age of acquisition (AOA) and ultimate linguistic proficiency to neural organization for second-language processing. Several ERP and neuroimaging studies of second-language learners have found that neural organization for syntactic processing is sensitive to delays in secondlanguage acquisition. However, such delays in second-language acquisition are typically associated with lower language proficiency, rendering it difficult to assess whether differences in AOA or proficiency lead to these effects. Here we examined the effects of delayed second-language acquisition while controlling for proficiency differences by examining participants who differ in AOA but who were matched for proficiency in the same language. We compared the ERP response to auditory English phrase structure violations in a group of late learners of English matched for grammatical proficiency with a group of English native speakers. In the native speaker group, violations elicited a bilateral and prolonged anterior negativity, with onset at 100 msec, followed by a posterior positivity (P600). In contrast, in the nonnative speaker group, violations did not elicit the early anterior negativity, but did elicit a P600 which was more widespread spatially and temporally than that of the native speaker group. These results suggest that neural organization for syntactic processing is sensitive to delays in language acquisition independently of proficiency level. More specifically, they suggest that both early and later syntactic processes are sensitive to maturational constraints. These results also suggest that late learners who reach a high level of second-language proficiency rely on different neural mechanisms than native speakers of that language. © 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - The development of language hemispheric specialization is not well understood in young children, especially regarding expressive language functions. In this study, we investigated age-related changes in expressive language lateralization patterns in a population of children (3-6 and 7-10 years old), adolescents (11-16 years old), and young adults (19-30 years old). During functional near-infrared spectroscopy recordings, all participants performed a verbal fluency task, which consisted in naming as many words as possible belonging to a given semantic category. Hemoglobin concentration changes were measured in bilateral frontal and temporal cortical areas. During the language task, results showed a strong left hemisphere response along with weaker right hemisphere activation in all groups. Age-related increases in hemodynamic responses were found bilaterally, with younger children showing smaller hemodynamic responses than adolescents and adults in both hemispheres. Overall, these findings confirm that a left hemisphere specialization is already established in young children and persists through adulthood. Early left hemisphere specialization for expressive language suggests that language development hinges on structural and functional properties of the human brain with little reorganization occurring with development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - Developmental Science
AB  - Viewing faces or bodies activates category-selective areas of visual cortex, including the fusiform face area (FFA), fusiform body area (FBA), and extrastriate body area (EBA). Here, using fMRI, we investigate the development of these areas, focusing on the right FFA and FBA. Despite the overlap of functionally defined FFA and FBA (54%-75% overlap), we found that these regions developed along different trajectories. With age (7-32 years old), the FFA gradually increased in size and selectivity, and was significantly larger and more face-selective in adults than children. By contrast, the size and selectivity of the FBA did not correlate with age, and were equivalent in children and adults. Whereas in adults the FFA and FBA were comparable in size, in children the FBA was on average 70% larger than the FFA. These findings suggest that, in children, the fusiform gyrus is predominantly selective for bodies, with commensurate face-selective responses apparent later in development. Moreover, differences in the development of the FFA and FBA indicate that overlapping functional brain areas, supported by the same anatomical structure, can develop along different trajectories. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A dissociation between phonological and visual attention (VA) span disorders has been reported in dyslexic children. This study investigates whether this cognitively-based dissociation has a neurobiological counterpart through the investigation of two cases of developmental dyslexia. LL showed a phonological disorder but preserved VA span whereas FG exhibited the reverse pattern. During a phonological rhyme judgement task, LL showed decreased activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus whereas this region was activated at the level of the controls in FG. Conversely, during a visual categorization task, FG demonstrated decreased activation of the parietal lobules whereas these regions were activated in LL as in the controls. These contrasted patterns of brain activation thus mirror the cognitive disorders' dissociation. These findings provide the first evidence for an association between distinct brain mechanisms and distinct cognitive deficits in developmental dyslexia, emphasizing the importance of taking into account the heterogeneity of the reading disorder. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - For the majority of the population, language is a left-hemisphere lateralized function. During childhood, a pattern of increasing left lateralization for language has been described in brain imaging studies, suggesting that this trait develops. This development could reflect change due to brain maturation or change due to skill acquisition, given that children acquire and refine language skills as they mature. We test the possibility that skill acquisition, independent of age-associated maturation can result in shifts in language lateralization in classic language cortex. We imaged adults exposed to an unfamiliar language during three successive fMRI scans. Participants were then asked to identify specific words embedded in Norwegian sentences. Exposure to these sentences, relative to complex tones, resulted in consistent activation in the left and right superior temporal gyrus. Activation in this region became increasingly left-lateralized with repeated exposure to the unfamiliar language. These results demonstrate that shifts in lateralization can be produced in the short term within a learning context, independent of maturation. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Introduction. Pedophiles show sexual interest in prepubescent children but not in adults. Research into the neurofunctional mechanisms of paraphilias has gathered momentum over the last years. Aim. To elucidate the underlying neural processing of sexual interest among pedophiles and to highlight the differences in comparison with nonparaphilic sexual interest in adults. Methods. Nine pedophilic patients and 11 nonpedophilic control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing pictures of nude (prepubescents, pubescents, and adults) and neutral content, as well as performing a concomitant choice reaction time task (CRTT). Main Outcome Measures. Brain blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals and response latencies in the CRTT during exposure to each picture category. Results. Analysis of behavioral data showed group differences in reaction times regarding prepubescent and adult but not pubescent stimuli. During stimulation with pictures displaying nude prepubescents, pedophiles showed increased BOLD response in brain areas known to be involved in processing of visual sexual stimuli. Comparison of pedophilic patients with the control group discovered differences in BOLD responses with respect to prepubescent and adult but not to pubescent stimuli. Differential effects in particular occurred in the cingulate gyrus and insular region. Conclusions. The brain response of pedophiles to visual sexual stimulation by images of nude prepubescents is comparable with previously described neural patterns of sexual processing in nonpedophilic human males evoked by visual stimuli depicting nude adults. Nevertheless, group differences found in the cingulate gyrus and the insular region suggest an important role of these brain areas in pedophilic sexual interest. Furthermore, combining attention-based methods like CRTT with fMRI may be a viable option for future diagnostic procedures regarding pedophilia. © 2011 International Society for Sexual Medicine.

T2  - Developmental Neuropsychology
AB  - We evaluated how right- and the left-temporal lobe activation of first (1st LR), second (2ndLR), and third (3rdLR) level readers (N = 60; Age = 6-9 years) varied with reading level, word characteristics, and cognitive abilities by using electroencephalogram measurements while the children read high-frequency/high-imageability, high-frequency/low-imageability, and nonsense words. The ANOVA showed significant interaction effects: 1stLR had greater right-hemispheric activation than 3rdLR, who had greater left-hemispheric activation; for nonsense words, 1stLR had lower left-hemisphere activation than that of 2ndLR and 3rdLR. The electroencephalogram (EEG) measure of hemispheric asymmetry indicated a developmental effect on lateralized activity in the temporal lobes of beginning readers during word reading.

AB  - Human large-scale functional brain networks are hypothesized to undergo significant changes over development. Little is known about these functional architectural changes, particularly during the second half of the first year of life. We used multivariate pattern classification of resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data obtained in an on-going, multi-site, longitudinal study of brain and behavioral development to explore whether fcMRI data contained information sufficient to classify infant age. Analyses carefully account for the effects of fcMRI motion artifact. Support vector machines (SVMs) classified 6 versus 12 month-old infants (128 datasets) above chance based on fcMRI data alone. Results demonstrate significant changes in measures of brain functional organization that coincide with a special period of dramatic change in infant motor, cognitive, and social development. Explorations of the most different correlations used for SVM lead to two different interpretations about functional connections that support 6 versus 12-month age categorization. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Childhood trauma is a significant risk factor for the development of psychotic disorders, and may influence executive brain functions. We thus set out to investigate the long-term effects of childhood trauma exposure on brain function of adult chronic patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and (psychotic) bipolar-I disorder while performing a standard 2/0-back working memory task. Participants were 50 cases diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (SCZ), 42 cases with bipolar-I disorder (BD), and 47 healthy controls (HC). Among this sample, 56 clinical cases (SCZ = 32; BD = 24) and 17 HC reported significant levels of childhood trauma, while 36 clinical cases (SCZ = 18; BD = 18) and 30 HC did not. Effects of childhood trauma on working memory-related brain activation were examined in combined samples of clinical cases (independently of diagnosis) relative to HCs, as well as within each diagnostic category. Case–control analyses revealed increased activation of the left inferior parietal lobule as a main effect of trauma exposure. In addition, trauma exposure interacted with a diagnosis of SCZ or BD to reveal trauma-related increased activation in the cuneus in clinical cases and decreased activation in this region in controls. Disorder-specific functional alterations were also evident in the SCZ sample, but not BD. Childhood trauma exposure elicits aberrant function of parietal regions involved in working memory performance regardless of clinical status, as well as task-relevant visual regions that participates to attentional processes. Childhood trauma may therefore contribute to alterations in attention in SCZ and BD while performing an n-back working memory task. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - A predominant theory regarding early stroke and its effect on language development, is that early left hemisphere lesions trigger compensatory processes that allow the right hemisphere to assume dominant language functions, and this is thought to underlie the near normal language development observed after early stroke. To test this theory, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain activity during category fluency in participants who had sustained pre-or perinatal left hemisphere stroke (n = 25) and in neurologically normal siblings (n = 27). In typically developing children, performance of a category fluency task elicits strong involvement of left frontal and lateral temporal regions and a lesser involvement of right hemisphere structures. In our cohort of atypically developing participants with early stroke, expressive and receptive language skills correlated with activity in the same left inferior frontal regions that support language processing in neurologically normal children. This was true independent of either the amount of brain injury or the extent that the injury was located in classical cortical language processing areas. Participants with bilateral activation in left and right superior temporal-inferior parietal regions had better language function than those with either predominantly left-or right-sided unilateral activation. The advantage conferred by left inferior frontal and bilateral temporal involvement demonstrated in our study supports a strong predisposition for typical neural language organization, despite an intervening injury, and argues against models suggesting that the right hemisphere fully accommodates language function following early injury. © The Author (2010).

AB  - Traditionally, the ventral occipito-temporal (vOT) area, but not the superior parietal lobules (SPLs), is thought as belonging to the neural system of visual word recognition. However, some dyslexic children who exhibit a visual attention span disorder - i.e. poor multi-element parallel processing - further show reduced SPLs activation when engaged in visual multi-element categorization tasks. We investigated whether these parietal regions further contribute to letter-identity processing within strings. Adult skilled readers and dyslexic participants with a visual attention span disorder were administered a letter-string comparison task under fMRI. Dyslexic adults were less accurate than skilled readers to detect letter identity substitutions within strings. In skilled readers, letter identity differs related to enhanced activation of the left vOT. However, specific neural responses were further found in the superior and inferior parietal regions, including the SPLs bilaterally. Two brain regions that are specifically related to substituted letter detection, the left SPL and the left vOT, were less activated in dyslexic participants. These findings suggest that the left SPL, like the left vOT, may contribute to letter string processing. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We adjusted an object-naming task with repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rnTMS) originally developed for preoperative cortical language mapping in adults in order for it to be used in children. Two series of pictures were chosen for children above and below 10 years of age, respectively. Firstly, the series of pictures and the preferred speed of presentation were assessed for their applicability in children of different ages and abilities. Secondly, these series were used with rnTMS preoperatively in five children with epilepsy. Naming errors induced by the stimulation comprised no response, delayed response, semantic error, phonological error, and self-correction. Language laterality was compared with the results of a dichotic listening test and with neuropsychological tests with respect to general laterality, and general language abilities were considered with respect to the results of stimulation. One participant had below normal general language abilities, two had below-normal rapid naming, and three had slow and indistinct articulation. Laterality was only clear in two of the participants. All children required breaks of various durations during the process, and individual adjustments of the interpicture interval and other stimulation parameters were also made. We conclude that, after adjustment, rnTMS combined with an object-naming task can be useful for preoperative language mapping in children. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hemispheric specialization for language has been the focus of many studies, mainly using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to investigate hemispheric dominance and time-dependent aspects of cortical language processing. We implemented a verb generation task and a newly designed vowel identification task. Eleven healthy adults were investigated. By using oscillatory magnetoencephalography spectral analysis, significant hemispheric differences were found for both tasks in cerebral language areas. Robust left-lateralization in frontal brain regions was observed with the verb generation task, confirming previous functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies. Our new vowel identification task yields significant left-lateralization in posterior language regions, making this silent and child-friendly task a valuable alternative for non-invasive language assessment in difficult populations. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - Semantically reversible sentences are prone to misinterpretation and take longer for typically developing children and adults to comprehend; they are also particularly problematic for those with language difficulties such as aphasia or Specific Language Impairment. In our study, we used fMRI to compare the processing of semantically reversible and nonreversible sentences in 41 healthy participants to identify how semantic reversibility influences neuronal activation. By including several linguistic and nonlinguistic conditions within our paradigm, we were also able to test whether the processing of semantically reversible sentences places additional load on sentence-specific processing, such as syntactic processing and syntactic-semantic integration, or on phonological working memory. Our results identified increased activation for reversible sentences in a region on the left temporal-parietal boundary, which was also activated when the same group of participants carried out an articulation task which involved saying "one, three" repeatedly. We conclude that the processing of semantically reversible sentences places additional demands on the subarticulation component of phonological working memory. © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Using behavioral, structural, and functional imaging techniques, we demonstrate contrasting effects of vocabulary knowledge on temporal and parietal brain structure in 47 healthy volunteers who ranged in age from 7 to 73 years. In the left posterior supramarginal gyrus, vocabulary knowledge was positively correlated with gray matter density in teenagers but not adults. This region was not activated during auditory or visual sentence processing, and activation was unrelated to vocabulary skills. Its gray matter density may reflect the use of an explicit learning strategy that links new words to lexical or conceptual equivalents, as used in formal education and second language acquisition. By contrast, in left posterior temporal regions, gray matter as well as auditory and visual sentence activation correlated with vocabulary knowledge throughout lifespan. We propose that these effects reflect the acquisition of vocabulary through context, when new words are learnt within the context of semantically and syntactically related words. © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Associative learning underlies the formation of new episodic memories. Associative memory improves across development, and this age-related improvement is supported by the development of the hippocampus and pFC. Recent work, however, additionally suggests a role for visual association cortex in the formation of associative memories. This study investigated the role of category-preferential visual processing regions in associative memory across development using a paired associate learning task in a sample of 56 youths (age 6–19 years). Participants were asked to bind an emotional face with an object while undergoing fMRI scanning. Outside the scanner, participants completed a memory test. We first investigated age-related changes in neural recruitment and found linear age-related in- creases in activation in lateral occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus, which are involved in visual processing of objects and faces, respectively. Furthermore, greater activation in these visual processing regions was associated with better subsequent memory for pairs over and above the effect of age and of hippocampal and pFC activation on performance. Recruitment of these visual processing regions mediated the association between age and memory performance, over and above the effects of hippocampal activation. Taken together, these findings extend the existing literature to suggest that greater recruitment of category-preferential visual processing regions during encoding of associative memories is a neural mechanism explaining improved memory across development. © 2017 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Children with specific language impairment (SLI) experience great difficulties in language comprehension and/or production whereby the majority of these children have particular problems in acquiring syntactic rules. In the speech stream boundaries of major syntactic constituents are reliably marked by prosodic cues. Therefore, prosodic information provides an important cue for discovering the syntactic structure of a language [Jusczyk, P.W., 2002. How infants adapt speech-processing capacities to native language structure. Curr. Dir. Psychol. Sci. 11, 15-18.]. Following this, the question is, whether children with SLI differ in the processing of syntactic information from normally developing children and to what extent this is related to the processing of the inherent prosodic information. Children heard either correct sentences or sentences with a word category violation (syntactic level) and a joined prosodic incongruity (prosodic level) while event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Judging the sentence's correctness, control children performed better than children with SLI for all types of sentences. With respect to the ERPs, control children showed a bilateral early starting anterior negativity sustaining into a late anterior negativity and a P600 in posterior regions in response to incorrect sentences. Children with SLI showed a comparable P600 but unlike the control children there was only a late, clearly left lateralized anterior negativity. The complete absence of a right anterior negativity in children with SLI suggests that they may not access prosodic information in the same way normal children do. The differences in prosodic processing may in turn hamper the development of syntactic processing skills as indicated by the absence of the syntax-related early left anterior negativity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current study used event-related brain potentials to investigate lexical-semantic processing of words in sentences spoken by children with specific language impairment and children with normal language development. Children heard correct sentences and sentences with a violation of the selectional restriction of the verb. Control children showed an N400 effect followed by a late positivity for the incorrect sentences. In contrast, children with specific language impairment showed no N400 effect but did show a late, broadly distributed positivity. This absence of the N400 effect is due to a relatively large negativity for correct sentences, suggesting weaker lexical-semantic representations of the verbs and their selectional restrictions in children with specific language impairment. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - High-functioning individuals with autism have been found to favor visuospatial processing in the face of typically poor language abilities. We aimed to examine the neurobiological basis of this difference using functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. We compared 12 children with high functioning autism (HFA) to 12 age- and IQ-matched typically developing controls (CTRL) on a pictorial reasoning paradigm under three conditions: V, requiring visuospatial processing; S, requiring language (i.e., semantic) processing; and V+S, a hybrid condition in which language use could facilitate visuospatial transformations. Activated areas in the brain were chosen as endpoints for probabilistic diffusion tractography to examine tract integrity (FA) within the structural network underlying the activation patterns. The two groups showed similar networks, with linguistic processing activating inferior frontal, superior and middle temporal, ventral visual, and temporo-parietal areas, whereas visuospatial processing activated occipital and inferior parietal cortices. However, HFA appeared to activate occipito-parietal and ventral temporal areas, whereas CTRL relied more on frontal and temporal language regions. The increased reliance on visuospatial abilities in HFA was supported by intact connections between the inferior parietal and the ventral temporal ROIs. In contrast, the inferior frontal region showed reduced connectivity to ventral temporal and middle temporal areas in this group, reflecting impaired activation of frontal language areas in autism. The HFA group's engagement of posterior brain regions along with its weak connections to frontal language areas suggest support for a reliance on visual mediation in autism, even in tasks of higher cognition. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The neural basis of autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) is poorly understood. Studies of mnemonic function in ASD suggest a profile of impaired episodic memory with relative preservation of semantic memory (at least in high-functioning individuals). Such a pattern is consistent with developmental hippocampal abnormality. However, imaging evidence for abnormality of the hippocampal formation in ASD is inconsistent. These inconsistencies led us to examine the memory profile of children with ASD and the relationship to structural abnormalities. A cohort of high-functioning individuals with ASD and matched controls completed a comprehensive neuropsychological memory battery and underwent magnetic resonance imaging for the purpose of voxel-based morphometric analyses. Correlations between cognitive/behavioural test scores and quantified results of brain scans were also carried out to further examine the role of the medial temporal lobe in ASD. A selective deficit in episodic memory with relative preservation of semantic memory was found. Voxel-based morphometry revealed bilateral abnormalities in several areas implicated in ASD including the hippocampal formation. A significant correlation was found between parental ratings reflecting autistic symptomatology and the measure of grey matter density in the junction area involving the amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. The data reveal a pattern of impaired and relatively preserved mnemonic function that is consistent with a hippocampal abnormality of developmental origin. The structural imaging data highlight abnormalities in several brain regions previously implicated in ASD, including the medial temporal lobes. © Federation of European Neuroscience Societies.

AB  - Neuroimaging studies with adults have identified cortical regions recruited when people think about other people's thoughts (theory of mind): temporo-parietal junction, posterior cingulate, and medial prefrontal cortex. These same regions were recruited in 13 children aged 6-11 years when they listened to sections of a story describing a character's thoughts compared to sections of the same story that described the physical context. A distinct region in the posterior superior temporal sulcus was implicated in the perception of biological motion. Change in response selectivity with age was observed in just one region. The right temporo-parietal junction was recruited equally for mental and physical facts about people in younger children, but only for mental facts in older children. © 2009, Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

AB  - Although category-specific activation for faces in the ventral visual pathway appears adult-like in adolescence, recognition abilities for individual faces are still immature. We investigated how the ability to represent individual faces and houses develops at the neural level. Category-selective regions of interest (ROIs) for faces in the fusiform gyrus (FG) and for places in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) were identified individually in children, adolescents, and adults. Then, using an functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation paradigm, we measured category selectivity and individual-level adaptation for faces and houses in each ROI. Only adults exhibited both category selectivity and individual-level adaptation bilaterally for faces in the FG and for houses in the PPA. Adolescents showed category selectivity bilaterally for faces in the FG and houses in the PPA. Despite this profile of category selectivity, adolescents only exhibited individual-level adaptation for houses bilaterally in the PPA and for faces in the left FG. Children only showed category-selective responses for houses in the PPA, and they failed to exhibit category-selective responses for faces in the FG and individual-level adaptation effects anywhere in the brain. These results indicate that category-level neural tuning develops prior to individual-level neural tuning and that face-related cortex is disproportionately slower in this developmental transition than is place-related cortex. © 2011 The Author.

AB  - The organization of category-selective regions in ventral visual cortex is well characterized in human adults. We investigated a crucial, previously unaddressed, question about how this organization emerges developmentally. We contrasted the developmental trajectories for face-, object-, and place-selective activation in the ventral visual cortex in children, adolescents, and adults. Although children demonstrated adult-like organization in object- and place-related cortex, as a group they failed to show consistent face-selective activation in classical face regions. The lack of a consistent neural signature for faces was attributable to (1) reduced face-selectivity and extent of activation within the regions that will become the FFA, OFA, and STS in adults, and (2) smaller volumes and considerable variability in the locus of face-selective activation in individual children. In contrast, adolescents showed an adult-like pattern of face-selective activation, although it was more right-lateralized. These findings reveal critical age-related differences in the emergence of category-specific functional organization in the visual cortex and support a model of brain development in which specialization emerges from interactions between experience-dependent learning and the maturing brain. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - The application of elaborative encoding strategies during learning, such as grouping items on similar semantic categories, increases the likelihood of later recall. Previous studies have suggested that stimuli that encourage semantic grouping strategies had modulating effects on specific ERP components. However, these studies did not differentiate between ERP activation patterns evoked by elaborative working memory strategies like semantic grouping and more simple strategies like rote rehearsal. Identification of neurocognitive correlates underlying successful use of elaborative strategies is important to understand better why certain populations, like children or elderly people, have problems applying such strategies. To compare ERP activation during the application of elaborative versus more simple strategies subjects had to encode either four semantically related or unrelated pictures by respectively applying a semantic category grouping or a simple rehearsal strategy. Another goal was to investigate if maintenance of semantically grouped vs. ungrouped pictures modulated ERP-slow waves differently. At the behavioral level there was only a semantic grouping benefit in terms of faster responding on correct rejections (i.e. when the memory probe stimulus was not part of the memory set). At the neural level, during encoding semantic grouping only had a modest specific modulatory effect on a fronto-central Late Positive Component (LPC), emerging around 650. ms. Other ERP components (i.e. P200, N400 and a second Late Positive Component) that had been earlier related to semantic grouping encoding processes now showed stronger modulation by rehearsal than by semantic grouping. During maintenance semantic grouping had specific modulatory effects on left and right frontal slow wave activity. These results stress the importance of careful control of strategy use when investigating the neural correlates of elaborative encoding. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Human Brain Mapping
AB  - Theoretical models for lexical access to visual objects have been based mainly on adult data. To investigate the developmental aspects of object recognition and lexical access in children, a large-scale functional MRI (fMRI) study was performed in 283 normal children ages 5-18 using a word-picture matching paradigm in which children would match an aurally presented noun to one of two pictures (line drawings). Using group Independent Component Analysis (ICA), six task-related components were detected, including (a) the posterior superior temporal gyrus bilaterally; (b) the fusiform, inferior temporal, and middle occipital gyri bilaterally; (c) the dorsal aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally, the left precuneus, the left superior/middle temporal gyrus, and the anterior cingulate; (d) the right medial fusiform gyrus; (e) a left-lateralized component including the inferior/middle frontal, middle temporal, medial frontal, and angular gyri, as well as the thalamus and the posterior cingulate; and (f) the ventral/anterior aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally. Increased activation associated with age was seen in the components (b) and (d) (ventral visual pathway) for object recognition, and (c) and (f) likely associated with semantic maintenance and response selection. Increased activation associated with task performance was seen in components (b) and (d) (ventral visual pathway) while decreased activation associated with task performance was seen in component (f) (ventral/anterior inferior frontal gyrus). The results corroborate the continued development of the ventral visual pathway throughout the developmental period. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a highly prevalent and specific disorder of reading acquisition characterised by impaired reading fluency and comprehension. We have previously identified fMRI- and ERP-based neural markers of impaired sentence reading in dyslexia that indicated both deviant basic word processing and deviant semantic incongruency processing. However, it remained unclear how specific these impairments are for dyslexia, as they occurred when children with dyslexia (DYS) were compared to chronological age-matched controls (CA) who also differ in the amount of reading experience. Adding a younger control group at a similar reading level (RL) as the dyslexic group, we examined here which of these markers would be specific for dyslexia despite matched performance, and which would resemble a developmental delay. Both the RL group and the DYS group showed a similar reversal of incongruency effects in the inferior parietal region (fMRI data) and similarly reduced incongruency effects around 400 ms (ERP data) compared to the CA group, suggesting that the semantic impairment in dyslexia resembles a developmental delay. Furthermore, the DYS group showed reduced sentence reading-related activation in the inferior parietal cortex in the fMRI data, and at around 100 ms (trend) and 400 ms in the ERP data when compared to both CA and RL groups, suggesting dyslexia-specific deficits in basic word processing during sentence reading. Low reading skills due to young age and due to dyslexia-specific word processing deficits thus reflect different pathways which impair semantic processing in similar ways. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Experience-dependent neural specialization during infancy
AU  - Scott, L.S.

T2  - Neuropsychologia
AB  - The ability to recognize the difference among faces of another race or species declines from 6 to 9 months of age. During this time, perceptual biases are formed, leading to lasting deficits in recognizing individuals of other races and species. However, little is known about how early infant experience shapes the neural structures underlying face processing. Here we found neural specialization, in infants who received 3 months of training with six individually labeled monkey faces. However, neural specialization was not found after an equal amount of training with the same six faces labeled at the category-level (i.e., all faces labeled " monkey") or when infants were exposed to faces without labels. These results suggest that neural specialization for faces requires learning at the individual level during infancy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Infants younger than 20 months of age interpret both words and symbolic gestures as object names. Later in development words and gestures take on divergent communicative functions. Here, we examined patterns of brain activity to words and gestures in typically developing infants at 18 and 26 months of age. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a match/mismatch task. At 18 months, an N400 mismatch effect was observed for pictures preceded by both words and gestures. At 26 months the N400 effect was limited to words. The results provide the first neurobiological evidence showing developmental changes in semantic processing of gestures. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested atypically enhanced activity of visual cortex during language processing in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, it remains unclear whether visual cortical participation reflects isolated processing within posterior regions or functional cooperation with distal brain regions, such as left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). We addressed this question using functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) and structural equation modeling in 14 adolescents and adults with ASD and 14 matched typically developing (TD) participants. Data were analyzed to isolate low-frequency intrinsic fluctuations, by regressing out effects of a semantic decision task. For a right extrastriate seed derived from the strongest cluster of atypical activation in the ASD group, widespread effects of increased connectivity in prefrontal and medial frontal lobes bilaterally were observed for the ASD group, compared to the TD group. A second analysis for a seed in LIFG, derived from pooled activation effects in both groups, also yielded widespread effects of overconnectivity in the ASD group, especially in temporal lobes. Structural equation modeling showed that whereas right extrastriate cortex did not impact function of language regions (left and right IFG, left middle temporal gyrus) in the TD model, it was an integral part of a language circuit in the ASD group. These results suggest that atypical extrastriate activation during language processing in ASD reflects integrative (not isolated) processing. Furthermore, our findings are inconsistent with previous reports of functional underconnectivity in ASD, probably related to removal of task effects required to isolate intrinsic low-frequency fluctuations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AU  - Shetreet, E.

T2  - Developmental psychology
AB  - Behavioral investigations of the acquisition of some have shown that children favor its logical interpretation (some and possibly all). Adults, however, use the pragmatic interpretation (some but not all) derived by a scalar implicature. Certain experimental manipulations increase children's rates of adult-like responses, indicating that children are capable of computing implicatures. A functional MRI (fMRI) study examining adults linked the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) to implicature computation, and prefrontal regions, the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and medial frontal gyrus (MeFG), to processing the mismatch between implicatures and the context in which they were presented. In the current fMRI study, we aimed to determine whether children's failure to give pragmatic interpretations to some results from a failure in implicature computation or in implicature-mismatch processing. We explored children's brain activations with the same experimental task administered to adults. In a region-of-interest analysis, children showed an activational pattern similar to the one observed in adults in the left IFG with increased activations for the implicature conditions. By contrast, in the left MFG, children showed decreased activation for the mismatched implicatures compared with matched and no implicature conditions. No difference between the conditions was observed in the MeFG. For both implicature conditions, no activation in the left IFG was observed when comparing adults and children directly. However, for mismatched implicatures, adults showed greater activation in the prefrontal regions compared with children. Our results suggest that children may have an adult-like computation of implicatures (even when their behavior does not necessarily indicate that), but they fail in resolving implicature-mismatch situations.

AB  - Behavioral studies have demonstrated that children develop a nearly adult-like grammar between 36 and 42 months, but few studies have addressed how the child's brain processes semantic versus syntactic information. In previous research, Silva-Pereyra and colleagues showed that distinct event-related potentials (ERPs) are elicited by semantic and syntactic violations in sentences in children as young as 30, 36, and 48 months, following the patterns displayed by adults. In the current study, we examined ERPs to syntactic phrase structure violations in real and jabberwocky sentences in 36-month-old children. Jabberwocky sentences are sentences in which content (open-class) words are replaced by pseudowords while function (closed-class) words are retained. Results showed that syntactically anomalous real sentences elicited two positive ERP effects: left-distributed effects from 500 to 750 msec and 1050 to 1300 msec, whereas syntactically anomalous jabberwocky sentences elicited two negative ERP effects: a left-distributed effect from 750 to 900 msec and a later broadly distributed effect from 950 to 1150 msec. The results indicate that when preschoolers process real English sentences, ERPs resembling the positive effects previously reported for adults are noted, although at longer latencies and with broader scalp distributions. However, when preschoolers process jabberwocky sentences with altered lexical-semantic content, a negative-going ERP component similar to one typically associated with the extraction of meaning is noted. © 2007 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is characterized by a severe reading problem in people who have normal intelligence and schooling. Impaired reading of alphabetic scripts is associated with dysfunction of left temporoparietal brain regions. These regions perform phonemic analysis and conversion of written symbols to phonological units of speech (grapheme–to–phoneme conversion); two central cognitive processes that mediate reading acquisition. Furthermore, it has been assumed that, in contrast to cultural diversities, dyslexia in different languages has a universal biological origin. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging with reading-impaired Chinese children and associated controls, that functional disruption of the left middle frontal gyrus is associated with impaired reading of the Chinese language (a logographic rather than alphabetic writing system). Reading impairment in Chinese is manifested by two deficits: one relating to the conversion of graphic form (orthography) to syllable, and the other concerning orthography–to–semantics mapping. Both of these processes are critically mediated by the left middle frontal gyrus, which functions as a centre for fluent Chinese reading that coordinates and integrates various information about written characters in verbal and spatial working memory. This finding provides an insight into the fundamental pathophysiology of dyslexia by suggesting that rather than having a universal origin, the biological abnormality of impaired reading is dependent on culture. © 2004 Nature publishing group.

AB  - An essential computational component of the human language faculty is syntax as it regulates how words are combined into sentences. Although its neuroanatomical basis is well-specified in adults, its emergence in the maturing brain is not yet understood. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a cross-sectional design, we discovered, that in contrast to what is known about adults 3-to-4- and 6-to-7-year-old children do not process syntax independently from semantics at the neural level already before these two types of information are integrated for the interpretation of a sentence. It is not until the end of the 10th year of life that children show a neural selectivity for syntax, segregated and gradually independent from semantics, in the left inferior frontal cortex as in the adult brain. Our results indicate that it takes until early adolescence for the domain-specific selectivity of syntax within the language network to develop. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Speech-associated gestures are hand and arm movements that not only convey semantic information to listeners but are themselves actions. Broca's area has been assumed to play an important role both in semantic retrieval or selection (as part of a language comprehension system) and in action recognition (as part of a "mirror" or "observation-execution matching" system). We asked whether the role that Broca's area plays in processing speech-associated gestures is consistent with the semantic retrieval/selection account (predicting relatively weak interactions between Broca's area and other cortical areas because the meaningful information that speech-associated gestures convey reduces semantic ambiguity and thus reduces the need for semantic retrieval/selection) or the action recognition account (predicting strong interactions between Broca's area and other cortical areas because speech-associated gestures are goal-direct actions that are "mirrored"). We compared the functional connectivity of Broca's area with other cortical areas when participants listened to stories while watching meaningful speech-associated gestures, speech-irrelevant self-grooming hand movements, or no hand movements. A network analysis of neuroimaging data showed that interactions involving Broca's area and other cortical areas were weakest when spoken language was accompanied by meaningful speech-associated gestures, and strongest when spoken language was accompanied by self-grooming hand movements or by no hand movements at all. Results are discussed with respect to the role that the human mirror system plays in processing speech-associated movements. © 2007.

AB  - The temporal lobes play a prominent role in declarative memory function, including episodic memory (memory for events) and semantic memory (memory for facts and concepts). Surgical resection for medication-resistant and well-localized temporal lobe epilepsy has good prognosis for seizure freedom, but is linked to memory difficulties in adults, especially when the removal is on the left side. Children may benefit most from surgery, because brain plasticity may facilitate post-surgical reorganization, and seizure cessation may promote cognitive development. However, the long-term impact of this intervention in children is not known. We examined memory function in 53 children (25 males, 28 females) who were evaluated for epilepsy surgery: 42 underwent unilateral temporal lobe resections (25 left, 17 right, mean age at surgery 13.8 years), 11 were treated only pharmacologically. Average follow-up was 9 years (range 5-15). Post-surgical change in visual and verbal episodic memory, and semantic memory at follow-up were examined. Pre- and post-surgical T1-weighted MRI brain scans were analysed to extract hippocampal and resection volumes, and evaluate post-surgical temporal lobe integrity. Language lateralization indices were derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging. There were no significant pre- to postoperative decrements in memory associated with surgery. In contrast, gains in verbal episodic memory were seen after right temporal lobe surgery, and visual episodic memory improved after left temporal lobe surgery, indicating a functional release in the unoperated temporal lobe after seizure reduction or cessation. Pre- to post-surgical change in memory function was not associated with any indices of brain structure derived from MRI. However, better verbal memory at follow-up was linked to greater post-surgical residual hippocampal volumes, most robustly in left surgical participants. Better semantic memory at follow-up was associated with smaller resection volumes and greater temporal pole integrity after left temporal surgery. Results were independent of post-surgical intellectual function and language lateralization. Our findings indicate post-surgical, hemisphere-dependent material-specific improvement in memory functions in the intact temporal lobe. However, outcome was linked to the anatomical integrity of the temporal lobe memory system, indicating that compensatory mechanisms are constrained by the amount of tissue which remains in the operated temporal lobe. Careful tailoring of resections for children undergoing epilepsy surgery may enhance long-term memory outcome. © The Author (2014).

AB  - Recent resting-state functional MRI investigations have demonstrated that much of the large-scale functional network architecture supporting motor, sensory and cognitive functions in older pediatric and adult populations is present in term- and prematurely-born infants. Application of new analytical approaches can help translate the improved understanding of early functional connectivity provided through these studies into predictive models of neurodevelopmental outcome. One approach to achieving this goal is multivariate pattern analysis, a machine-learning, pattern classification approach well-suited for high-dimensional neuroimaging data. It has previously been adapted to predict brain maturity in children and adolescents using structural and resting state-functional MRI data. In this study, we evaluated resting state-functional MRI data from 50 preterm-born infants (born at 23-29 weeks of gestation and without moderate-severe brain injury) scanned at term equivalent postmenstrual age compared with data from 50 term-born control infants studied within the first week of life. Using 214 regions of interest, binary support vector machines distinguished term from preterm infants with 84% accuracy (p < 0.0001). Inter- and intra-hemispheric connections throughout the brain were important for group categorization, indicating that widespread changes in the brain's functional network architecture associated with preterm birth are detectable by term equivalent age. Support vector regression enabled quantitative estimation of birth gestational age in single subjects using only term equivalent resting state-functional MRI data, indicating that the present approach is sensitive to the degree of disruption of brain development associated with preterm birth (using gestational age as a surrogate for the extent of disruption). This suggests that support vector regression may provide a means for predicting neurodevelopmental outcome in individual infants. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Some relationships between skills in word-category recall and factors in adults' aphasia
AU  - Sommers, R.K.
T2  - Perceptual and Motor Skills
AB  - It has long been recognized that a basic dimension to the lexical organization of the brain is semantic, and some brain mapping studies have indicated that the brain fields are distinctly different from some grammatical classes. Findings from the present investigation showed consistent relationships between 29 aphasic adults' performances on tasks involving graphic and gestural skills and those involving sequential recall of spoken words from different word categories. Each adult received the Porch Index of Communication Abilities which relies upon the physical manipulation of objects to assess verbal, gestural, and graphic abilities. Scores on a test requiring recall of word strings of nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, or prepositions were used to predict the subscale scores from the Graphic and Gestural factors of the index. Recall scores for verb and preposition were predictive of the aphasic subjects' performances on the Graphic subscale, and noun and preposition scores were predictors of subjects' scores on the Gestural subscale. The results are related to other research showing that verb and preposition skills are predictive of fine motor abilities of children with communication disorders and brain-mapping studies. Some discussion centers on possible overlapping functions of brain activity involving word categories, language, and fine motor skills.

T2  - Neuropsychologia
AB  - The phonological deficit hypothesis of dyslexia has been investigated in the present research by analysing language-related lateralization of the EEG theta band in a sample of dyslexic children. To this aim, a paradigm based on word-pair visual presentation was used in which the same words were processed in Semantic and Phonological tasks. Theta band amplitude, a cortical index that has been related to working memory processing, was analysed during four different phases of word elaboration, thus allowing to measure also the temporal dynamics of word reading/encoding in the verbal working memory. Control subjects showed a specific (and therefore efficient) task-related and time-dependent cortical activation: a peak of theta activity during word reading was found that decayed during the next inter stimulus interval. Furthermore, during word presentation in the Phonological task, theta amplitude was greater on the left hemisphere. Dyslexics evidenced an altered pattern of theta activation both in the temporal dimension and in the cortical space: their peak of activity was delayed to the first inter stimulus interval after word offset and was shifted to the right hemisphere throughout the whole epoch of Phonological task and in two phases of the Semantic task. Analysis of alpha band failed to replicate the complex pattern of lateralization found for theta band in the two groups, a result that suggests a specific functional role of theta band, which cannot be interpreted as a simple marker of cortical inhibition. Results point to a deficit, in dyslexic children, to recruit left hemisphere structures for the elaboration of the phonological component of the verbal working memory. This deficit was marked by a different, unspecific and dysfunctional hemispherical asymmetry of theta activation to language, a deficit that involved also the time course of phonological linguistic elaboration. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, we probed mother-child relationships with a computerized ball-toss game Cyberball. When excluded by one another, rather than by a stranger, both mothers and children exhibited a significantly pronounced frontal P2. Moreover, upon kin rejection versus stranger rejection, both mothers and children showed incremented left frontal positive slow waves for rejection events. Children reported more distress upon exclusion than their own mothers. Similar to past work, relatively augmented negative frontal slow wave activity predicted greater self-reported ostracism distress. This effect, generalized to the P2, was limited to mother- or child-rejection by kin, with comparable magnitude of effect across kin identity (mothers vs. children). For both mothers and children, the frontal P2 peak was significantly pronounced for kin rejection versus stranger rejection. Taken together, our results document the rapid categorization of social signals as kin relevant and the specificity of early and late neural markers for predicting felt ostracism. Kin rejection was examined by looking at neural responses in children and their mothers while playing the computer game Cyberball. Responses, specifically the frontal P2 and slow wave, were selectively greater for rejection by kin than by stranger. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the present voxel-based morphometry study was to examine the link between brain structure and number skills in a group of 6-7-year-old children born prematurely, which are considered to be an at-risk population for mathematical learning disabilities. Therefore, gray and white matter density values were extracted from brain areas previously reported to be relevant for number processing in developing brain systems and, thereafter, correlated with response time results tapping semantic number knowledge [i.e. numerical distance effect (NDE) derived from a number comparison task] as well as with general math proficiency (as indexed by a standardized calculation test). Behavioral results disclosed a significant NDE, thus indicating well-established number magnitude representations for one-digit numerals in our study group. Significant positive correlations between gray matter and NDE emerged in parietal regions (including the right anterior inferior and the left superior parietal lobe) and in the right superior temporal gyrus. Moreover, white matter and NDE were negatively correlated in the right anterior inferior parietal lobe and the right inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, our results are novel insofar as they show that in 6-7-year-old children born prematurely, individual differences in gray and white matter structures are associated with numerical skills. Importantly, in our study group the observed link between brain structure and behavioral performance emerges only regarding an experimental task tapping semantic number knowledge, whereas general math proficiency does not seem to be related to individual differences in brain structure in our study group. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether the four-factor category-based obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptom structure from a previous confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) may be appropriately used in child, adolescent, and adult groups. Symptom dimensions are increasingly used as quantitative traits in genetic, neuroimaging, and treatment studies of OCD across all ages. Identification of a category-based OCD symptom dimension structure that is validated for use across child, adolescent, and adult age groups is necessary to guide ongoing translational research. Method: Four OCD samples comprising 356 individuals were divided into child, adolescent, and adult groups. The fit of the only CFA-defined four-factor model was compared across these independent age group samples. Multiple-group CFA using maximum likelihood estimation assessed adequacy of fit comparing unconstrained and measurement weight-constrained models. The fit of previous exploratory factor analysis-defined three- and five-factor models on adults was also examined using CFA. Results: A four-factor solution provided adequate but imperfect fit across age groups, with comparable indices to the only previous OCD CFA: factor 1 (aggressive/sexual/religious/somatic/checking); factor 2 (symmetry/ordering/ counting/ repeating); factor 3 (contamination/cleaning), and factor 4 (hoarding). Models in which factor loadings were constrained and unconstrained across the three age groups yielded comparable model fit. Factors were highly correlated and were not mutually exclusive. The four-factor solution provided an improved fit to both three- and five-factor solutions using CFA across the three age groups. Conclusions: A four-factor, CFA-defined, category-based model of OCD symptom dimensions is adequate for use in children, adolescents, and adult age groups. The factor structure of this multiple age group sample has limitations and is imperfect, but current findings support the comparability of the defined latent OCD dimensions across age groups. Further work is needed to optimize a comprehensive symptom dimension model reflecting clinical heterogeneity for use in emergent translational studies. © 2008 by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

AB  - Objective: Language skills continue to develop rapidly in children during the school-age years, and the "snapshot" view of the neural substrates of language provided by current neuroimaging studies cannot capture the dynamic changes associated with brain development. The aim of this study was to conduct a 5-year longitudinal investigation of language development using functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy children. Methods: Thirty subjects enrolled at ages 5, 6, or 7 were examined annually for 5 years using a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner and a verb generation task. Data analysis was conducted based on a general linear model that was modified to investigate developmental changes whereas minimizing the potential for missing data. Results: With increasing age, there is progressive participation in language processing by the inferior/middle frontal, middle temporal, and angular gyri of the left hemisphere and the lingual and inferior temporal gyri of the right hemisphere and regression of participation of the left posterior insula/extrastriate cortex, left superior frontal and right anterior cingulate gyri, and left thalamus. Interpretation: The age-related changes observed in this study provide evidence of increased neuroplasticity of language in this age group and may have implications for further investigations of normal and aberrant language development. © 2006 American Neurological Association.

AB  - We investigated the effects of non-native language (English) exposure on event-related potentials (ERPs) in first- and second-year (four- and five-year-old) preschool Japanese native speakers while they listened to semantically congruent and incongruent Japanese sentences. The children were divided into a non-native language exposed group (exposed group) and a group without such experiences (control group) on the basis of their exposure to non-native language. We compared the ERPs recorded from the two groups in each of the two preschool years. N400 was observed both in the first- and second-year preschoolers. Differences owing to exposure to non-native language appeared in the second-year preschoolers but not in the first-year preschoolers. In the second-year preschoolers, the N400 onset in the exposed group was shorter than that in the control group, but there was no difference in the N400 offset between the exposed and control groups. Furthermore, the scalp distribution of the N400 in the exposed group was broader than that in the control group. These results indicate that the time course and scalp distribution of semantic processing for native language sentences in young children fluctuated depending on exposure to non-native language. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

AB  - Objective: Functional MRI was used to determine differences in patterns of cortical activation between children who suffered perinatal left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and healthy children performing a silent verb generation task. Methods: Ten children with prior perinatal left MCA stroke (age 6-16 years) and ten healthy age matched controls completed an executive language activation task. fMRI scans were acquired on a 3 T scanner using T2* weighted gradient echo, echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence. Random effects analysis and independent component analysis (ICA) were used to compute activation maps. Results: Both analysis methods demonstrated alternative activation of cortical areas in children with perinatal stroke. Following perinatal stroke, typical left dominant productive language areas in the inferior frontal gyrus were displaced to anatomical identical areas in the right hemisphere (p = .001). In addition, stroke patients showed more bilateral activation in superior temporal and anterior cingulate gyri and increased activation in primary visual cortex when compared to healthy controls. There was no relation between lesion size and the degree of right hemisphere activation. ICA showed that the healthy controls had a negative correlation with the time course in the right inferior frontal gyrus in the same region that was activated in stroke subjects. Interpretation: This functional MRI study in children revealed novel patterns of cortical language reorganization following perinatal stroke. The addition of ICA is complementary to Random Effects Analysis, allowing for the exploration of potential subtle differences in pathways in functional MRI data obtained from both healthy and pathological groups.

TI  - Electrophysiological studies of face processing in developmental prosopagnosia: Neuropsychological and neurodevelopmental perspectives
AU  - Towler, J.

T2  - Cognitive Neuropsychology
AB  - People with developmental prosopagnosia (DP) show severe face-recognition deficits that typically emerge during childhood without history of neurological damage. We review findings from recent event-related brain potential (ERP) studies of face perception and face recognition in DP. The generic face-sensitivity of the N170 component is present in most DPs, suggesting rapid category-selective streaming of facial information. In contrast, DPs show atypical N170 face inversion effects, indicative of impaired structural encoding, specifically for upright faces. In line with neurodevelopmental accounts of DP, these effects are similar to those observed for other developmental disorders, as well as for younger children and older adults. Identity-sensitive ERP components (N250, P600f) triggered during successful face recognition are similar for DPs and control participants, indicating that the same mechanisms are active in both groups. The presence of covert face-recognition effects for the N250 component suggests that visual face memory and semantic memory can become disconnected in some individuals with DP. The implications of these results for neuropsychological and neurodevelopmental perspectives on DP are discussed. © 2012, Copyright Psychology Press.

AB  - The complexities of pediatric brain imaging have precluded studies that trace the neural development of cognitive skills acquired during childhood. Using a task that isolates reading-related brain activity and minimizes confounding performance effects, we carried out a cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using subjects whose ages ranged from 6 to 22 years. We found that learning to read is associated with two patterns of change in brain activity: increased activity in left-hemisphere middle temporal and inferior frontal gyri and decreased activity in right inferotemporal cortical areas. Activity in the left-posterior superior temporal sulcus of the youngest readers was associated with the maturation of their phonological processing abilities. These findings inform current reading models and provide strong support for Orton's 1925 theory of reading development.

AB  - Behavioral evidence shows that sleep is crucial for the consolidation of declarative memories in children as in adults. However, the underlying cerebral mechanisms remain virtually unexplored. Using magnetoencephalography, we investigated in children (8.0-12.5 years) the impact of sleep (90-minute nap) on the neurophysiological processes underlying the creation and consolidation of novel associations between unknown objects and their functions. Learning-dependent changes in brain activity were observed within hippocampal and parahippocampal regions, followed by sleep-dependent changes in the prefrontal cortex, whereas no equivalent change was observed after a similar period of wakeful rest. Hence, our results show that in school-age children a 90-minute daytime nap after learning is sufficient to trigger the reorganization of memory-related brain activity toward prefrontal areas, where it incorporates into pre-existing semantic knowledge. This functional reorganization process in children is similar to that observed in adults but occurs at a much faster rate, which may contribute to the development of the impressive learning skills that characterize childhood. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In preterm children with very low birth weight (VLBW ≤ 1500 g), reading problems are often observed. Reading comprehension is dependent on word decoding and language comprehension. We investigated neural activation–within brain regions important for reading–related to components of reading comprehension in young VLBW adolescents in direct comparison to normal birth weight (NBW) term-born peers, with the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesized that the decoding mechanisms will be affected by VLBW, and expect to see increased neural activity for VLBW which may be modulated by task performance and cognitive ability. The study investigated 13 (11 included in fMRI) young adolescents (ages 12 to 14 years) born preterm with VLBW and in 13 NBW controls (ages 12–14 years) for performance on the Block Design and Vocabulary subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; and for semantic, orthographic, and phonological processing during an fMRI paradigm. The VLBW group showed increased phonological activation in left inferior frontal gyrus, decreased orthographic activation in right supramarginal gyrus, and decreased semantic activation in left inferior frontal gyrus. Block Design was related to altered right-hemispheric activation, and VLBW showed lower WISC Block Design scores. Left angular gyrus showed activation increase specific for VLBW with high accuracy on the semantic test. Young VLBW adolescents showed no accuracy and reaction time performance differences on our fMRI language tasks, but they did exhibit altered neural activation during these tasks. This altered activation for VLBW was observed as increased activation during phonological decoding, and as mainly decreased activation during orthographic and semantic processing. Correlations of neural activation with accuracy on the semantic fMRI task and with decreased WISC Block Design performance were specific for the VLBW group. Together, results suggest compensatory mechanisms by recruiting additional brain regions upon altered neural development of decoding for VLBW. © 2017 van Ettinger-Veenstra et al.

AB  - In children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, centrotemporal spikes may cause language dysfunction via disruption of underlying functional neuroanatomy. Fifteen patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and 15 healthy controls completed 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) language paradigms; standardized cognitive and language assessments were also performed. For all paradigms, children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes showed specific regional differences in activation compared to controls. Children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes also differed from controls on neuropsychological testing. They did not differ in general intelligence, but children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes scored significantly lower than controls on tests of language, visuomotor integration, and processing speed. These results extend previous findings of lower language and cognitive skills in patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and suggest epilepsy-related remodeling of language networks that may underlie these observed differences. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - Global anterograde amnesia is described in three patients with brain injuries that occurred in one case at birth, in another by age 4, and in the third at age 9. Magnetic resonance techniques revealed bilateral hippocampal pathology in all three cases. Remarkably, despite their pronounced amnesia for the episodes of everyday life, all three patients attended mainstream schools and attained levels of speech and language competence, literacy, and factual knowledge that are within the low average to average range. The findings provide support for the view that the episodic and semantic components of cognitive memory are partly dissociable, with only the episodic component being fully dependent on the hippocampus.

T2  - Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - The way the human brain constructs representations of numerical symbols is poorly understood. While increasing evidence from neuroimaging studies has indicated that the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) becomes increasingly specialized for symbolic numerical magnitude representation over developmental time, the extent to which these changes are associated with age-related differences in symbolic numerical magnitude representation or with developmental changes in non-numerical processes, such as response selection, remains to be uncovered. To address these outstanding questions we investigated developmental changes in the cortical representation of symbolic numerical magnitude in 6- to 14-year-old children using a passive functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation design, thereby mitigating the influence of response selection. A single-digit Arabic numeral was repeatedly presented on a computer screen and interspersed with the presentation of novel digits deviating as a function of numerical ratio (smaller/larger number). Results demonstrated a correlation between age and numerical ratio in the left IPS, suggesting an age-related increase in the extent to which numerical symbols are represented in the left IPS. Brain activation of the right IPS was modulated by numerical ratio but did not correlate with age, indicating hemispheric differences in IPS engagement during the development of symbolic numerical representation. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used extensively for functional neuroimaging over the past decade, in part because it is considered a powerful tool for investigating brain function in human infants and young children, for whom other neuroimaging techniques are not suitable. In particular, several studies have measured hemodynamic responses in the occipital region in infants upon exposure to visual stimuli. In the present study, we used a multi-channel NIRS to measure neuronal activity in a macaque monkey who was trained to watch videos showing various circus animals performing acrobatic activities without fixing the head position of the monkey. Cortical activity from the occipital region was measured first by placing a probe comprising a 3 × 5 array of emitters and detectors (2 × 4 cm) on the area (area 17), and the robustness and stability of the results were confirmed across sessions. Cortical responses were then measured from the dorsofrontal region. The oxygenated hemoglobin signals increased in area 9 and decreased in area 8b in response to viewing the videos. The results suggest that these regions are involved in cognitive processing of visually presented stimuli. The monkey showed positive responsiveness to the stimuli from the affective standpoint, but its attentional response to them was an inhibitory one. © 2010 Wakita, Shibasaki, Ishizuka, Schnackenberg, Fujiawara and Masataka.

AB  - Recent evidence demonstrates that a region of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) is selective to visually observed social interactions in adults. In contrast, little is known about neural responses to social interactions in children. Here, we used fMRI to ask whether the pSTS is ‘tuned’ to social interactions in children at all, and if so, how selectivity might differ from adults. This was investigated in the pSTS, along with several other socially-tuned regions in neighbouring temporal cortex: extrastriate body area, face selective STS, fusiform face area, and mentalizing selective temporo-parietal junction. Both children and adults showed selectivity to social interaction within right pSTS, while only adults showed selectivity on the left. Adults also showed both more focal and greater selectivity than children (6–12 years) bilaterally. Exploratory sub-group analyses showed that younger children (6–8), but not older children (9–12), are less selective than adults on the right, while there was a continuous developmental trend (adults > older > younger) in left pSTS. These results suggest that, over development, the neural response to social interactions is characterized by increasingly more selective, focal, and bilateral pSTS responses, a process that likely continues into adolescence. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to compare volume- and boundary-based morphometry methods by applying them in the statistical analysis of 2-D shapes. The methods discussed in the first category include voxel-, deformation-, and tensor-based morphometry. The active shape model is demonstrated as an example of the second category of methods. The test data are 2-D shapes of the corpus callosum (CC) obtained in patients with left-thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), as well as age and sex matched healthy participants. The features of both categories of methods and the complementarily of them are demonstrated, which may provide guidelines for their applications in medical-image analysis. The morphometric abnormality in the splenium of the CC cross-validated by different methods has potential value in the prognosis and curve prediction of the left-thoracic AIS. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Previous studies have found specialized syntactic and semantic processes in the adult brain during language comprehension. Young children have sophisticated semantic and syntactic aspects of language, yet many previous fMRI studies failed to detect this specialization, possibly due to experimental design and analytical methods. In this current study, 5-to 6-year-old children completed a syntactic task and a semantic task to dissociate these two processes. Multivoxel pattern analysis was used to examine the correlation of patterns within a task (between runs) or across tasks. We found that the left middle temporal gyrus showed more similar patterns within the semantic task compared with across tasks, whereas there was no difference in the correlation within the syntactic task compared with across tasks, suggesting its specialization in semantic processing. Moreover, the left superior temporal gyrus showed more similar patterns within both the semantic task and the syntactic task as compared with across tasks, suggesting its role in integration of semantic and syntactic information. In contrast to the temporal lobe, we did not find specialization or integration effects in either the opercular or triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, our study showed that 5-to 6-year-old children have already developed specialization and integration in the temporal lobe, but not in the frontal lobe, consistent with developmental neurocognitive models of language comprehension in typically developing young children. © 2019 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Poor readers perform worse than their normal reading peers on a variety of speech perception tasks, which may be linked to their phonological processing abilities. The purpose of the study was to compare the brain activation patterns of normal and impaired readers on speech perception to better understand the phonological basis in reading disability. Whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded as good and poor readers, 7-13 years of age, performed an auditory word discrimination task. We used an auditory oddball paradigm in which the 'deviant' stimuli (/bat/, /kat/, /rat/) differed in the degree of phonological contrast (one versus three features) from a repeated standard word (/pat/). Both good and poor readers responded more slowly to deviants that were phonologically similar compared to deviants that were phonologically dissimilar to the standard word. Source analysis of the MEG data using minimum norm estimation (MNE) showed that compared to good readers, poor readers had reduced left-hemisphere activation to the most demanding phonological condition reflecting their difficulties with phonological processing. Furthermore, unlike good readers, poor readers did not show differences in activation as a function of the degree of phonological contrast. These results are consistent with a phonological account of reading disability. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) reveal dysfunction in the neural systems mediating object processing (particularly faces) and social cognition, but few investigations have systematically assessed the specificity of the dysfunction. We compared cortical responses in typically developing adolescents and those with ASD to stimuli from distinct conceptual domains known to elicit category-related activity in separate neural systems. In Experiment 1, subjects made category decisions to photographs, videos, and point-light displays of people and tools. In Experiment 2, subjects interpreted displays of simple, geometric shapes in motion depicting social or mechanical interactions. In both experiments, we found a selective deficit in the ASD subjects for dynamic social stimuli (videos and point-light displays of people, moving geometric shapes), but not static images, in the functionally localized lateral region of the right fusiform gyrus, including the fusiform face area. In contrast, no group differences were found in response to either static images or dynamic stimuli in other brain regions associated with face and social processing (e.g. posterior superior temporal sulcus, amygdala), suggesting disordered connectivity between these regions and the fusiform gyrus in ASD. This possibility was confirmed by functional connectivity analysis. © The Author 2012.

T2  - Human Brain Mapping
AB  - This study aimed to examine early specialization of brain regions for phonological and semantic processing of spoken language in young children. Thirty-five typically developing children aged from 5 to 6 years performed auditory phonological (same sound judgment) and semantic (related meaning judgment) word-level tasks. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined specialization within the language network, by conducting three levels of analysis. First, we directly compared activation between tasks and found a greater sound judgment as compared to meaning judgment activation in left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and supramarginal gyrus. In contrast, greater meaning judgment as compared to sound judgment task activation was found in left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Second, we examined the brain-behavior correlations and found that phonological skill was correlated with the task difference in activation in left superior temporal sulcus, whereas semantic skill was correlated with the task difference in activation in left MTG. Third, we compared between two experimental conditions within each task and found a parametric effect in left STG for the sound judgment task, and a parametric effect in left MTG for the meaning judgment task. The results of this study indicate that, by the age of 5–6 years, typically developing children already show some specialization of temporo-parietal brain regions for phonological and semantic processes. However, there were no task differences in the left inferior frontal gyrus suggesting that the frontal cortex may not yet be specialized in this age range, which is consistent with the delayed maturation of the frontal cortex. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Several small patient studies and case reports raise concerns that the reliability of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be impaired in the vicinity of cerebral lesions. This could affect the clinical validity of fMRI for presurgical language lateralization. The current study sets out to identify if a systematic effect of lesion type and localization on fMRI exists. Methods: We classify lesions typically occurring in epilepsy patients according to (1) their potential to disturb blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-effect generation or detection or to disturb spatial brain normalization, and (2) the proximity of lesions to protocol-specific volumes of interest (VOIs). The effect of lesions is evaluated through the examination of 238 epilepsy patients and a subgroup of 37 patients with suspected unilateral left-language dominance according to the Wada test. Results: Patients with fMRI-critical lesions such as cavernomas, gliomas, and mass defects close to VOIs, or with severe atrophy, show lower lateralization indices (LIs) and more often discordant language lateralization with the Wada test than do patients without such lesions. Discussion: This study points seriously toward fMRI-language lateralization being sensitive to cerebral lesions. Some lesion types and locations are more critical than others. Our results question the noncritical application of fMRI in patients with cerebral lesions. © 2009 International League Against Epilepsy.

AB  - Analogical reasoning, or the ability to find correspondences between entities based on shared relationships, supports knowledge acquisition. As such, the development of this ability during childhood is thought to promote learning. Here, we sought to better understand the mechanisms by which analogical reasoning about semantic relations improves over childhood and adolescence (e.g. chalk is to chalkboard as pen is to…?). We hypothesized that age-related differences would manifest as differences in the brain regions associated with one or more of the following cognitive functions: (1) controlled semantic retrieval, or the ability to retrieve task-relevant semantic associations; (2) response control, or the ability to override the tendency to respond to a salient distractor; and/or (3) relational integration, or the ability to consider jointly two mental relations. In order to test these hypotheses, we analyzed patterns of fMRI activation during performance of a pictorial propositional analogy task across 95 typically developing children between the ages of 6 and 18 years old. Despite large age-related differences in task performance, particularly over ages 6–10 but through to around age 14, participants across the whole age range recruited a common network of frontal, parietal and temporal regions. However, activation in a brain region that has been implicated in controlled semantic retrieval – left anterior prefrontal cortex (BA 47/45) – was positively correlated with age, and also with performance after controlling for age. This finding indicates that improved performance over middle childhood and early adolescence on this analogical reasoning task is driven largely by improvements in the ability to selectively retrieve task-relevant semantic relationships. © 2017 The Authors.

T2  - Brain and Language
AB  - Instead of assessing activation in distinct brain regions, approaches to investigating the networks underlying distinct brain functions have come into the focus of neuroscience research. Here, we provide a completely data-driven framework for assessing functional and causal connectivity in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, employing Granger's causality. We investigate the networks underlying story processing in 17 healthy children (8f, 9m, 10.4 ± 2.8 years, 6.5-15.4 years). Extensive functional connectivity exists between brain regions, including some not detected in standard random effects analyses. Causal connectivity analyses demonstrate a clear dominance of left-sided language regions for both forward and backward interactions with other network nodes. We believe our approach to be useful in helping to assess language networks in the normal or pathological setting; it may also aid in providing better starting estimates for the more hypothesis-driven approaches like structural equation or dynamic causal modeling. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Sentence comprehension requires the integration of both syntactic and semantic information, the acquisition of which seems to have different trajectories in the developing brain. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the neural correlates underlying syntactic and semantic processing during auditory sentence comprehension as well as its development in preschool children by manipulating case marking and animacy hierarchy cues, respectively. A functional segregation was observed within Broca's area in the left inferior frontal gyrus for adults, where the pars opercularis was involved in syntactic processing and the pars triangularis in semantic processing. By contrast, five-year-old children sensitive to animacy hierarchy cues showed diffuse activation for semantic processing in the left inferior frontal and posterior temporal cortices. While no main effect of case marking was found in the left fronto-temporal language network, children with better syntactic skills showed greater neural responses for syntactically complex sentences, most prominently in the posterior superior temporal cortex. The current study provides both behavioral and neural evidence that five-year-old children compared to adults rely more on semantic information than on syntactic cues during sentence comprehension, but with the development of syntactic abilities, their brain activation in the left fronto-temporal network increases for syntactic processing. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - A growing body of neuroimaging evidence has shown that Chinese character processing recruits differential activation from alphabetic languages due to its unique linguistic features. As more investigations on Chinese character processing have recently become available, we applied a meta-analytic approach to summarize previous findings and examined the neural networks for orthographic, phonological, and semantic processing of Chinese characters independently. The activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method was used to analyze eight studies in the orthographic task category, eleven in the phonological and fifteen in the semantic task categories. Converging activation among three language-processing components was found in the left middle frontal gyrus, the left superior parietal lobule and the left mid-fusiform gyrus, suggesting a common sub-network underlying the character recognition process regardless of the task nature. With increasing task demands, the left inferior parietal lobule and the right superior temporal gyrus were specialized for phonological processing, while the left middle temporal gyrus was involved in semantic processing. Functional dissociation was identified in the left inferior frontal gyrus, with the posterior dorsal part for phonological processing and the anterior ventral part for semantic processing. Moreover, bilateral involvement of the ventral occipito-temporal regions was found for both phonological and semantic processing. The results provide better understanding of the neural networks underlying Chinese orthographic, phonological, and semantic processing, and consolidate the findings of additional recruitment of the left middle frontal gyrus and the right fusiform gyrus for Chinese character processing as compared with the universal language network that has been based on alphabetic languages. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The development of language comprehension abilities in childhood is closely related to the maturation of the brain, especially the ability to process syntactically complex sentences. Recent studies proposed that the fronto-temporal connection within left perisylvian regions, supporting the processing of syntactically complex sentences, is still immature at preschool age. In the current study, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from typically developing 5-year-old children and adults to shed further light on the brain functional development. Children additionally performed a behavioral syntactic comprehension test outside the scanner. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations was analyzed in order to identify the functional correlation networks of language-relevant brain regions. Results showed an intrahemispheric correlation between left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in adults, whereas an interhemispheric correlation between left IFG and its right-hemispheric homolog was predominant in children. Correlation analysis between resting-state functional connectivity and sentence processing performance in 5-year-olds revealed that local connectivity within the left IFG is associated with competence of processing syntactically simple canonical sentences, while long-range connectivity between IFG and pSTS in left hemisphere is associated with competence of processing syntactically relatively more complex non-canonical sentences. The present developmental data suggest that a selective left fronto-temporal connectivity network for processing complex syntax is already in functional connection at the age of 5 years when measured in a non-task situation. The correlational findings provide new insight into the relationship between intrinsic functional connectivity and syntactic language abilities in preschool children. © 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Frontal lobe dysfunction underlies the differential word retrieval impairment in adolescents with high-functioning autism

T2  - Autism Research
AB  - There is substantial evidence of word retrieval impairment as indicated by poor performance on the category fluency test in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this impairment. Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that the lateral frontal cortex plays a key role in flexible word retrieval. Thus, we examined whether individuals with ASD exhibited altered frontal processing during the category fluency test using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-two adolescents with high-functioning ASD (20 males) and 22 typically developing (TD) adolescents (16 males) aged 11–18 years were recruited. All underwent a category fluency paradigm, which required production of animal or means of transportation words for 1 min each although their frontal hemodynamic changes were recorded with fNIRS. We found that adolescents with ASD produced fewer animal but not transportation words (group-by-category interaction: P = 0.003), suggesting differential word retrieval impairment. In addition, unlike TD adolescents who exhibited activation primarily in lateral frontal regions during word production, adolescents with ASD had comparable activation across lateral and medial frontal regions. More importantly, this lack of lateral–medial distinction of activation, which was associated with poor word retrieval, differed significantly between groups only in the animal category (group-by-category interaction: P = 0.018). Thus, our findings implicate frontal lobe dysfunction in the impairment of differential word retrieval in adolescents with ASD. The relatively greater involvement of the medial frontopolar cortex might reflect the use of nonspecialized brain regions to compensate for the category-dependent difficulties with word retrieval in ASD. Autism Res 2019, 12: 600–613. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary: Using an optical imaging tool, we found that adolescents with autism had difficulties with producing semantically related words and exhibited frontal lobe dysfunction. Nonetheless, poor word production and altered brain processing was only seen when these adolescents were asked to produce words from a category of living things but not nonliving things (i.e., animals but not means of transportation). Category-dependent word retrieval problems and frontal lobe dysfunction might be two features of this disorder. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Our aim was to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms recruited by adolescents with Asperger Disorder (AD), in comparison to controls, and to detect the underlying mechanisms during the complex information processing required for the performance of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Male adolescents (n = 23; mean age 15.1 ± 3.6 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of AD were compared with a normal male control group with similar demographic characteristics (n = 43; mean age: 15.1 ± 3.6 years). A computerized neurocognitive battery was administered and included: Inspection Time (IT), Finger Tapping Test (FTT), Simple Reaction Time (SRT), Choice Reaction Time (CRT), Digit Running task (DRT), Stroop test and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Adolescents with AD performed significantly worse than controls on the DSST. This impaired DSST performance was related to cognitive mechanisms different from those employed by normal controls. Motor slowness and inability to deal with increased amounts of information affected the performance of the AD group, while shifting of attention was the limiting factor in the controls. Both groups were similarly dependent on response selection. This study demonstrated differences in performance in complex cognitive tasks between adolescents with AD and normal controls that may be related to differences in neurocognitive mechanisms underlying information processing. Future neuroimaging studies are needed to clarify the neural network involved in the differences in cognitive performance between AD subjects and normal controls. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Dishabituation of the BOLD response to speech sounds
AU  - Zevin, J.D.

T2  - Behavioral and Brain Functions
AB  - Background: Neural systems show habituation responses at multiple levels, including relatively abstract language categories. Dishabituation - responses to non-habituated stimuli - can provide a window into the structure of these categories, without requiring an overt task. Methods: We used an event-related fMR1 design with short interval habituation trials, in which trains of stimuli were presented passively during 1.5 second intervals of relative silence between clustered scans. Trains of four identical stimuli (standard trials) and trains of three identical stimuli followed by a stimulus from a different phonetic category (deviant trials) were presented. This paradigm allowed us to measure and compare the time course of overall responses to speech, and responses to phonetic change. Results: Comparisons between responses to speech and silence revealed strong responses throughout the extent of superior temporal gyrus (STG) bilaterally. Comparisons between deviant and standard trials revealed dishabituation responses in a restricted region of left posterior STG, near the border with supramarginal gyrus (SMG). Novelty responses to deviant trials were also observed in right frontal regions and hippocampus. Conclusion: A passive, dishabituation paradigm provides results similar to studies requiring overt responses. This paradigm can readily be extended for the study of pre-attentive processing of speech in populations such as children and second-language learners whose overt behavior is often difficult to interpret because of ancillary task demands. © 2005 Zevin and McCandliss; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The neural systems for phonological processing of written language have been well identified now, while models based on these neural systems are different for different language systems or age groups. Although each of such models is mostly concordant across different experiments, the results are sensitive to the experiment design and intersubject variability. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis can quantitatively synthesize the data from multiple studies and minimize the interstudy or intersubject differences. In this study, we performed two ALE meta-analysis experiments: one was to examine the neural activation patterns of the phonological processing of two different types of written languages and the other was to examine the development characteristics of such neural activation patterns based on both alphabetic language and logographic language data. The results of our first meta-analysis experiment were consistent with the meta-analysis which was based on the studies published before 2005. And there were new findings in our second meta-analysis experiment, where both adults and children groups showed great activation in the left frontal lobe, the left superior/middle temporal gyrus, and the bilateral middle/superior occipital gyrus. However, the activation of the left middle/inferior frontal gyrus was found increase with the development, and the activation was found decrease in the following areas: the right claustrum and inferior frontal gyrus, the left inferior/medial frontal gyrus, the left middle/superior temporal gyrus, the right cerebellum, and the bilateral fusiform gyrus. It seems that adults involve more phonological areas, whereas children involve more orthographic areas and semantic areas. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Forming intentions successfully: Differential compensational mechanisms of adolescents and old adults
AU  - Zöllig, J.
AU  - Martin, M.
AU  - Kliegel, M.
T2  - Cortex
AB  - Introduction: Forming an intention is a key aspect of prospective memory, i.e., the ability to encode, retain, and later realize an intention with a delay of minutes, hours or days. Behavioural and neurophysiological findings from both prospective and retrospective memory research suggest that the efficiency of encoding processes is reduced at both ends of the lifespan and that neural generators underlying successful encoding might differ in childhood and old age. Hence, the present study investigates compensational neural mechanisms during the encoding of intentions in adolescents and old adults compared to young adults. Methods: We compared Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) and their source localization in 14 adolescents (11-13 years), 14 young adults (18-25 years), and 14 old adults (64-79 years) in a prospective memory task that was embedded in a semantic categorization task. Results: Our data revealed three event-related modulations that differentiate between conditions (i.e., ongoing activity and successful intention formation trials) and groups. Source localizations of these modulations with standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) revealed compensational activations in adolescents and old adults compared to young adults in successful intention formation trials: while adolescents showed a higher activation of secondary occipital regions in the time window of 500-1200. msec with a maximum around 800. msec, old adults activated prefrontal regions to a greater extent beginning at 700. msec, persisting until 1200. msec and expanding to middle temporal regions. Conclusion: For a successful encoding of intentions adolescents and old adults recruit more neural generators than young adults. More importantly, the pattern of these compensational activations is different when comparing adolescents with young adults and old adults with young adults. These differences are discussed with regard to differential maturational changes in the brain. © 2009 Elsevier Srl.

AB  - Overview: Behavioural data reveal an inverted U-shaped function in the efficiency of prospective memory from childhood to young adulthood to later adulthood. However, prior research has not directly compared processes contributing to age-related variation in prospective memory across the lifespan, hence it is unclear whether the same factors explain the 'rise and fall' of prospective remembering from childhood to later adulthood. The present study examined this question using a paradigm that allowed us to consider the behavioural and neural correlates of processes associated with the prospective and retrospective components of prospective memory. Methods: We compared 14 adolescents, 14 young adults, and 14 old adults in a paradigm where the prospective memory task was embedded in a semantic categorization task. Results: The behavioural data revealed an inverted U-shaped function with adolescents and old adults performing poorly relative to young adults. Analyses of the error data revealed that different processes may have contributed to failures of prospective memory in adolescents and older adults. This finding was supported by age differences in ERP-components for cue detection and post-retrieval processes. Additionally, source localization using LORETA revealed different patterns of neural recruitment for adolescents and older adults relative to younger adults. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that adolescents and older adults show different patterns of behavioural errors and neural recruitment for successful prospective remembering indicating that different processes may contribute to the 'rise and fall' of prospective memory across the lifespan. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Semantic language skills are an integral part of early childhood language development. The semantic association between verbs and nouns constitutes an important building block for the construction of sentences. In this large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, involving 336 subjects between the ages of 5 and 18 years, we investigated the neural correlates of covert verb generation in children. Using group independent component analysis (ICA), seven task-related components were identified including the mid-superior temporal gyrus, the most posterior aspect of the superior temporal gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the angular gyrus, and medial aspect of the parietal lobule (precuneus/posterior cingulate). A highly left-lateralized component was found including the medial temporal gyrus, the frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the angular gyrus. The associated independent component (IC) time courses were analyzed to investigate developmental changes in the neural elements supporting covert verb generation. Observed age effects may either reflect specific local neuroplastic changes in the neural substrates supporting language or a more global transformation of neuroplasticity in the developing brain. The results are analyzed and presented in the framework of two theoretical models for neurocognitive brain development. In this context, group ICA of fMRI data from our large sample of children aged 5–18 years provides strong evidence in support of the regionally weighted model for cognitive neurodevelopment of language networks.

AB  - The prevalence, age of onset, and symptomatology of many neuropsychiatric conditions differ between males and females. To understand the causes and consequences of sex differences it is important to establish where they occur in the human brain. We report the first meta-analysis of typical sex differences on global brain volume, a descriptive account of the breakdown of studies of each compartmental volume by six age categories, and whole-brain voxel-wise meta-analyses on brain volume and density. Gaussian-process regression coordinate-based meta-analysis was used to examine sex differences in voxel-based regional volume and density. On average, males have larger total brain volumes than females. Examination of the breakdown of studies providing total volumes by age categories indicated a bias towards the 18–59 year-old category. Regional sex differences in volume and tissue density include the amygdala, hippocampus and insula, areas known to be implicated in sex-biased neuropsychiatric conditions. Together, these results suggest candidate regions for investigating the asymmetric effect that sex has on the developing brain, and for understanding sex-biased neurological and psychiatric conditions.

TI  - A novel gaze based measure of receptive vocabulary and category knowledge in toddlers at a heightened familial risk for autism spectrum disorder
AU  - Hauschild, Kathryn M.
AB  - Toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have language, social, and/or communicative deficits (i.e. gaze aversion and reduced understanding of or engagement in gesturing) that become confounds when completing standardized assessments of receptive language. Thus, assessments that rely on parent report or direct interaction with a test administrator may not fully capture the abilities and underlying knowledge of these children. Visual attention based measures of receptive language reduce task demands placed on participants and have been shown to produce a more accurate measure of receptive vocabulary than parent report measures. However, current gaze-based measures employ a visual paired comparison method. When there are only two items, the similarity of the target to the distractor can have a significant impact on the interpretation of task performance. The current study evaluates the feasibility of expanding these looking paradigms to include an eight-item array. This Visual Array Task (VAT) combines the theoretical framework of the Intermodal Preferential Looking Paradigm and Looking-While-Listening methods of receptive language with the sequential touching paradigm of object categorization. The use of a larger array of items and the inclusion of a superordinate category contrast could provide a more sensitive measure of receptive language as well as a better understanding of the extent to which early word comprehension reflects knowledge of broader categories. Results indicate that the tested VAT was both a sensitive measure of receptive vocabulary as well as capable of reflecting gains in category knowledge. This paradigm provides researchers with an inexpensive and efficient task to measure receptive language as well as other general constructs such as category knowledge while reducing behavioral demands placed on the participant. Data here validate the feasibly of using the task to measure receptive vocabulary and category knowledge in children at genetic risk for ASD. Without modification, the VAT can accommodate the testing of minimally verbal to non-verbal populations, as well as populations, such as children with anxiety, that may encounter many of the interaction-based hurdles similar to children with ASD. Thus, the VAT is measure that can be administered uniformly across a broad spectrum of populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Developmental Science
AB  - The development of language indicating the emergence of thinking about the thoughts of self and others has been scarcely studied in Spanish-speaking children. For this reason, we studied the development of mental state language and various indicators of language development in 25 Spanish-speaking children assessed at 3, 3 1/2, 4, 4 1/2, and 5 years of age. We coded and categorized the 40,250 utterances children produced during the five time points, 1202 (3.01%) of which had mental terms. In this sample, mental state language in Spanish children developed with a similar timeline and patterns as described in English-speaking children. However, several findings were novel for studies of mental state language. The general indexes of syntactic development did not correlate with the production of mental terms. The Index of Lexical Diversity was associated with the frequency of references to verbs of desire. The results of regression analyses suggest that not only the development of subordinate sentences with complement is associated with genuine mental references to desires and beliefs, but the development of lexical skills as well.

AB  - Depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder are linked to altered limbic morphology, dysregulated neuroendocrine function, and heightened amygdala responses to salient social cues. Oxytocin appears to be a potent modulator of amygdala reactivity and neuroendocrine responses to psychosocial stress. Given these stress regulatory effects, there is increasing interest in understanding the role of oxytocin in vulnerability to stress-related clinical disorders. The present study examines the impact of a common functional variant within the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene (rs2254298) on structure and function of the amygdala in a high-risk sample of urban, low-income, minority youth with a high incidence of early life stress (ELS). Compared to G/G homozygotes, youth carrying the OXTR A-allele showed increased amygdala volume, reduced behavioral performance, and heightened amygdala response during two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks that involved viewing socially-relevant face stimuli. Higher amygdala response was related to ELS in A-allele carriers but not G/G homozygotes. These findings underscore a series of relations among a common oxytocin system gene variant, ELS exposure, and structure and function of the amygdala in early life. Heightened amygdala response to salient social cues in OXTR A-allele carriers may elevate risk for emotional psychopathology by increasing amygdala involvement in disambiguating environmental cues, particularly for individuals with ELS.

T2  - Brain Research
AB  - Studies of first (L1) and second (L2) language representation in the brain have not identified the timing and locations of neural regions involved in L1 and L2 processing. Magnetoencephalography offers high spatial and temporal resolution and can be employed to disentangle subtle timing and neural control differences between L1 and L2 use. We tested bilingual adults in the MEG as they completed a picture verb generation task in L1 and L2. We found the expected progression of activation from occipital to temporal to inferior frontal areas. We also observed the following differences. A sustained insula and early cingulate event-related desynchrony was observed only with L2; the fMRI literature suggests that the former reflects an activation, and the latter an inhibition, sub-process for language selection. L2 processes exhibited a lag and were bilateral compared to L1 processes. Finally, L1 and L2 activated adjacent language control in dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex.

TI  - Assessment of the semantic knowledge network in older adults with familial history of alzheimer's disease
AU  - Holcomb, Erin Marie
AB  - Current techniques for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease rely on early implementation, which necessitates the need for accurate and early identification of individuals most at risk for future cognitive decline. Research has demonstrated the usefulness of examining the temporal gradient for long-term semantic knowledge in identification of such individuals. The assessment of the temporal gradient within varying levels of knowledge specificity, however, has received considerably less attention. In this study, we aimed to contrast accuracy and reaction times for semantic memory tasks tapping multiple dimensions of semantic specificity from multiple time epochs in adult children with and without a parental history of AD. Two supplementary aims involved: 1) examination of the integrative effects of age of memory (i.e., the temporal gradient) and specificity of information on the organization of famous person knowledge in older adults and 2) whether these effects could also be used to understand the organizational structure of conceptual word knowledge. While no group differences were observed on our novel tasks, we believe that understanding task performance at this stage is of benefit for future studies. The potential use of similar tasks in neuroimaging studies is discussed within the context of literature documenting the utility of brain activation patterns during semantic memory tasks. Finally, behavioral performance on our tasks indicates that both the age of memory and specificity of knowledge are influential in the organization of semantic networks for person knowledge. Performance on conceptual word knowledge tasks, however, does not produce a similar temporal gradient for long-term memory. We believe that this is due to the integration of episodic/autobiographical networks during recall of person knowledge. Theoretical implications of these findings for understanding the encoding and consolidation processes of long-term memory circuits and hippocampal involvement in semantic memory formation are discussed.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset, impairing, disorder and a diagnostic category that is grouped as a neurodevelopmental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a complex disorder influenced by the interplay of multiple risk factors. Although there is a strong genetic contribution, non-inherited factors are also important. Children with ADHD can underperform on IQ tests. They also show deficits on measures of executive function, response inhibition, prefrontal cortical function, delay aversion and timing deficits. Structural imaging studies show alterations, including reduced volume, in the basal ganglia and limbic regions of the brain, and delayed cortical maturation especially in the prefrontal regions; functional magnetic resonance imaging studies implicate corticostriatal circuit involvement and alterations in networks considered relevant to attention and executive function. Physical examination needs to include checks on weight, height and the cardiovascular system, especially if medication is later prescribed as part of the treatment plan and the child has intellectual disability. Symptoms of ADHD decline with age, but longitudinal studies show that ADHD and/or additional problems tend to persist into adolescence and adult life.

AB  - In recent years an increasing number of studies focus on the issue of early diagnosis and intervention. At the same time, a large number of special service units for early psychosis have been established around the world especially in Australia, USA, UK, Germany etc. Recently, similar units operate in Greece also. The Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association in its latest edition in 2013 (DSM-5), introduced the category 'Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome' (APS) for people with early psychotic experiences in the section: 'Conditions for further study'. This new category has specific criteria and describes a situation. In which a person displays psychotic symptoms in an attenuated form, with quite unaffected reality testing, but not qualifying a diagnosis of schizophrenic spectrum. The clinical expression of APS should be differentiated with several well known psychiatric disorders such as: brief psychotic disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, major depression with psychotic features, adolescence adjustment disorders, drug use, etc. The 'Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome' occurs mainly in adolescence and in young adulthood. The mean percentage of transition to psychosis for these individuals is estimated at 36%, three years after the onset of initial symptoms, while the risk of transition to psychosis, although smaller, seems to remain up to ten years later. For some other individuals, transition to other psychiatric disorders occurs, such as depression with psychotic elements, or bipolar disorder, while a significant number of them will not transmit to even more serious disorders. At the biological level, studies focused in brain's neuroimaging, suggest significant volumetric differences among people at high risk for psychosis who later develop psychosis compared to those who don't, while studies of psychophysiological indicators or/and genetic markers show promising results for the identification of relevant parameters indicating the transition to psychosis. Although an heterogeneous population, people with APS, show significant difficulties in social, professional and cognitive level, that should be therapeutically addressed. In an attempt to improve the clinical status of these individuals, to delay or even to prevent a psychotic episode, a series of Interventions have been used by psychiatrists. These interventions include: (a) administration of drugs, especially atypical antipsychotics or antidepressants in low dosage, (b) administration of non-pharmaceutical supplements (e.g. omega-3 ), (c) psychotherapeutic interventions, mainly cognitive behavior therapy and (d) a combination of the above. Many questions need to be answered such as, the period of therapeutic intervention, identification of indicators (biological or/and clinical) that may determine the most suited for the APS individuals therapeutic interventions or, that may foresee, to prevent the transition to psychosis. Thus, the continuation of research in populations of APS individuals in multiple levels is necessary. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: We investigated the relationship between partial epilepsy, MRI findings, and atypical language representation. Methods: A total of 102 patients (4 to 55 years) with left hemisphere epileptogenic zones were evaluated using three fMRI language tasks obtained at 1.5 or 3T with EPI BOLD techniques: verbal fluency, reading comprehension, and auditory comprehension. fMRI maps were visually interpreted at a standard threshold and rated as left or atypical language. Results: Atypical language dominance occurred in 30 patients (29%) and varied with MRI type (p < 0.01). Atypical language representation occurred in 36% (13/36) with normal MRI, 21% (6/29) with mesial temporal sclerosis, 14% (4/28) with focal cortical lesions (dysplasia, tumor, vascular malformation), and all (6/6) with a history of stroke. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found handedness, seizure onset, and MRI type accounted for much of the variance in language activation patterns (χ² = 24.09, p < 0.01). Atypical language was more prevalent in patients with early seizure onset (43.2%, p < 0.05) and atypical handedness (60%, p < 0.01). None of the three clinical factors were correlated with each other (p > 0.40). Patients with atypical language had lower verbal abilities (F = 6.96, p = 0.01) and a trend toward lower nonverbal abilities (F = 3.58, p = 0.06). There were no differences in rates of atypical language across time, age groups, or MRI scanner. Conclusion: Early seizure onset and atypical handedness, as well as the location and nature of pathologic substrate, are important factors in language reorganization.

AB  - Early multisensory perceptual experiences shape the abilities of infants to perform sociallyrelevant visual categorization, such as the extraction of gender, age, and emotion from faces. Here, we investigated whether multisensory perception of gender is influenced by infant-directed (IDS) or adult-directed (ADS) speech. Six-, 9-, and 12-month-old infants saw side-by-side silent video-clips of talking faces (a male and a female) and heard either a soundtrack of a female or a male voice telling a story in IDS or ADS. Infants participated in only one condition, either IDS or ADS. Consistent with earlier work, infants displayed advantages in matching female relative to male faces and voices. Moreover, the new finding that emerged in the current study was that extraction of gender from face and voice was stronger at 6 months with ADS than with IDS, whereas at 9 and 12 months, matching did not differ for IDS versus ADS. The results indicate that the ability to perceive gender in audiovisual speech is influenced by speech manner. Our data suggest that infants may extract multisensory gender information developmentally earlier when looking at adults engaged in conversation with other adults (i.e., ADS) than when adults are directly talking to them (i.e., IDS). Overall, our findings imply that the circumstances of social interaction may shape early multisensory abilities to perceive gender. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We examined autobiographical memory performance in two patients with semantic dementia using a novel measure, the Autobiographical Interview [Levine, Svoboda, Hay, Winocur, & Moscovitch (2002). Aging and autobiographical memory: Dissociating episodic from semantic retrieval. Psychology and Aging, 17,677-689], that is capable of dissociating episodic and personal semantic recall under varying levels of retrieval support. Earlier reports indicated that patients with semantic dementia demonstrate autobiographical episodic memory loss following a 'reverse gradient' by which recent memories are preserved relative to remote memories. We found limited evidence for this pattern at conditions of low retrieval support. When structured probing was provided, patients' autobiographical memory performance was similar to that of controls. Retesting of one patient after 1 year indicated that retrieval support was insufficient to bolster performance following progressive prefrontal volume loss, as documented with quantified structural neuroimaging. These findings are discussed in relation to theories of limbic-neocortical interaction in autobiographical memory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Bilingual and monolingual brains compared: A fMRI study of semantic processing
AU  - Kovelman, Ioulia
AB  - Does early and sustained experience with two languages in childhood modify how language is processed in the adult bilingual brain? Does extensive exposure to two languages influence language processing in the bilingual brain as compared to monolinguals? The present study investigated how adult bilinguals process semantic information, both in speech and in print, across varying language contexts or modes (bilingual modes and monolingual modes). Using behavioral and neuroimaging (fMRI) measurements, two hypotheses were tested, the Neurological Signature Hypothesis and the Functional Switching Hypothesis. The Neurological Signature Hypothesis predicts that early highly proficient bilinguals will recruit neurological tissue to process language differently from monolinguals; hence, such differences may constitute a 'neurological signature' of bilingualism and should be present across all language contexts. The Functional Switching Hypothesis predicts that bilinguals will recruit neurological tissue to process language similarly to monolinguals, but not across all contexts/modes. Early-exposed highly proficient Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals (N=27) completed a Semantic Judgment (lexico-semantic level), a Passage Comprehension (sentences) and a non-linguistic Stimulus-Response Compatibility attention task in the fMRI scanner. During the Semantic Judgment task bilinguals were presented with words in Spanish and in English, one language at a time (monolingual mode), and in rapid alternation (bilingual mode). Monolinguals completed each language task in English only. Our results supported the Neurological Signature Hypothesis. When presented with one language at a time, bilinguals demonstrated greater recruitment of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) than monolinguals. When presented with two languages in rapid alternation, bilinguals demonstrated a more robust recruitment of right DLPFC and right inferior frontal cortex. During non-linguistic attentional tasks bilinguals showed higher behavioral accuracy during control and incongruous trials, but not during switch trials, as compared to monolinguals, and bilinguals also had an overall more robust recruitment of the left inferior parietal cortex. These findings elucidate how extensive early bilingual exposure modifies language organization in the brain, as well as how this change impacts other domains of cognition. This research further identifies the benefits of early and extensive bilingual education, including high dual language proficiency, skilled dual language literacy, and enhancement of general cognitive capabilities.

AB  - When manic-depressive psychosis was originally defined in DSM-I and DSM-II, confusion arose because patients who had only depressive episodes (now called unipolar) were included in this category. Since DSM-III reorganized the definition of mood disorders, bipolar was meant to clarify course (someone with bipolar disorder presumably had at least one lifetime manic episode). However, being 'bipolar' has come to be synonymous with 'manic,' and, ironically, it is difficult to know whether a patient who has bipolar disorder is having his or her lifetime characterized (i.e., no current problem but history of mania) or a current state identified and if that current state is a manic, depressive, hypomaniac, or depressed episode. This chapter mainly concerns itself with mania in youths. Definitional problems, epidemiology, comorbidity, and obstetrical complications as a risk factor for bipolar disorders are discussed. Additionally, neuroimaging studies comparing bipolar and nonbipolar children, phenomenology and differential diagnosis, and family studies are examined. Finally, assessment, treatment, and follow-up are addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a naturalistic joint attention scenario to evaluate two, alternative hypotheses concerning the social brain. The first, Content Specific Attribution hypothesis, was that core regions previously identified as being involved in social cognition also participate in representing the contents of another mind. The second, Dual Role hypothesis, was that extrastriate, category-specific visual regions respond to a visible stimulus of a specific category and to the same stimulus occluded, but when it appears to be the focus of another person's visual attention. Participants viewed category-specific stimuli (Place and Body images) to localize the extrastriate body area (EBA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA). Then, they observed a computerized character viewing each stimulus category, occluded from the participant's view. In support of the Content Specific Attribution hypothesis, whole-brain analyses revealed that viewing someone else looking at an occluded picture of a body activated brain regions previously associated with components of social cognition more than viewing someone else looking at an occluded picture of a place. Counter to the Dual Role hypothesis, functional region of interest (ROI) analyses revealed that the EBA and PPA were not clearly involved in representing what the character was seeing.

AU  - Leibenluft, Ellen
T2  - JAMA Psychiatry
AB  - In this issue of JAMA Psychiatry, Bebko et al. (see record [rid]2014-09588-011[/rid]) present an innovative multisite study that uses both categorical and dimensional approaches to test associations between brain activity and symptoms in youth with severe emotional and behavioral dysregulation. Most fMRI studies compare patients with a specific categorical DSM-IV diagnosis with healthy individuals. Post hoc analyses may examine associations between dimensional severity measures of the illness and brain activity or test the contribution of comorbid DSM-IV illnesses to the primary findings. In contrast, Bebko et al. focused on a group of children who are of interest precisely because, although their clinical presentation is both common and very impairing, their symptoms defy attempts to fit them neatly into one diagnostic category. Psychopathology presents in complex ways, particularly in children, and defining the relevant unit of analysis is challenging for clinicians and researchers. The work of Bebko et al provides proof of the principle that research designed to map brain mechanisms on to behavior in seriously ill children can benefit from adopting a dimensional perspective.

TI  - Children's use of mutual exclusivity to learn labels for parts of objects
AU  - Hansen, Mikkel B.
AU  - Markman, Ellen M.
T2  - Developmental Psychology
AB  - When teaching children part terms, adults frequently outline the relevant part rather than simply point. This pragmatic information very likely helps children interpret the label correctly. But the importance of gestures may not negate the need for default lexical biases such as the whole object assumption and mutual exclusivity. On this view, children initially assume that a novel label refers to a whole object. If the label for the object is familiar, mutual exclusivity blocks this assumption and frees children to look for a part referent. In this study, the authors taught children part terms by outlining a novel part of a real object. We made mutual exclusivity available by showing children familiar whole objects with novel parts and unavailable by showing unfamiliar whole objects with novel parts. During test, the object was oriented with the part facing away from the child to distinguish pointing to the object from pointing to the part. Both 2-year-olds and 3-year-olds learned more part labels when mutual exclusivity was available. Thus, mutual exclusivity is indispensable even when part labeling is accompanied by naturalistic communicative gestures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Describes an analysis of lexical processing performed in a 66-yr-old male patient with the acute onset of an isolated anomia. Based on a model of lexical processing, hypotheses were evaluated as to the source of the naming deficit. Impairments were observed in oral and written picture naming and oral naming to definition with relatively intact semantic processing across input modalities, suggesting that output from the semantic system was impaired. In contrast with previous reports, the authors propose that this pattern represents an impairment that arises late in semantic processing prior to accessing mode-specific verbal and graphemic output lexicons. These deficits were associated with a lesion in the posterior portion of the middle temporal gyrus or area 37, an area of supramodal association cortex that is uniquely suited as a substrate for the multimodal deficit in naming.

T2  - Developmental Science
AB  - Skilled reading depends on recognizing words efficiently in isolation (word‐level processing; WL) and extracting meaning from text (discourse‐level processing; DL); deficiencies in either result in poor reading. FMRI has revealed consistent overlapping networks in word and passage reading, as well as unique regions for DL processing; however, less is known about how WL and DL processes interact. Here we examined functional connectivity from seed regions derived from where BOLD signal overlapped during word and passage reading in 38 adolescents ranging in reading ability, hypothesizing that even though certain regions support word‐ and higher‐level language, connectivity patterns from overlapping regions would be task modulated. Results indeed revealed that the left‐lateralized semantic and working memory (WM) seed regions showed task‐dependent functional connectivity patterns: during DL processes, semantic and WM nodes all correlated with the left angular gyrus, a region implicated in semantic memory/coherence building. In contrast, during WL, these nodes coordinated with a traditional WL area (left occipitotemporal region). In addition, these WL and DL findings were modulated by decoding and comprehension abilities, respectively, with poorer abilities correlating with decreased connectivity. Findings indicate that key regions may uniquely contribute to multiple levels of reading; we speculate that these connectivity patterns may be especially salient for reading outcomes and intervention response.

T2  - The Cerebellum
AB  - In less than three decades, the concept 'cerebellar neurocognition' has evolved from a mere afterthought to an entirely new and multifaceted area of neuroscientific research. A close interplay between three main strands of contemporary neuroscience induced a substantial modification of the traditional view of the cerebellum as a mere coordinator of autonomic and somatic motor functions. Indeed, the wealth of current evidence derived from detailed neuroanatomical investigations, functional neuroimaging studies with healthy subjects and patients and in-depth neuropsychological assessment of patients with cerebellar disorders shows that the cerebellum has a cardinal role to play in affective regulation, cognitive processing, and linguistic function. Although considerable progress has been made in models of cerebellar function, controversy remains regarding the exact role of the 'linguistic cerebellum' in a broad variety of nonmotor language processes. This consensus paper brings together a range of different viewpoints and opinions regarding the contribution of the cerebellum to language function. Recent developments and insights in the nonmotor modulatory role of the cerebellum in language and some related disorders will be discussed. The role of the cerebellum in speech and language perception, in motor speech planning including apraxia of speech, in verbal working memory, in phonological and semantic verbal fluency, in syntax processing, in the dynamics of language production, in reading and in writing will be addressed. In addition, the functional topography of the linguistic cerebellum and the contribution of the deep nuclei to linguistic function will be briefly discussed. As such, a framework for debate and discussion will be offered in this consensus paper. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cortical auditory categorization was assessed in 2-month-old infants at genetic risk for dyslexia and controls. Manipulated /bAk/ and /dAk/ speech stimuli were used as frequently presented standards. The neuroelectric brain responses of the control infants were highly sensitive to the phoneme boundary that separated these stimuli, but the infants at risk showed no signs of cortical categorical perception. Cortical sources of the responses were predominantly found in the left hemisphere for the control infants, but mainly in the right hemisphere for the infants at risk. The results demonstrate that impaired categorical perception in dyslexia is already present in infants at risk for the disorder. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Data-driven approaches can capture behavioral and biological variation currently unaccounted for by contemporary diagnostic categories, thereby enhancing the ability of neurobiological studies to characterize brain-behavior relationships. Methods: A community-ascertained sample of individuals (N = 347, 18–59 years of age) completed a battery of behavioral measures, psychiatric assessment, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a cross-sectional design. Bootstrap-based exploratory factor analysis was applied to 49 phenotypic subscales from 10 measures. Hybrid hierarchical clustering was applied to resultant factor scores to identify nested groups. Adjacent groups were compared via independent samples t tests and chi-square tests of factor scores, syndrome scores, and psychiatric prevalence. Multivariate distance matrix regression examined functional connectome differences between adjacent groups. Results: Reduction yielded six factors, which explained 77.8% and 65.4% of the variance in exploratory and constrained exploratory models, respectively. Hybrid hierarchical clustering of these six factors identified two, four, and eight nested groups (i.e., phenotypic communities). At the highest clustering level, the algorithm differentiated functionally adaptive and maladaptive groups. At the middle clustering level, groups were separated by problem type (maladaptive groups; internalizing vs. externalizing problems) and behavioral type (adaptive groups; sensation-seeking vs. extraverted/emotionally stable). Unique phenotypic profiles were also evident at the lowest clustering level. Group comparisons exhibited significant differences in intrinsic functional connectivity at the highest clustering level in somatomotor, thalamic, basal ganglia, and limbic networks. Conclusions: Data-driven approaches for identifying homogenous subgroups, spanning typical function to dysfunction, not only yielded clinically meaningful groups, but also captured behavioral and neurobiological variation among healthy individuals.

T2  - Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience
AB  - Understanding the intended meaning of a remark beyond what is explicitly stated is an integral part of successful social interactions. Here, we examined the neural circuitry underlying the interpretation of communicative intent in children and adults using irony comprehension as a test case. Participants viewed cartoon drawings while listening to short scenarios ending with a potentially ironic remark and were asked to decide whether the speaker was being sincere or ironic. In both children and adults, instructions to attend to the cues provided by the speaker's facial expression or tone of voice modulated the activity in visual and language cortices, respectively. Overall, children engaged the medial prefrontal cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus more strongly than adults, whereas adults recruited the fusiform gyrus, extrastriate areas and the amygdala more strongly than children. Greater involvement of prefrontal regions in children may subserve the integration of multiple cues to reconcile the discrepancy between the literal and intended meaning of an ironic remark. This developmental shift from a reliance on frontal regions to posterior occipitotemporal regions may reflect the automatization of basic reasoning about mental states. This study is the first to examine developmental changes In the neural circuitry underlying natural language pragmatics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Subtle disorders of neuronal migration occur in the brains of some dyslexic patients who present developmental language disorder (DLD) during early childhood. This study investigated a possible neuroanatomical substrate based on neuroimaging evaluation in children with DLD. The authors obtained psychological assessment, language evaluation, neurologic examination, and neuroimaging investigation for 15 children who met inclusion and exclusion criteria (at least 4 yrs old, a primary complaint of language delay, normal hearing, IQ >70, no severe motor or cognitive handicap). The Ss were 4-14 yrs old. Six patients presented diffuse polymicrogyria (PMG) around the entire extent of the sylvian fissure on MRI. They had severe clinical manifestation of DLD: they did not speak at all or had mixed phonologic-syntactic deficit syndrome. Six Ss presented PMG restricted to the posterior aspects of the parietal regions, and they had a milder form of DLD, mainly phonologic programing deficit syndrome. It is concluded that DLD can be associated with polymicrogyria and that clinical manifestation varies according to the extension of cortical abnormality. A subtle form of posterior parietal polymicrogyria presenting as developmental language disorder is a mild form of perisylvian syndrome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults is associated with deficits in executive functions such as verbal fluency. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy offers the possibility to measure brain activity during verbal fluency in psychiatric patients due to low susceptibility to movements artefacts. Fourteen patients with mainly combined ADHD subtype and 14 healthy controls matched for age, gender, handedness, education level, and intelligence showed equal performance in phonological verbal fluency and higher performance in semantical verbal fluency in comparison to the controls. On the level of brain function indicated by concentration changes of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin, both groups showed inferior frontal brain activity during both tasks. ADHD patients had a lower magnitude of oxygenation and a significant negative correlation of brain activity with performance, i.e. higher brain activity was associated with lower performance. These results might be interpreted as a lack of disease related deficits, as an economical recruitment of cognitive resources, or--more likely--as an expression of a benefit in the patient group. High verbal competence in our samples could contribute to these findings. One speculative and post hoc explanation aims at the clinically well-known phenomenon of hyperfocusing in patients with ADHD.

AB  - During word and object recognition, extensive activation has consistently been observed in the left ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOT), focused around the occipito-temporal sulcus (OTs). Previous studies have shown that there is a hierarchy of responses from posterior to anterior vOT regions (along the y-axis) that corresponds with increasing levels of recognition—from perceptual to semantic processing, respectively. In contrast, the functional differences between superior and inferior vOT responses (i.e. along the z-axis) have not yet been elucidated. To investigate, we conducted an extensive review of the literature and found that peak activation for reading varies by more than 1 cm in the z-axis. In addition, we investigated functional differences between superior and inferior parts of left vOT by analysing functional MRI data from 58 neurologically normal skilled readers performing 8 different visual processing tasks. We found that group activation in superior vOT was significantly more sensitive than inferior vOT to the type of task, with more superior vOT activation when participants were matching visual stimuli for their semantic or perceptual content than producing speech to the same stimuli. This functional difference along the z-axis was compared to existing boundaries between cytoarchitectonic areas around the OTs. In addition, using dynamic causal modelling, we show that connectivity from superior vOT to anterior vOT increased with semantic content during matching tasks but not during speaking tasks whereas connectivity from inferior vOT to anterior vOT was sensitive to semantic content for matching and speaking tasks. The finding of a functional dissociation between superior and inferior parts of vOT has implications for predicting deficits and response to rehabilitation for patients with partial damage to vOT following stroke or neurosurgery.

T2  - Brain Imaging and Behavior
AB  - Schizophrenia has a strong genetic component that is relevant to the understanding of the pathophysiology of the syndrome. Thus, recent investigations have shifted from studies of diagnosed patients with schizophrenia to examining their unaffected relatives. Previous studies found that during language processing, relatives thought to be at genetic high-risk for the disorder exhibit aberrant functional activation in regions of language processing, specifically in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area). However, functional connectivity among the regions involved in language pathways is not well understood. In this study, we examined the functional connectivity between a seed located in Broca’s area and the remainder of the brain during a visual lexical decision task, in 20 schizophrenia patients, 21 subjects at genetic high risk for the disorder and 21 healthy controls. Both the high-risk subjects and patients showed significantly reduced activation correlations between seed and regions related to visual language processing. Compared to the high-risk subjects, the schizophrenia patients showed even fewer regions that were correlated with the seed regions. These results suggest that there is aberrant functional connectivity within cortical language circuitry in high-risk subjects and patients with schizophrenia. Broca’s area, which is one of the important regions for language processing in healthy controls, had a significantly reduced role in the high-risk subjects and patients with schizophrenia. Our findings are consistent with the existence of an underlying biological disturbance that begins in genetically at risk individuals and progresses to a greater extent in those who eventually develop schizophrenia.

AB  - This fourth issue of 2013 covers research on the categorization of psychiatric diseases as well as latest results on biological treatment options of impulse control disorders and their brain structural and functional underpinnings. Launching the first thematic focus of this issue, Steinberg and Himmerich aimed to reconstruct Emil Kraepelin's habilitation process back in the early 1880s, in which first attempts to categorize organic psychiatric disorders following acute inflammatory diseases were made. Returning to the present, Zilles and colleagues set out to further clarify the diagnostic specificity of working memory deficits in the context of the Kraepelinian dichotomization of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Casas and colleagues introduce the second thematic focus of this issue with a placebo-controlled study on treatment effects of OROS methylphenidate in adult attention deficit hyperactivity. Rösler and colleagues, who report correlations of improvements in ADHD symptoms with better daily functioning and health-related quality of life under treatment with OROS methylphenidate in adult ADHD. Surman and colleagues investigated effects of glutamate modulation on adult ADHD by memantine monotherapy. Kamphausen and colleagues explored the fronto-limbic neural circuitry in borderline personality disorder ( BPD ) by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Finally, Huyser and colleagues switch the focus to the impact of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

AB  - Previous neuroimaging studies in adults have revealed that first and second languages (L1/L2) share similar neural substrates, and that proficiency is a major determinant of the neural organization of L2 in the lexical‐semantic and syntactic domains. However, little is known about neural substrates of children in the phonological domain, or about sex differences. Here, we conducted a large‐scale study (n = 484) of school‐aged children using functional near‐infrared spectroscopy and a word repetition task, which requires a great extent of phonological processing. We investigated cortical activation during word processing, emphasizing sex differences, to clarify similarities and differences between L1 and L2, and proficiency‐related differences during early L2 learning. L1 and L2 shared similar neural substrates with decreased activation in L2 compared to L1 in the posterior superior/middle temporal and angular/supramarginal gyri for both sexes. Significant sex differences were found in cortical activation within language areas during high‐frequency word but not during low‐frequency word processing. During high‐frequency word processing, widely distributed areas including the angular/supramarginal gyri were activated in boys, while more restricted areas, excluding the angular/supramarginal gyri were activated in girls. Significant sex differences were also found in L2 proficiency‐related activation: activation significantly increased with proficiency in boys, whereas no proficiency‐related differences were found in girls. Importantly, cortical sex differences emerged with proficiency. Based on previous research, the present results indicate that sex differences are acquired or enlarged during language development through different cognitive strategies between sexes, possibly reflecting their different memory functions.

AB  - There is comparatively little information about premorbid maturational brain abnormalities in schizophrenia (SCZ). We investigated whether a history of childhood enuresis, a well-established marker of neurodevelopmental delay, is associated with SCZ and with measures of brain abnormalities also associated with SCZ. A Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) based history of enuresis, volumetric brain MRI scans and neuropsychological testing were obtained in patients with SCZ, their non-psychotic siblings (SIB) and non-psychiatric controls (NC). The subjects were 211 patients (79.6% male), 234 of their SIB (43.2% male) and 355 controls (39.2% male). Frequency of enuresis was compared across groups and correlated with cognitive measures. Total and regional brain volumes were determined using voxel-based morphometry on matched subsets of probands (n = 82) with or without enuresis (n = 16, n = 66, respectively) and controls (n = 102) with or without enuresis (n = 11, n = 91, respectively). Patients with SCZ had higher rates of childhood enuresis (21%) compared with SIB (11%; χ² = 6.42, P = 0.01) or controls (7%; χ² = 23.65, P < 0.0001) and relative risk for enuresis was increased in SIB (λs = 2.62). Patients with enuresis performed worse on two frontal lobe cognitive tests [Letter Fluency (t = 1.97, P = 0.05, df = 200) and Category Fluency (t = 2.15, P = 0.03, df = 200)] as compared with non-enuretic patients. Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed grey matter volume reductions in several frontal regions (right BA 9, right BA 10 and bilateral BA 45) and right superior parietal cortex (BA 7) in patients with a history of enuresis as compared with non-enuretic patients (all t > 3.57, all P < 0.001). The high frequency of childhood enuresis associated with SCZ and abnormalities in prefrontal function and structure in patients with a childhood history of enuresis suggest that childhood enuresis may be a premorbid marker for neurodevelopmental abnormalities related to SCZ. These findings add to the evidence implicating prefrontal dysmaturation in this disorder, potentially related to genetic risk factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reports an error in 'A typical participation of visual cortex during word processing in autism: An fMRI study of semantic decision' by Michael S. Gaffrey, Natalia M. Kleinhans, Frank Haist, Natacha Akshoomoff, Ashley Campbell, Eric Courchesne and Ralph-Axel Müller (Neuropsychologia, 2007, Vol 45[8], 1672-1684). In the article, the title was represented incorrectly as 'A typical participation of visual cortex during word processing in autism: An fMRI study of semantic decision'. It is represented correctly in the erratum, beginning with the word 'Atypical'. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2007-04246-009[/rid].) Language delay and impairment are salient features of autism. More specifically, there is evidence of atypical semantic organization in autism, but the functional brain correlates are not well understood. The current study used functional MRI to examine activation associated with semantic category decision. Ten high-functioning men with autism spectrum disorder and 10 healthy control subjects matched for gender, handedness, age, and nonverbal IQ were studied. Participants indicated via button press response whether visually presented words belonged to a target category (tools, colors, feelings). The control condition required target letter detection in unpronounceable letter strings. Significant activation for semantic decision in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 44 and 45) was found in the control group. Corresponding activation in the autism group was more limited, with smaller clusters in left inferior frontal areas 45 and 47. Autistic participants, however, showed significantly greater activation compared to controls in extrastriate visual cortex bilaterally (areas 18 and 19), which correlated with greater number of errors on the semantic task. Our findings suggest an important role of perceptual components (possibly visual imagery) during semantic decision, consistent with previous evidence of atypical lexicosemantic performance in autism. In the context of similar findings from younger typically developing children, our results suggest an immature pattern associated with inefficient processing, presumably due to atypical experiential embedding of word acquisition in autism.

AB  - The growing numbers of innovative, nonpharmacological treatments developed for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in recent years reflect an emerging synergy between basic and applied science, and symbolizes how they reciprocally inform and advance the field. This chapter examines executive function training, one category of these emerging treatment interventions that has garnered widespread interest among clinicians, mental health professionals, and parents of children with ADHD. We summarize the accumulating evidence from neuroimaging studies initially to provide fundamental insights into why children with ADHD continue to experience significant impairment across a wide range of functional outcomes despite receiving the most efficacious treatments available over an extended time period. The ensuing section highlights the evolving literature on executive functions (EFs) and the extent to which particular EFs and/or their component processes are deficient and related to cote clinical features (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity) and functional outcomes in children with ADHD. Afterward, we describe two broad categories of EF training programs, facilitative intervention training (FIT) and mindfulness. We focus on these two particular training programs because they share two common tenets: (1) that many of these children's behavioral, cognitive, interpersonal, and learning difficulties are outcomes of underdeveloped or poorly regulated EF processes, and (2) that these EF processes can be strengthened or corrected through training and extended practice. In the final section, we summarize extant evidence supporting FIT and mindfulness interventions. We also discuss what we believe represents the most critical issues that must be resolved to enable these types of interventions to bring about fundamental and lasting changes in the cognitive abilities and associated functional outcomes in children with ADHD.

AB  - Choosing the correct response from a subset of alternatives is a fundamental problem and particularly demanding where conflicting response tendencies are evident. One phenomenon in this context is the congruency sequence-(Gratton effect), for which different theoretical explanations have been put forward. A critical aspect that differs between these explanations is the expectancy of what will happen in forthcoming trials. In the current study we examine the relevance of expectancy for sequence congruency effects and related neurophysiological processes using a flanker task in which we manipulate the probability that the n +1 trial presents the same stimulus–response mapping than the n trial. We ask what cognitive subprocesses involved in response selection may be modulated by expectancy effects. To distinguish different subprocesses probably modulated by expectancy effects we use event-related potentials (ERPs) in combination with source localization techniques. The data show that cognitive subprocesses modulated by expectancy depend on the nature of expected transitions between succeeding trials. Expectancy effects only affected trial transitions within the same category (i.e., ‘compatible-compatible’ and ‘incompatible-incompatible’), but not between compatibility categories (i.e., ‘compatible-incompatible’ and ‘incompatible-compatible’). On compatible trial transitions attentional selection processes operating via the precuneus mediated expectancy effects, while on incompatible trial transitions inhibitory processes were modulated that were mediated via the medial and middle frontal gyrus, the orbitofrontal cortex, the insular and the parahippocampal gyrus. Conflict monitoring processes per se were not modulated by expectancy effects. The data shows that there are different subprocesses underlying the influence of expectancy on sequence effects during response selection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Experience-based changes in cortical responses to written words
AU  - Mccandliss, Bruce Donald
AB  - Reading is a learned skill of obvious importance to society. Our ability to recognize written words has been investigated extensively through cognitive and neuroimaging studies. Such research has identified distinct brain regions related to processing the orthography of visual words and accessing the information associated with particular words. This thesis uses high density event related potential recordings (ERP) and reaction time methods to examine the acquisition of word reading abilities in adults and children. The first study used these methods to trace learning-related changes as undergraduates spent 50 hours learning a miniature artificial language (Keki). Keki words are somewhat irregular by the standards of English orthography, but possess English-like semantics. Behavioral measures indicate that learning Keki produced similar reaction time benefits shown for English words. Early portions of the ERP (around 200 msec) were sensitive to orthographic differences between English, Keki and consonant strings, but these effects were uninfluenced by learning Keki. Learning effects in later portions of the ERP related to semantic processing (around 300 msec) demonstrate that Keki words came to be processed much like English. A second study examined ten year old children reading English words. Behavioral responses demonstrated an influence of word familiarity and a smaller influence of orthographic regularity. Early portions of the ERP were influenced by familiarity, but orthographic influences on the ERP were much later than for the adults and showed a different topography. A third study with seven year olds showed no initial ERP influences due to the familiarity or the orthography of English words. Several hours spent learning new words via phonics or look-say instruction produced learning effects for trained words in reaction time measures and in later portions of the ERP, but these effects were not equivalent for the two instruction methods. Overall, these studies show the possibility of using ERPs to explore the details of the acquisition of word reading skills. For both adults and children, hours spent learning new words has a substantial impact on reaction times and ERPs, yet acquisition of the adult pattern of orthographic processing apparently requires extensive reading experience. This dissertation includes previously unpublished co-authored materials. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Familiarity modulates the functional relationship between theory of mind and autobiographical memory
AU  - Rabin, Jennifer S.
AU  - Rosenbaum, R. Shayna
T2  - NeuroImage
AB  - Qualitative and quantitative reviews of the neuroimaging literature show that overlapping brain regions support theory of mind (ToM) and autobiographical memory (AM). This overlap has been taken to suggest that individuals draw on past personal experiences to infer others’ mental states, but work with amnesic people shows that ToM does not always depend on AM. One variable that may determine the extent to which one relies on AM when inferring another's thoughts and feelings during ToM is whether that individual is personally known. To test this possibility, participants were scanned with fMRI as they remembered past experiences in response to personal photos (‘AM’ condition) and imagined others’ experiences in response to photos of personally familiar (‘pToM’ condition) and unfamiliar (‘ToM’ condition) others. Spatiotemporal Partial Least Squares was used to identify the spatial and temporal characteristics of neural activation patterns associated with AM, pToM, and ToM. We found that the brain regions supporting pToM more closely resembled those supporting AM relative to ToM involving unfamiliar others, with the greatest degree of overlap within midline regions. A complementary finding was the observation of striking differences between pToM and ToM such that midline regions associated with AM predominated during pToM, whereas more lateral regions associated with social semantic memory predominated during ToM. Overall, this study demonstrates that ToM involves a dynamic interplay between AM and social semantic memory that is biased towards AM when a personally familiar other is the subject of the mental state inference.

AB  - In the past 40 years, the research of cognitive psychology has been changing in both theory and technology to make this field more diverse and yet more integrative than before. This article provides a critical review on the changes of semantic processing and semantic representations with a focus on Chinese studies of Taiwanese researchers. The authors point out what potential limitations are in the literature and how subsequent changes come to answer critical questions. Two trends of changes on semantic processing and representations are observed, including a shift from adult participants to child participants and a shift from behavioral measures to neuroimaging measures. In the end, three suggestions are proposed for future directions: exploring topics of metaphor to understand semantics beyond the character/word level, recruiting neurologically impaired participants to examine the functional architecture of semantic representational systems, and using a longitudinal approach to evaluating developmental changes of semantic processing and representations.

TI  - Functional anatomical development of task set processes: An fMRI examination
AU  - Wenger, Kristin Kay
AB  - During development, it is likely that many substantial changes in cognitive abilities are driven, in part, by the increased ability to configure information processing pathways for task performance. This research investigates the developmental functional neuroanatomy of processes underlying task instantiation and maintenance, termed task set processes. These processes, originating in the task set system and identifiable by transient and sustained profiles of neural activity, provide top-down control in order to influence moment-to-moment processing in the brain's data processing systems. This dissertation describes two experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The first experiment established that both transient and sustained signals could be compared between adults and 7- to 8-year-old children performing a visual experiment. Significant between-group differences were observed neither for transient nor for sustained activity in visual cortex. These results indicate that, in cognitive experiments, between-group differences in transient and sustained activity may be more readily ascribed to age-related differences in information processing rather than to physiological differences underlying the measured signals. In the second experiment in this dissertation, adults and 7- to 9-year-old children performed a task requiring living/non-living category judgments on pictures. Two main conclusions are supported by the data. First, many task set processes appear to be established in children by ages 7-9: children exhibit activity in putative adult task set regions, as shown through both a meta-analytic approach and through a direct comparison of adult and child data. The second conclusion is that, in spite of similarity in task set processes, the interaction of the task set system with the data processing systems appears different for adults and children. It is discussed that adults may place a greater emphasis on a visual processing strategy than do children. Overall, results indicate that the brain's task set system and data processing systems may follow different developmental trajectories, with earlier establishment of more general task control processes.

AB  - Background: Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have revealed various ADHD-related dysfunctional brain regions, with heterogeneous findings across studies. Here, we used novel meta-analytic data-driven approaches to characterize the function and connectivity profile of ADHD-related dysfunctional regions consistently detected across studies. Methods: We first conducted an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 24 task-based fMRI studies in adults with ADHD. Each ADHD-related dysfunctional region resulting from the activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was then analyzed using functional decoding based on ~7500 fMRI experiments in the BrainMap database. This approach allows mapping brain regions to functions not necessarily tested in individual studies, thus suggesting possible novel functions for those regions. Additionally, ADHD-related dysfunctional regions were clustered based on their functional coactivation profiles across all the experiments stored in BrainMap (meta-analytic connectivity modeling). Results: ADHD-related hypoactivation was found in the left putamen, left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), left temporal pole, and right caudate. Functional decoding mapped the left putamen to cognitive aspects of music perception/reproduction and the left temporal lobe to language semantics; both these regions clustered together on the basis of their meta-analytic functional connectivity. Left inferior gyrus mapped to executive function tasks; right caudate mapped to both executive function tasks and music-related processes. Conclusions: Our study provides meta-analytic support to the hypothesis that, in addition to well-known deficits in typical executive functions, impairment in processes related to music perception/reproduction and language semantics may be involved in the pathophysiology of adult ADHD.

AB  - Neuropsychological and neuroimaging data suggest that the self-memory system can be fractionated into three functionally independent systems processing personal information at several levels of abstraction, including episodic memories of one’s life (episodic autobiographical memory, EAM), semantic knowledge of facts about one’s life (semantic autobiographical memory, SAM), and semantic knowledge of one’s personality [conceptual self, (CS)]. Through the study of two developmental amnesic patients suffering of neonatal brain injuries, we explored how the different facets of the self-memory system develop when growing up with bilateral hippocampal atrophy. Neuropsychological evaluations showed that both of them suffered from dramatic episodic learning disability with no sense of recollection (Remember/Know procedure), whereas their semantic abilities differed, being completely preserved (Valentine) or not (Jocelyn). Magnetic resonance imaging, including quantitative volumetric measurements of the hippocampus and adjacent (entorhinal, perirhinal, and temporopolar) cortex, showed severe bilateral atrophy of the hippocampus in both patients, with additional atrophy of adjacent cortex in Jocelyn. Exploration of EAM and SAM according to lifetime periods covering the entire lifespan (TEMPAu task, Piolino et al., 2009) showed that both patients had marked impairments in EAM, as they lacked specificity, details and sense of recollection, whereas SAM was completely normal in Valentine, but impaired in Jocelyn. Finally, measures of patients’ CS (Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, Fitts and Warren, 1996), checked by their mothers, were generally within normal range, but both patients showed a more positive self-concept than healthy controls. These two new cases support a modular account of the medial-temporal lobe with episodic memory and recollection depending on the hippocampus, and semantic memory and familiarity on adjacent cortices. Furthermore, they highlight developmental episodic and semantic functional independence within the self-memory system suggesting that SAM and CS may be acquired without episodic memories.

AB  - Object and depth perception from motion cues involves the recruitment of visual dorsal stream brain areas. In 3-D structure-from-motion (SFM) perception, motion and depth information are first extracted in this visual stream to allow object categorization, which is in turn mediated by the ventral visual stream. Such interplay justifies the use of SFM paradigms to understand dorsal–ventral integration of visual information. The nature of such processing is particularly interesting to be investigated in a neurological model of cognitive dissociation between dorsal (impaired) and ventral stream (relatively preserved) processing, Williams syndrome (WS). In the current fMRI study, we assessed dorsal versus ventral stream processing by using a performance-matched 3-D SFM object categorization task. We found evidence for substantial reorganization of the dorsal stream in WS as assessed by whole-brain ANOVA random effects analysis, with subtle differences in ventral activation. Dorsal reorganization was expressed by larger medial recruitment in WS (cuneus, precuneus, and retrosplenial cortex) in contrast with controls, which showed the expected dorsolateral pattern (caudal intraparietal sulcus and lateral occipital cortex). In summary, we found a substantial reorganization of dorsal stream regions in WS in response to simple visual categories and 3-D SFM perception, with less affected ventral stream. Our results corroborate the existence of a medial dorsal pathway that provides the substrate for information rerouting and reorganization in the presence of lateral dorsal stream vulnerability. This interpretation is consistent with recent findings suggesting parallel routing of information in medial and lateral parts of dorsal stream.

AB  - Despite progress in identifying homogeneous subphenotypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) through factor analysis of the Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist (YBOCS-SC), prior solutions have been limited by a reliance on presupposed symptom categories rather than discrete symptoms. Furthermore, there have been few attempts to evaluate the familiality of OCD symptom dimensions. The purpose of this study was to extend prior work by this collaborative group in category-based dimensions by conducting the first-ever exploratory dichotomous factor analysis using individual OCD symptoms, comparing these results to a refined category-level solution, and testing the familiality of derived factors. Participants were 485 adults in the six-site OCD Collaborative Genetics Study, diagnosed with lifetime OCD using semi-structured interviews. YBOCS-SC data were factor analyzed at both the individual item and symptom category levels. Factor score intraclass correlations were calculated using a subsample of 145 independent affected sib pairs. The item- and category-level factor analyses yielded nearly identical 5-factor solutions. While significant sib–sib associations were found for four of the five factors, Hoarding and Taboo Thoughts were the most robustly familial (rICC ≥ 0.2). This report presents considerable converging evidence for a five-factor structural model of OCD symptoms, including separate factor analyses employing individual symptoms and symptom categories, as well as sibling concordance. The results support investigation of this multidimensional model in OCD genetic linkage studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Pediatric white matter disorders can be distinguished into well‐defined leukoencephalopathies, and undefined leukoencephalopathies. The first category may be subdivided into: (a) hypomyelinating disorders; (b) dysmyelinating disorders; (c) leukodystrophies; (d) disorders related to cystic degeneration of myelin; and (e) disorders secondary to axonal damage. The second category, representing up to 50% of leukoencephalopathies in childhood, requires a multidisciplinar approach in order to define novel homogeneous subgroups of patients, possibly representing 'new genetic disorders' (such as megalencephalic leukoencepahlopathy with subcortical cysts and vanishing white matter disease that have recently been identified). In the majority of cases, pediatric white matter disorders are inherited diseases. An integrated description of the clinical, neuroimaging and pathophysiological features is crucial for categorizing myelin disorders and better understanding their genetic basis. A review of the genetic disorders affecting white matter in the pediatric age, including some novel entities, is provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Describes theoretical and methodological developments in the use of functional neuroimaging techniques to study the neural basis of cognition, from early scientific efforts to link brain and behavior to the latest applications of fMRI and PET methods. The core of the book covers fMRI and PET studies in specific domains: attention, skill learning, semantic memory, language, episodic memory, working memory, and executive functions. By introducing a technique within the description of a domain, the book offers a clear explanation of the process while highlighting its biological context. The emphasis on readability makes the book ideal for classroom use in advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in cognitive neuroscience. This second edition has been updated to reflect new developments in the field, with existing chapters rewritten and new chapters added to each section. The section on history and methods now includes a chapter on the crucial topic of the physics of functional neuroimaging; the chapters on skill learning and executive functions are new to the domain section; and chapters on childhood development and emotion and social cognition have been added to the section on developmental, social, and clinical applications. The color insert has been increased in size, enhancing the visual display of representative findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Higher-level reading processes in children with dyslexia: A functional imaging study of sentence comprehension
AU  - Duong, Priscilla
AB  - This dissertation examined higher-level reading processes in children with dyslexia, given the importance of these processes in extracting meaning when reading. Few studies have examined the neural underpinnings of higher-level reading skills necessary for reading comprehension, such as semantic processing. Expanding our knowledge about the reading processes involved with reading comprehension is important for guiding intervention. This study included children with (n = 20) and without (n = 18) dyslexia (10 - 16 years old) from an archival dataset collected from the Bay Area. Participants completed a behavioral reading assessment battery as well as a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sentence comprehension task. As expected, results of behavioral analyses revealed that children with dyslexia relied more on word identification, possibly through lexical access, to comprehend text, whereas typically developing children primarily accomplished reading comprehension through phonological decoding. Contrary to expectations, fMRI results revealed that children with dyslexia had overactivation in the grapheme-to-phonological network, namely the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and no areas of underactivation in the orthographic-to-semantic network. Furthermore, two sets of regression analyses were conducted with all participants together. Worse behavioral reading comprehension performance was associated with increased activation of the left SMG. The variable word reading residual (WRR) was created to isolate semantic processing at the word level, and scores were associated with right hemispheric frontal and parietal activation, which are implicated as compensatory brain regions in children with dyslexia. In conclusion, the present study furthers our knowledge of the processes involved in reading comprehension during childhood in both typically developing readers and those with dyslexia. Consistent with the definition of dyslexia suggesting deficient phonological decoding skills, neuroimaging findings suggest that there is abnormality in the grapheme-to-phonological network during reading comprehension. Findings also possibly suggest that the orthographic-to-semantic network is comparable in children with dyslexia and typically developing children during reading comprehension. However, these results must be interpreted with caution given that this is inferred from nonsignificant differences and lenient statistical thresholds. It is possible that with a larger sample size and more homogenous groups, there would be significant differences that would have validated the hypotheses.

AB  - The Landolt reading paradigm was created in order to dissociate effects of eye movements and attention from lexical, syntactic, and sub-lexical processing. While previous eye-tracking and behavioral findings support the usefulness of the paradigm, it remains to be shown that the paradigm actually relies on the brain networks for occulomotor control and attention, but not on systems for lexical/syntactic/orthographic processing. Here, 20 healthy volunteers underwent fMRI scanning while reading sentences (with syntax) or unconnected lists of written stimuli (no syntax) consisting of words (with semantics) or pseudowords (no semantics). In an additional 'Landolt reading' condition, all letters were replaced by closed circles, which should be scanned for targets (Landolt’s rings) in a reading-like fashion from left to right. A conjunction analysis of all five conditions revealed the visual scanning network which involved bilateral visual cortex, premotor cortex, and superior parietal cortex, but which did not include regions for semantics, syntax, or orthography. Contrasting the Landolt reading condition with all other regions revealed additional involvement of the right superior parietal cortex (areas 7A/7P/7PC) and postcentral gyrus (area 2) involved in deliberate gaze shifting. These neuroimaging findings demonstrate for the first time that the linguistic and orthographic brain network can be dissociated from a pure gaze-orienting network with the Landolt paradigm. Consequently, the Landolt paradigm may provide novel insights into the contributions of linguistic and non-linguistic factors on reading failure e.g., in developmental dyslexia.

AB  - Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating hemispheric dominance for language have shown that hemispheric specialization increases with age. We employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate these effects as a function of normal development. In sum, 22 healthy children aged 7-16 years were investigated using two language tasks: a verb-generation (VG) task and a vowel-identification (VI) task. Significant hemispheric differences were found for both tasks in cerebral language areas using oscillatory MEG spectral analyses, confirming the MEG's ability to detect hemispheric specialization for language in children. Additionally, a significant increase of this lateralization as a function of age was observed for both tasks. As performance in the VI task showed no correlation with age, this increase seems to be unrelated to performance. These results confirm an increase in hemispheric specialization as a function of normal brain maturation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Haist, Frank
AU  - Lee, Kang
AU  - Stiles, Joan
T2  - Frontiers in Human Neuroscience
AB  - Controversy surrounds the proposal that specific human cortical regions in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex, commonly called the fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA), are specialized for face processing. Here, we present findings from an fMRI study of identity discrimination of faces and objects that demonstrates the FFA and OFA are equally responsive to processing stimuli at the level of individuals (i.e., individuation), be they human faces or non-face objects. The FFA and OFA were defined via a passive viewing task as regions that produced greater activation to faces relative to non-face stimuli within the middle fusiform gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus. In the individuation task, participants judged whether sequentially presented images of faces, diverse objects, or wristwatches depicted the identical or a different exemplar. All three stimulus types produced equivalent BOLD activation within the FFA and OFA; that is, there was no face-specific or face-preferential processing. Critically, individuation processing did not eliminate an object superiority effect relative to faces within a region more closely linked to object processing in the lateral occipital complex (LOC), suggesting that individuation processes are reasonably specific to the FFA and OFA. Taken together, these findings challenge the prevailing view that the FFA and OFA are face-specific processing regions, demonstrating instead that they function to individuate-i.e., identify specific individuals-within a category. These findings have significant implications for understanding the function of brain regions widely believed to play an important role in social cognition.

AB  - To assess the effects of reading instruction on fMRI brain activation in children with dyslexia, the authors developed tasks to probe brain activation during phoneme mapping and morpheme mapping. Ten children with dyslexia and 11 normal readers performed these tasks during fMRI scanning. Children with dyslexia then completed 28 hours of comprehensive reading instruction. Scans were repeated on both dyslexic and control subjects using the same tasks. Results indicate that before treatment, children with dyslexia showed less activation than controls in left middle and inferior frontal gyri, right superior frontal gyrus, left middle and inferior temporal gyri, and bilateral superior parietal regions for phoneme mapping. Activation was significantly reduced for children with dyslexia on the initial morpheme mapping scan in left middle frontal gyrus, right superior parietal, and fusiform/occipital region. Treatment was associated with improved reading scores and increased brain activation during both tasks. These results suggest that behavioral gains from comprehensive reading instruction are associated with changes in brain function during performance of language tasks.

Instead, Dr. Schatzberg reports the following: Advising/Consulting: Abbott Laboratories, BrainCells Inc., Corcept Therapeutics, Eli Lilly and Co., Forest Laboratories, Merck & Co., Inc., Neuronetics, Novartis, Pathway Diagnostics, Quintiles, Synosis and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals; Grants: GlaxoSmithKline; Equity: Corcept Therapeutics, Forest Laboratories, Merck & Co., Inc., Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Somaxon Pharmaceuticals; Intellectual Property: named inventor on pharmacogenetic use patents on prediction of antidepressant response. David L. Braff previously reported Grant/Research Support for Allergan, Inc., Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi-Aventis and Johnson & Johnson. Instead, these disclosures should have been listed under the category of Advising/Consulting. Finally, an additional consulting relationship between Dr. Braff and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. was mistakenly left off the list and is now reported. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2008-04007-001[/rid].) Terrorists are attacking scientists who are attempting to alleviate human suffering. We need a concerted public effort to eliminate these acts, particularly the harassment of scientists studying nonhuman primates. This need is highlighted by the attacks upon the home of our friend and colleague, the noted medical scientist, Dr. Edy, the London, professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences and of molecular and medical pharmacology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). Her work exemplifies the unique role of research involving nonhuman primates in enabling the results of research in simple systems and lower organisms to be applied to human diseases. Dr. London suffered two attacks upon her home within 4 months that have escalated in their level of threat to her life and work. The first attack involved flooding of her home, the second attach involved setting fire to her home. These crimes mirror other recent attacks on scientists conducting medical research involving animals, only a few of which we will mention here. It is impossible to reconcile the willingness of these terrorists to harm humans, particularly people who are working to alleviate human suffering, with their contention that they value life of all kinds. Scientists, like Dr. London, care about the primates that they study. These terrorist acts might intimidate people and institutions that would otherwise speak out in support of nonhuman primate research and against terrorism. By failing to take public action, we contribute to the isolation of the scientists involved and the institutions in which they work. We seek a more vigorous investigation and prosecution of the criminals committing the crimes against these scientists, their staffs, their families, their neighbors, and the communities in which they live. Lastly, we wish to laud the dedication and courage shown by Dr. London and those like her that continue to strive to reduce suffering and advance science despite obvious personal cost. As the beneficiaries of progress in medical care, it is also our responsibility to join the struggle to preserve medical research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Different languages map semantic elements of spatial relations onto different lexical and syntactic units. These crosslinguistic differences raise important questions for language development in terms of how this variation is learned by children. We investigated how Turkish-, English-, and Japanese-speaking children (mean age 3;8) package the semantic elements of Manner and Path onto syntactic units when both the Manner and the Path of the moving Figure occur simultaneously and are salient in the event depicted. Both universal and language-specific patterns were evident in our data. Children used the semantic-syntactic mappings preferred by adult speakers of their own languages, and even expressed subtle syntactic differences that encode different relations between Manner and Path in the same way as their adult counterparts (i.e., Manner causing vs. incidental to Path). However, not all types of semantics-syntax mappings were easy for children to learn (e.g., expressing Manner and Path elements in two verbal clauses). In such cases, Turkish- and Japanese-speaking children frequently used syntactic patterns that were not typical in the target language but were similar to patterns used by English-speaking children, suggesting some universal influence. Thus, both language-specific and universal tendencies guide the development of complex spatial expressions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology
AB  - Event-related potential (ERP), reaction time (RT), and response accuracy measures were obtained during rhyming and semantic classification of spoken words in 10 average reading (aged 9.1–13.1 yrs) and 9 impaired reading (aged 9.5–14.0 yrs) children and adolescents. The behavioral measures of classification did not distinguish the groups. In the ERPs, rhyme processing produced more pronounced group differences than did semantic processing at about 480 msec, with a relatively more negative distribution for the impaired readers at centroparietal sites. At about 800 msec in both classification tasks, the impaired readers displayed a late positivity that was delayed in latency and of larger amplitude at frontal sites than that for the average readers. ERP findings suggest that the categorization of spoken words for meaning and sound result in increasingly more aberrant correlates of these processing demands in reading-impaired children.

AB  - The introduction of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy into clinical practice has permitted advances in the definition and categorization of unknown leukodystrophies in children. We report a new type of leukodystrophy, defined by particular MRI and clinical findings, in a child with uneventful pre- and perinatal histories, spasticity, severe mental impairment with absence of language, and deafness. Brain MRI showed lobar white-matter signal abnormalities with extensive cysts in the anterior temporal lobe. The results of all metabolic screening tests, including the specific investigations for leukodystrophy, have been negative. Six years of clinical and MRI-magnetic resonance spectroscopy patient follow-up indicate a nonprogressive clinical and magnetic resonance picture. Owing to the striking similarities with the previous eight patients reported, this additional case supports the identification of a new leukodystrophy.

AB  - Several experiments carried out with a subset of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy have demonstrated normal memory performance at standard delays of recall (i.e. minutes to hours) but impaired performance over longer delays (i.e. days or weeks), suggesting altered long-term consolidation mechanisms. These mechanisms were specifically investigated in a group of five adult-onset pharmaco-sensitive patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, exhibiting severe episodic memory complaints despite normal performance at standardized memory assessment. In a first experiment, the magnitude of autobiographical memory loss was evaluated using retrograde personal memory tasks based on verbal and visual cues. In both conditions, results showed an unusual U-shaped pattern of personal memory impairment, encompassing most of the patients’ life, sparing however, periods of the childhood, early adulthood and past several weeks. This profile was suggestive of a long-term consolidation impairment of personal episodes, adequately consolidated over ‘short-term’ delays but gradually forgotten thereafter. Therefore, in a subsequent experiment, patients were submitted to a protocol specifically devised to investigate short and long-term consolidation of contextually-bound experiences (episodic memory) and context-free information (semantic knowledge and single-items). In the short term (1 h), performance at both contextually-free and contextually-bound memory tasks was intact. After a 6-week delay, however, contextually-bound memory performance was impaired while contextually-free memory performance remained preserved. This effect was independent of task difficulty and the modality of retrieval (recall and recognition). Neuroimaging studies revealed the presence of mild metabolic changes within medial temporal lobe structures. Taken together, these results show the existence of different consolidation systems within declarative memory. They suggest that mild medial temporal lobe dysfunction can impede the building and stabilization of episodic memories but leaves long-term semantic and single-items mnemonic traces intact.

T2  - The Clinical Neuropsychologist
AB  - Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare hereditary metabolic condition where the body is unable to breakdown amino acids causing toxic buildup. Acute and long-term management of MSUD involves a restricted diet and regular monitoring of amino acid levels; however, more recently liver transplants have been shown to be successful in treating this condition. Even with successful management of MSUD there is evidence from pediatric cases that shows a distinct pattern of neurocognitive deficits associated with this condition, including impaired nonverbal skills and psychomotor functioning with relatively intact verbal abilities. In the present paper, we report an adult case of MSUD with associated neurocognitive deficits and functional limitations following liver transplantation. Neuroimaging revealed no structural abnormalities, while the results from the neuropsychological evaluation showed impairment in visual-spatial processing, attention, executive functioning, and psychomotor abilities, with relative strengths in verbal skills. The patient also showed reduced adaptive functioning and mild anxiety. This case demonstrates neurocognitive deficiencies within the context of normal magnetic resonance imaging. The possible underlying mechanism of this neuropsychological profile is discussed in relation to other neurodevelopmental models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this volume, as in the discussions at the conference from which it derives, the authors are pushing the frontiers of research approaches and methods in infant language and cognition. They are innovatively combining methods, introducing new measures, and demonstrating the use of technologies and measurement approaches that can inform the study of word learning and categorization, gaze, attention, gesture, and physiological functions. The book is laid out in four main sections (with an introduction and final chapter not within those sections). The first section of the book, 'Recognizing Patterns,' deals with infants' ability to recognize and generalize from patterns for linguistic and nonlinguistic input. In Section 2 of the book, 'From Patterns to Meaning,' the authors address how infant speech perception, social cognition, early conceptualization, and learning link to meaning and how all of this links to language learning itself. In Section 3, 'Predictors of Language Emergence,' the authors present detailed data to support their contentions that attention, gaze, and gesture, when deconstructed into measurable or observable components, can predict later language outcomes, rate of growth, or the emergence of new language abilities. In Section 4, 'Models and Methods to Study Language,' Patricia Kuhl presents her own model, the Native Language Model; Leslie Cohen and Jason Brunt address methodological approaches in general; and Gary Marcus and Hugh Rabagliatti bring us up to date on statistical modeling; each chapter uses the work of the authors' own laboratory teams to instantiate the discussion with real data. Finally, Lisa Freund discusses neuroimaging tools that can now or may soon in the future be usable with infants and young children. Those who work in infant language and cognition must not only be aware of the work that is being done using paradigms and methodologies other than their own; they must also consider with an open mind the possibility that these other theories could play a role in their own work. We must embrace the excitement of intellectual debate and infuse it with data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - To address inconsistencies in the literature on memory in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we report the first ever meta-analysis of short-term memory (STM) and episodic long-term memory (LTM) in ASD, evaluating the effects of type of material, type of retrieval and the role of interitem relations. Analysis of 64 studies comparing individuals with ASD and typical development (TD) showed greater difficulties in ASD compared with TD individuals in STM (Hedges’ g = −0.53, 95% CI [−0.90, −0.16], p = .005, I² = 96%) compared with LTM (g = −0.30, 95% CI [−0.42, −0.17], p < .00001, I² = 24%), a small difficulty in verbal LTM (g = −0.21, p = .01), contrasting with a medium difficulty for visual LTM (g = −0.41, p = .0002) in ASD compared with TD individuals. We also found a general diminution in free recall compared with cued recall and recognition (LTM, free recall: g = −0.38, p < .00001, cued recall: g = −0.08, p = .58, recognition: g = −0.15, p = .16; STM, free recall: g = −0.59, p = .004, recognition: g = −0.33, p = .07). We discuss these results in terms of their relation to semantic memory. The limited diminution in verbal LTM and preserved overall recognition and cued recall (supported retrieval) may result from a greater overlap of these tasks with semantic long-term representations which are overall preserved in ASD. By contrast, difficulties in STM or free recall may result from less overlap with the semantic system or may involve additional cognitive operations and executive demands. These findings highlight the need to support STM functioning in ASD and acknowledge the potential benefit of using verbal materials at encoding and broader forms of memory support at retrieval to enhance performance.

AB  - Rationale: Methylphenidate, the most common treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is increasingly used by healthy individuals as a 'smart drug' to enhance cognitive abilities like attention. A key feature of (selective) attention is the ability to ignore irrelevant but salient information in the environment (distractors). Although crucial for cognitive performance, until now, it is not known how the use of methylphenidate affects resistance to attentional capture by distractors. Objectives: The present study aims to clarify how methylphenidate affects distractor suppression in healthy individuals. Methods: The effect of methylphenidate (20 mg) on distractor suppression was assessed in healthy subjects (N = 20), in a within-subject double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. We used a visuospatial attention task with target faces flanked by strong (faces) or weak distractors (scrambled faces). Results: Methylphenidate increased accuracy on trials that required gender identification of target face stimuli (methylphenidate 88.9 ± 1.4 [mean ± SEM], placebo 86.0 ± 1.2 %; p = .003), suggesting increased processing of the faces. At the same time, however, methylphenidate increased reaction time when the target face was flanked by a face distractor relative to a scrambled face distractor (methylphenidate 34.9 ± 3.73, placebo 26.7 ± 2.84 ms; p = .027), suggesting enhanced attentional capture by distractors with task-relevant features. Conclusions: We conclude that methylphenidate amplifies salience of task-relevant information at the level of the stimulus category. This leads to enhanced processing of the target (faces) but also increased attentional capture by distractors drawn from the same category as the target.

AB  - The Mangina-Test provides a neuropsychometric assessment of varying degrees of 'Analytical-Specific Visual Perception', i.e., the ability to identify simple stimuli inserted into more complex ones according to their exact geometrical properties in a limited span of time. Perceptual analysis of stimuli dealing with the exact discrimination of size and dimension is related more to mathematical abilities (MATH), while perceptual analysis of direction and spatial orientation is related more to abilities in reading and reading comprehension (READ). Some stimuli are MIXED since they deal with both of the above features combined. We previously determined the distributed neuronal network of analytical-specific visual perceptual processes as measured by the Mangina-Test. Here, we aim at further assessing as to how brain activity is differentially modulated by the discrimination of very subtle category-specific perceptual relationships. Brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging in 12 young healthy subjects while they performed a computer-adapted version of the Mangina-Test. Behavioral results of the present study indicate that performance was not different among stimulus categories. However, brain functional data show that analytical-specific perceptual processes for MATH, READ and MIXED stimuli rely on partially distinct brain circuits. Bilateral posterior parietal, premotor and prefrontal regions along with the anterior cingulate appeared to be more activated by MATH stimuli, while READ stimuli predominantly activated bilateral medial occipito-temporal, amygdala/parahippocampal and sensorimotor cortices, and the right inferior frontal cortex. Moreover, the posterior parahippocampal cortex showed a higher activity specifically for MIXED stimuli. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that in the Mangina-Test, the exact discrimination of very subtle perceptual relationships between geometrical stimuli distinctly modulates cerebral activity, so that category-specific brain responses can be related to identifiable cognitive abilities.

AB  - Large‐scale brain networks play a prominent role in cognitive abilities and their activity is impaired in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) are at high risk of developing schizophrenia and present similar cognitive impairments, including executive functions deficits. Thus, 22q11DS represents a model for the study of neural biomarkers associated with schizophrenia. In this study, we investigated structural and functional connectivity within and between the Default Mode (DMN), the Central Executive (CEN), and the Saliency network (SN) in 22q11DS using resting‐state fMRI and DTI. Furthermore, we investigated if triple network impairments were related to executive dysfunctions or the presence of psychotic symptoms. Sixty‐three patients with 22q11DS and sixty‐eighty controls (age 6–33 years) were included in the study. Structural connectivity between main nodes of DMN, CEN, and SN was computed using probabilistic tractography. Functional connectivity was computed as the partial correlation between the time courses extracted from each node. Structural and functional connectivity measures were then correlated to executive functions and psychotic symptom scores. Our results showed mainly reduced structural connectivity within the CEN, DMN, and SN, in patients with 22q11DS compared with controls as well as reduced between‐network connectivity. Functional connectivity appeared to be more preserved, with impairments being evident only within the DMN. Structural connectivity impairments were also related to executive dysfunctions. These findings show an association between triple network structural alterations and executive deficits in patients with the microdeletion, suggesting that 22q11DS and schizophrenia share common psychopathological mechanisms.

TI  - Neural bases of core and conceptual self: Implications for the representation of other persons and groups of people
AU  - Drucker, Jonathan Harris
AB  - Self-representation is multifaceted. Building on prior research, the current experiment explores two such facets, core and conceptual self, and how these constructs extend to neurocognitive representations of other persons and groups of people. Core self is a representation of oneself as an individual whose subjective experience is unified within a particular moment. It includes identification with one's body (body ownership), authorship for one's actions (agency), and an embodied, egocentric point of view (first-person perspective). Conceptual self is a representation of oneself as an individual whose identity persists through time. It includes one's personality traits and physical characteristics, and the narrative of one's life constructed from accumulated autobiographical memories. I conducted an fMRI experiment (N = 19) to determine the neural correlates of core and conceptual representations for the self, other persons, and groups of people. On each trial, participants were presented for three seconds with an individual (the self, a relative, a friend, or an acquaintance), a group (adults or children), or a semantic prompt (physical or genetic). Participants were then presented for three seconds with a property (e.g., tall) and rated how well the property applied to the individual (e.g., how tall is the individual?), group (e.g., how tall are children?), or prompt (e.g., to what extent is tall a genetic property?). The first phase, in which the individual, group, or prompt was presented, was intended to elicit core representations. The second phase, in which the property was presented, was intended to elicit conceptual representations. The core self condition recruited brain areas associated with body ownership, agency, the first-person perspective, and visuospatial imagery. The conceptual self condition involved these as well, and further implicated brain areas associated with representing personality traits, semantic person knowledge, and executive control of memory retrieval, decision making, and theory-of-mind. Representations for other persons and groups of people rely on these and other systems insofar as the information they provide is relevant to the task at hand, and available with respect to that person or group of people. Some differences between self and other were modulated by the closeness of the personal relationship. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Fluid reasoning, or the capacity to think logically and solve novel problems, is central to the development of human cognition, but little is known about the underlying neural changes. During the acquisition of event-related fMRI data, children aged 6-13 (N = 16) and young adults (N = 17) performed a task in which they were asked to identify semantic relationships between drawings of common objects. On semantic problems, participants indicated which of five objects was most closely semantically related to a cued object. On analogy problems, participants solved a visual propositional analogy (e.g., shoe is to foot as glove is to...?) by indicating which of four objects would complete the problem; these problems required integration of two semantic relations, or relational integration. Our prior research on analogical reasoning in adults implicated left anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in the controlled retrieval of individual semantic relationships, and rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) in relational integration. In this study, age-related changes in the recruitment of VLPFC, temporal cortex, and other cortical regions were observed during the retrieval of individual semantic relations. In contrast, age-related changes in RLPFC function were observed during relational integration. Children aged 6-13 engage RLPFC too late in the analogy trials to influence their behavioral responses, suggesting that important changes in RLPFC function take place during adolescence.

AB  - Investigations of the neural correlates of face recognition have typically used old/new paradigms where subjects learn to recognize new faces or identify famous faces. Familiar faces, however, include one's own face, partner's and parents' faces. Using event-related fMRI, we examined the neural correlates of these personally familiar faces. Ten participants were presented with photographs of own, partner, parents, famous and unfamiliar faces and responded to a distinct target. Whole brain, two regions of interest (fusiform gyrus and cingulate gyrus), and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Compared with baseline, all familiar faces activated the fusiform gyrus; own faces also activated occipital regions and the precuneus; partner faces activated similar areas, but in addition, the parahippocampal gyrus, middle superior temporal gyri and middle frontal gyrus. Compared with unfamiliar faces, only personally familiar faces activated the cingulate gyrus and the extent of activation varied with face category. Partner faces also activated the insula, amygdala and thalamus. Regions of interest analyses and laterality indices showed anatomical distinctions of processing the personally familiar faces within the fusiform and cingulate gyri. Famous faces were right lateralized whereas personally familiar faces, particularly partner and own faces, elicited bilateral activations. Regression analyses show experiential predictors modulated with neural activity related to own and partner faces. Thus, personally familiar faces activated the core visual areas and extended frontal regions, related to semantic and person knowledge and the extent and areas of activation varied with face type.

AB  - Gestures are an important part of human communication. However, little is known about the neural correlates of gestures accompanying speech comprehension. The goal of this study is to investigate the neural basis of speech–gesture interaction as reflected in activation increase and decrease during observation of natural communication. Fourteen German participants watched video clips of 5 s duration depicting an actor who performed metaphoric gestures to illustrate the abstract content of spoken sentences. Furthermore, video clips of isolated gestures (without speech), isolated spoken sentences (without gestures) and gestures in the context of an unknown language (Russian)were additionally presented while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired. Bimodal speech and gesture processing led to left hemispheric activation increases of the posterior middle temporal gyrus, the premotor cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the right superior temporal sulcus. Activation reductions during the bimodal condition were located in the left superior temporal gyrus and the left posterior insula. Gesture related activation increases and decreases were dependent on language semantics and were not found in the unknown-language condition. Our results suggest that semantic integration processes for bimodal speech plus gesture comprehension are reflected in activation increases in the classical left hemispheric language areas. Speech related gestures seem to enhance language comprehension during the face-to-face communication. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Patients with phonologic alexia can be trained to read semantically impoverished words (e.g., functors) by pairing them with phonologically-related semantically rich words (e.g, nouns). What mechanisms underlie success in this cognitive re-training approach? Does the mechanism change if the skill is 'overlearned', i.e., practiced beyond criterion? We utilized fMRI pre- and post-treatment, and after overlearning, to assess treatment-related functional reorganization in a patient with phonologic alexia, 2 years post left temporoparietal stroke. Pre-treatment, there were no statistically significant differences in activation profiles across the sets of words. Post-treatment, accuracy on the two trained sets improved. Compared with untrained words, reading trained words recruited larger and more significant clusters of activation in the right hemisphere, including right inferior frontal and inferior parietal cortex. Post-overlearning, with near normal performance on overlearned words, predominant activation shifted to left hemisphere regions, including perilesional activation in superior parietal lobe, when reading overlearned vs. untrained words.

TI  - Neural mechanisms underlying visual word recognition in reading
AU  - Wang, Fang
AB  - Neural mechanisms underlying visual word recognition in reading, especially whether and how other linguistic information exerts influence on visual-orthographic processing, were investigated in the current thesis. Study 1 explored whether early stages of visual-orthographic processing can be modulated by different linguistic features based on different task demands. EEG data of 20 native Chinese speakers were recorded while participants performed three tasks: delayed naming, repetition detection, and blue color detection. Responses to familiar Chinese and unfamiliar Korean characters were compared. Results demonstrated that neural tuning to print is modulated by task demands already within the first 250ms, suggesting that early visual-orthographic processing may be less automatic than it was thought, and can be modulated by task top-down modulations during early stages. Study 2 examined the influence of category-level expectations on visual-orthographic processing. Familiar Chinese and unfamiliar Korean characters were used as stimulus conditions. Category-level expectations about the upcoming stimuli were manipulated with green and blue colored frames before stimulus onset. EEG data of 18 native Chinese speakers were recorded while participants performed an expectation judgment task. Results found that similar as the early task top-down modulations in study 1, category-level expectations started to take effect at early stages as well. The findings indicate that category-level expectations could also modulate early visual-orthographic processing even within 200 ms. Study 3 explored the influence of auditory-phonologic processing on visual-orthographic processing in at-risk children for developmental dyslexia using fMRI. 33 healthy, German speaking at-risk children (17 normal readers, 16 poor readers) participated in a behavioral and a combined EEG-fMRI session firstly in the middle of first grade and were followed up after one year of reading instruction at school. An implicit target detection task was employed and short nonwords (e.g., 'rof') were presented in an auditory and visual, and in a bimodal congruent and incongruent fashion. Audiovisual (AV) integration was investigated by comparing AV congruent to AV incongruent stimuli (congruency effect). Activation changes for the congruency effect from first to second grade can predict especially pseudoword reading performance improvement. Normal and poor reading groups differed in terms of functional coupling of left OT with the dorsal parietal attention network and the left OT coupling to frontal areas. These results provide evidence that audiovisual integration and the functional connection between phonological and orthographic brain areas differ between normal and poor reading at-risk for development dyslexia children, which may then present targets for early intervention in children showing poor reading development. Overall, the fMRI data and EEG data together can provide both localization and timing of how print is connected to other linguistic information (e.g., speech sound) in the developing and mature brain within different language contexts (i.e., opaque logographic Chinese and rather transparent alphabetic German).

AB  - Reading is an acquired skill; unlike spoken language acquisition it has to be taught and there are significant individual differences in how well people read. The suite of neuroimaging studies described in this dissertation share an underlying theme of how the brain supports reading fluency and expertise. The first experiment explored a basic component of reading, letter identification. Participants matched a target letter with two alternatives. Conditions included same-case (a-a), mixed-case (a-A), and Korean letter matching across two levels of difficulty. Across the ventral visual stream, Korean letters produced the greatest signal activation. The mixed and same-case conditions activated the ventral stream to a lesser extent and were indistinguishable from one another. Additional activation (mixed>same>Korean and hard>easy) was observed in left perisylvian area reflecting phonological processing. Thus letter categorization depends on phonological information in letter names, rather than a ventral visual area dedicated to abstract representations of letters. The second set of experiments gathered function snapshots of early word-processing that occur within the first few hundred milliseconds of processing. Words with varying frequencies were presented for short durations via gated masking to leverage brain activation information about the time course of word processing. This method failed to distinguish between factors of interest. The long mask presentation may have generated extra-strong visual activity, obscuring subtle differences between conditions. Moreover, it was assumed that the mask limited processing, however, it may not have completely extinguished processing. In the third experiment, children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) participated in a combined behavioral and neuroimaging study to explore the disorder's consequences on reading organization. Two control groups were used: the standard age-matched group and a group of younger typically developing children with comparable language and reading skills. The results suggest that when equated for language skills, children with SLI still employ differential neural processing strategies to overcome their severe phonological weakness. Together, these three experiments yield a more detailed picture of the neural computations that support reading and literacy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Behavioral research has suggested a trade-off relationship between individual recognition and race categorization of own- and other-race faces, which is an important behavioral marker of face processing expertise. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this trade-off. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodology, we concurrently asked participants to recognize and categorize own- and other-race faces to examine the neural correlates of this trade-off relationship. We found that for other-race faces, the fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA) responded more to recognition than categorization, whereas for own-race faces, the responses were equal for the 2 tasks. The right superior temporal sulcus (STS) responses were the opposite to those of the FFA and OFA. Further, recognition enhanced the functional connectivity from the right FFA to the right STS, whereas categorization enhanced the functional connectivity from the right OFA to the right STS. The modulatory effects of these 2 couplings were negatively correlated. Our findings suggested that within the core face processing network, although recognizing and categorizing own- and other-race faces activated the same neural substrates, there existed neural trade-offs whereby their activations and functional connectivities were modulated by face race type and task demand due to one’s differential processing expertise with own- and other-race faces.

AB  - Neurobiological assessment for psychiatric disorders can't come along too quickly. Child mental health has several needs for such technology. The field needs to rapidly and easily measure the various capacities of the central nervous system (CNS) so that we can accurately evaluate cognitive, emotional, and behavioral variation. We need to go further and measure the genetic variation of these domains to understand risk and vulnerability prior to their developmental manifestations. The discovery, testing, validation, and dissemination of technological procedures to fill gaps in our assessment protocols could reshape our practice of patient care, standards of treatment, the scope of our intervention goals, and the direction in which resources are expended on mental health care. We currently face many problems with assessment that are still answered in ways based on decades-old approaches. What tools do we need, for example, that would allow us to know if a child with poor academic progress and identified dyslexia also had attentional problems that were consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) inattentive type? Or if an adolescent presented as withdrawn, isolated, and self-destructive, what neurobiological assessment would allow us to easily tell whether this was an acute reaction to significant loss, a major depressive disorder, or bipolar disorder? Could we use neuroimaging to separate very early prodromes of schizophrenia from Asperger's syndrome? Could we curtail the time burden of developmental, family, and medical history-taking by simply applying a piece of modern-day miracle technology? Do we have the neurobiological tools to refine diagnosis and treatment planning? At this point we do not. If we could, our entire nomenclature might need changing. For example, if neuroimaging provided enough information about brain-behavior relationships we might decide that disorders of the frontal cortex should be a major DSMx category. Limbic system disorders might encompass depression, anxiety, and adjustment disorders if assessment techniques could discriminate among them. New categories would group global brain problems such as mental retardation and autism together. Specific brain region disorders would be a collection of problems such as simple motor tic disorder, habit disorders, and blepharospasm. Rapid neurobiological assessment using one of the many forms of imaging such as positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and the various forms of magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) would improve identification and move treatment to early onset or even prodromal stages. We now have these technologies but they have not revolutionized the way we work with patients, and it may be time to hope the next generation of technologies will create these opportunities. An alternative is to start to look elsewhere for technologies that are waiting to be brought to clinical practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Neurobiological foundations of self-conscious emotion understanding in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders
AU  - Jankowski, Kathryn Felice
AB  - This dissertation explored the subjective experience and neural correlates of self-conscious emotion (SCE) understanding in adolescent males with high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and age-matched neurotypical (NT) males (ages 11-17). Study I investigated group differences in SCE attributions (the ability to recognize SCEs conveyed by others) and empathic SCEs (the ability/tendency to feel empathic SCEs for others) in 56 adolescents (ASD = 30; NT = 26). It also explored associations between SCE processing and a triad of social cognitive abilities (self-awareness/introspection, perspective-taking/cognitive empathy, affective empathy) and autistic symptoms/traits. Study II investigated the neural correlates of SCE processing in 52 adolescents (ASD = 27; NT = 25). During an MRI scan, participants completed the Self-Conscious Emotions Task-Child, which included 24 salient, ecologically-valid videos of adolescents participating in a singing competition. Videos represented two factors: emotion (embarrassment, pride) and perspective-taking (PT) demands (low, high). In low PT clips, singers' emotions matched their performance (sing poorly, act embarrassed); in high PT clips, they did not (sing well, act embarrassed). Participants used a 4-point Likert scale to rate how intensely embarrassed and proud singers felt. They made congruent ratings, which matched the conveyed emotions (rating how embarrassed an embarrassed singer felt), and incongruent ratings, which did not match the conveyed emotions (rating how proud an embarrassed singer felt). Outside the scanner, participants rated how empathically embarrassed and proud they felt for the singers. The ASD and NT groups made similarly intense inferred congruent and empathic congruent SCE ratings, suggesting that emotion attribution and affective empathy are intact in ASD. However, the ASD group made more intense inferred incongruent SCE ratings, suggesting that emotion attribution in ASD may be more strongly impacted by the situational context. An over-reliance on contextual cues may reflect a strict adherence to rule-following and serve as a compensatory strategy for attenuated mentalizing. Neuroimaging results support this interpretation. The ASD group recruited atypical neural patterns within social cognition regions, visual perception regions, salience regions, and sensorimotor regions. These findings similarly suggest an over-reliance on abstract social conceptual knowledge when processing discrepant affective and contextual cues. Implications for intervention are discussed.

TI  - Neurobiological perspectives on social phobia: From affiliation to zoology
AU  - Stein, Murray B.
T2  - Biological Psychiatry
AB  - Reviews the neurobiology of social phobia (SP). It is apparent from the extant literature that this disorder is poorly understood from a neurobiological perspective. There are nonetheless a number of clinical and preclinical observations which, at times, converge to illuminate areas worthy of further study. Included in this category are suggestive findings of central serotonergic dysregulation in SP, response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors in SP, and the role of serotonergic function in septohippocampal models of anxiety. Abnormalities in central dopaminergic function are also posited, supported to some extent by recent neuroimaging findings. There are also a number of animal and human behavioral models in existence that may be relevant to the study of SP. Included in this category are models of social dominance in wild baboons, social affiliation in the prairie vole, and behavioral inhibition to the unfamiliar in childhood. Newer technologies that are likely to play a major role in the delineation of the neural circuitry and heritability of SP are discussed. Finally, an interactive role for biology and experience in the expression of SP is considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The Clinical Neuropsychologist
AB  - Alexander disease is a neurological condition associated with prominent white matter deterioration. Its rarity and relatively rapid disease course have provided limited understanding into the cognitive effects of the illness. We report the serial neuropsychological findings of a 21-year-old with normal development and no medical history until age 9, when he experienced refractory sinusitis, stabbing headaches with vertigo, disorientation, and decline in academic and social settings. An MRI scan of the brain found acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, with a preponderance of white matter degeneration in the bilateral frontal lobes. Interval MRIs showed continued degeneration. Confirmation of Alexander disease was made at age 20 through genetic testing. Four evaluations completed from ages 15 to 21 showed impairment across all cognitive domains. Cognitive deficits were most prominent in new learning and recent memory, executive functions, and fine motor dexterity, and less apparent in information processing and visual scanning speed. These results present evidence for a particular cognitive pattern in individuals with juvenile-onset Alexander disease. Despite extensive white matter degeneration in the frontal lobes, certain tasks associated with frontal lobe integrity were relatively preserved. Further research into the neuropsychological presentation of the subtypes of Alexander disease can enhance diagnostic clarity and treatment planning.

AU  - Nagarajan, Lakshmi

T2  - Journal of Child Neurology
AB  - There is a high incidence of mortality and neurodevelopmental sequelae in babies with neonatal seizures. The electroencephalography (EEG) background has been shown to be an excellent predictor of outcome by most studies, with a few suggesting limited value in prognostication. Previous studies suggest poor prognosis with severely abnormal backgrounds, but prediction was difficult with moderate abnormalities. The proposed numerical scoring system for the EEG background provides an objective method of evaluation with improved reproducibility, categorization, and prognostication. Our study showed that the numerical score of EEG background was a good predictor of outcome. Higher numerical scores reflecting greater abnormality of background EEG were associated with increasing incidence of mortality, neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing impairment, and epilepsy. The numerical score also correlated with neuroimaging abnormalities. A numerical EEG score can help target interventional strategies for neonatal seizures.

T2  - Jornal Brasileiro de Psiquiatria
AB  - Objective: To perform a systematic review of manuscripts that used neurolmage to study the video game addiction in order to identify the main altered brain regions. Methods: Searches were realized in the following databases: ScieELO, BVS, Lilacs, Science Direct On Line and PubMed. There was no minimum date for the research, being considered articles founded until July 2013. The descriptors used for this systematic review were: 'PET', 'SPECT', 'MRI', 'DTI', 'EEG', 'imaging', 'neuroimaging', 'spectroscopy', 'functional magnetic resonance', 'structural magnetic resonance', 'tractography', 'voxel' and 'brain', individually crossed with descriptors 'gaming' and 'video game addiction'. Results: Of the 52 articles founded. 16 were selected: nine used fMRI, four used sRMI, one used PET and two used EEG. In relation of the functional and structural changes, they were more often observed in the frontal lobe (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus), parietal, temporal (parahippocampal gyrus), basal ganglia, thalamus, insula and cerebellum. Conclusion: Regardless the methods utilized, the studies pointed convergences regarding reciprocity brain. These neural changes are similar to those observed in patients with substance addiction and internet addiction, especially during craving. Although only recently neuroimaging researches on game addicts were realized, we count at the moment with significant findings aligned with the understanding of the neural mechanisms associated with video game addiction and its inclusion as a nosological category in psychiatric scope.

T2  - Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology
AB  - Comments on an article by Marnie N. Robinson et al. (see record [rid]2009-00561-009[/rid]). The authors add to the cerebral palsy (CP) neuroimaging literature by providing further population-based data and stratifying image findings by Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) categories. The results of this study are comparable to those of recent reviews/meta-analyses of CP imaging. The strengths of this study include population-based case ascertainment, consistent review of MRI findings, and use of the GMFCS. As stated in the paper, the proportion of cases without a completed MRI and associated potential selection bias is the primary limitation of the study; however, the incorporation of the GMFCS categorization provides new and useful information about imaging abnormalities and the associated severity of motor disability among cases of CP. The authors echo the need for an accepted uniform classification system for MRI abnormalities found among CP cases to facilitate meaningful inter-study comparisons. Currently, inter-study variation in collection and classification of images renders results less meaningful than if they were obtained in a standardized manner.

AB  - Our goals are to present current neuroimaging techniques and review their use in forensic settings. We present descriptions of X-ray, computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and of course magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) and provide brief historical backgrounds for each. We arbitrarily divide these techniques and their use in the forensic arena into measures of structure and measures of function. Although both of these broad measurement types sometimes use similar technical processes, they are different in their approaches in that structural measures focus on anatomy, and functional measures focus on activity of an anatomical area. We provide both supportive and cautionary evidence regarding the use of these methods in a legal context and opinion regarding the veracity of their current and future use as sensitive markers of developed or acquired change in the brain. We begin by reviewing methods of evaluating structural brain changes and their current use and likelihood of future use in the courtroom, followed by a similar treatise on functional brain imaging methods.

A2  - Kirkwood, Michael W.
A2  - Yeates, Keith Owen
AB  - The role of neuroimaging in the evaluation of children with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has evolved over the past decade as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are increasingly utilized. CT was initially used to determine whether a child had an intracranial injury (ICI) that required neurosurgical management. Subsequently, CT helped determine whether a child could safely be discharged from the emergency department or required hospitalization for continued observation as well as to assess a risk of long-term deficits. This application of CT technology led to an increasing number of scans, questions about their cost effectiveness,and development of decision rules (i.e., tools designed to help clinicians make bedside diagnostic and therapeutic decisions) to increase the diagnostic yield for ICI, although no consensus has been reached as to which set(s) of rules is optimal. In this chapter, we review recent data regarding the yield of CT, particularly related to clinical decision rules for ordering a scan. We also review the limited data regarding the use of MRI in cases of pediatric mTBI, in particular, advanced imaging sequences such as diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), MR spectroscopy,and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). We conclude the chapter with a discussion of the roles of CT and MRI in helping to define subcategories of mTBI within the context of a proposed imaging algorithm.

AB  - A number of neurological symptoms and disorders should be adequately evaluated in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) because they occur relatively frequently. Some belong to the category of the so-called soft signs and are detected by means of a thorough clinical evaluation in which the clinician looks for subtle dysfunctional signs. Others are more classic neurological disorders that need to be described in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the associated symptoms. An accurate standardized neurological evaluation, including muscle tone, gait, dominance and laterality, handedness, motor skills, praxis, and coordination in fine motor activities, is necessary for defining neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Two classes of soft signs have been recognized: mild but classic neurological signs such as ataxia, hypotonia, asymmetry in muscle tone, and deficits in sensorimotor function, and developmental soft signs, which refer to sensorimotor functions that reflect a delay in maturation (Mandelbaum et al. 2006). Epilepsy and movement disorders, however, are additional disorders—recognized as such—that need to be addressed and have important implications at both the clinical and etiological levels. In the current classification, epilepsy is listed as an associated symptom, whereas movement disorders have not been addressed in the current nosology. Current knowledge of the neurobiological basis of ASDs has contributed to the etiological factors that could be involved in additional neurological symptoms. Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated abnormalities in the dendritic tree outgrowth and pruning, in the synaptic connections, and in the development of neural fibers that may constitute the neurofunctional substrate for these neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Therefore, soft signs might be viewed as abnormalities unfolding throughout the complex neural network of brain development in autism, and the etiology of specific conditions, such as epilepsy, is still poorly understood. An overview of the main neurological signs, symptoms, and disorders in ASDs is herein provided. Neurological signs and symptoms in autism spectrum disorders should be routinely investigated with a developmental clinical approach. Hypotonia is a common finding, because head enlargement is evident in approximately 20% of individuals. In addition, dyspraxia, an impairment of motor sequences learning, is another common finding. Other types of sensorimotor deficits are detected in children with ASDs when standardized clinical examinations are performed. As to specific neurological disorders, epilepsy is known to affect a considerable proportion of children and adolescents with ASDs. There are two peak age risks for seizure onset: early childhood and adolescence. Any kind of seizure may be observed in ASDs. Current knowledge of the etiology and possible influence of epilepsy on ASDs is poorly known. Movement disorders are not rare and often go unnoticed because they overlap with the repetitive movements and typical behaviors of ASDs. Tics and Tourette's syndrome should be systematically examined, and catatonia and catatonia-like states have been reported; these additional symptoms warrant specific attention. Standardized assessment for movement disorders and dyskinesia is needed to further improve the diagnostic yield. The many neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms that add to and/or overlap with the core symptoms of ASDs are still not precisely defined, and their boundaries will be more thoroughly described as soon as future research addresses the domain of these additional symptoms. The identification of clinical subgroups of ASD according to associated symptoms is expected to improve treatment approach and is awaited. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This volume is the first published text bridging the gap between neuropsychological evaluation and intervention for children with emotional and behavior disorders. By filling this important informational void, the models presented herein adopt an integrated assessment–treatment paradigm that recognizes the complex interplay of genetics, neurodevelopment, and neuropsychological functioning. These integrated neuropsychological approaches are powerful for identifying and linking the multidetermined transactional brain–behavior pathways that result in typical or maladaptive functioning in the real world. Through recognition of the genetic and neurobiological vulnerabilities that interact with important environmental determinants of emotion and behavior, authors describe (a) the symptom dimensions of disorders in contrast to related disorders and conditions and (b) the differential diagnosis and disorder comorbidity through review of the salient biological (i.e., neurogenetic, neurochemical, neuroanatomical, and neuroimaging findings) and psychosocial factors (i.e., family environment and structure, parent–child attachment and interactions, peer interactions and relationships, school achievement). In addition, each chapter includes a proposed assessment and intervention framework, as well as a detailed disorder-specific case study that illustrates the step-by-step neuropsychological assessment and intervention integration process. The details of the clinical cases presented in the chapters have been changed to protect the anonymity of the clients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Occipital cortical thickness in very low birth weight born adolescents predicts altered neural specialization of visual semantic category related neural networks
AU  - Klaver, Peter

AU  - Martin, Ernst
T2  - Neuropsychologia
AB  - Very low birth weight (VLBW) premature born infants have a high risk to develop visual perceptual and learning deficits as well as widespread functional and structural brain abnormalities during infancy and childhood. Whether and how prematurity alters neural specialization within visual neural networks is still unknown. We used functional and structural brain imaging to examine the visual semantic system of VLBW born (< 1250 g, gestational age 25–32 weeks) adolescents (13–15 years, n = 11, 3 males) and matched term born control participants (13–15 years, n = 11, 3 males). Neurocognitive assessment revealed no group differences except for lower scores on an adaptive visuomotor integration test. All adolescents were scanned while viewing pictures of animals and tools and scrambled versions of these pictures. Both groups demonstrated animal and tool category related neural networks. Term born adolescents showed tool category related neural activity, i.e. tool pictures elicited more activity than animal pictures, in temporal and parietal brain areas. Animal category related activity was found in the occipital, temporal and frontal cortex. VLBW born adolescents showed reduced tool category related activity in the dorsal visual stream compared with controls, specifically the left anterior intraparietal sulcus, and enhanced animal category related activity in the left middle occipital gyrus and right lingual gyrus. Lower birth weight of VLBW adolescents correlated with larger thickness of the pericalcarine gyrus in the occipital cortex and smaller surface area of the superior temporal gyrus in the lateral temporal cortex. Moreover, larger thickness of the pericalcarine gyrus and smaller surface area of the superior temporal gyrus correlated with reduced tool category related activity in the parietal cortex. Together, our data suggest that very low birth weight predicts alterations of higher order visual semantic networks, particularly in the dorsal stream. The differences in neural specialization may be associated with aberrant cortical development of areas in the visual system that develop early in childhood.

By contrast patients with very early hippocampal damage and developmental amnesia are not impaired relative to control participants when imagining fictitious/future experiences. Recently, however, a patient (HC) with developmental amnesia, resulting from bilateral hippocampal atrophy, was reported to be impaired, thus raising a question about the true nature of event construction in the context of developmental amnesia. Here, we assessed HC on a test of imagination which explored her ability to construct fictitious events or personal plausible future events. Her scenario descriptions were analysed in detail along a range of parameters, using two different scoring methods. HC’s performance was comparable to matched control participants on all measures relating to the imagination of fictitious and future scenarios. We then considered why she was reported as impaired in the previous study. We conclude that various features of the previous testing methodology may have contributed to the underestimation of HC’s ability in that instance. Patients like HC with developmental amnesia may be successful at future-thinking tasks because their performance is not based on true visualisation or scene construction supported by the hippocampus, but rather on preserved world knowledge and semantic representations.

AB  - The neural dynamics in perceiving well-learned sequences and its modulation by task demand were investigated in this study in which participants were asked to observe stroke-by-stroke display of Chinese characters composed of two radicals while their brain activity was monitored with the event-related potential (ERP) technique. Experiment 1 used an accuracy judgment task that would draw participants' attention to the violation of the writing sequence whereas Experiment 2 required participants to judge the completion of the display and thus the more automatic aspects of sequence processing could be revealed. In Experiment 1, the within-radical boundary reversal produced bilateral posterior N2 enhancement and the cross-boundary reversal elicited a left N2 effect and right posterior N2 reduction on the critical stroke. Both types of reversal elicited P3 effects on the critical stroke and sustained negativity effects on the following stroke, with the size being larger for the cross-boundary reversal. In Experiment 2, in addition to the P3 effects, the within-boundary reversal elicited a left posterior N2 effect and the cross-boundary reversal elicited right posterior N2 reduction on the critical stroke. Moreover, on the following stroke, the cross-boundary reversal elicited a right N2 effect and both types of reversal elicited sustained positivity effects. These findings demonstrate that native Chinese readers use their sequential knowledge to predict upcoming strokes in perceiving the writing of characters and to construct appropriate representations for the action sequence regardless of whether such predictions and constructions are required by the task.

AB  - Faces are salient social stimuli whose features attract a stereotypical pattern of fixations. The implications of this gaze behavior for perception and brain activity are largely unknown. Here, we characterize and quantify a retinotopic bias implied by typical gaze behavior toward faces, which leads to eyes and mouth appearing most often in the upper and lower visual field, respectively. We found that the adult human visual system is tuned to these contingencies. In two recognition experiments, recognition performance for isolated face parts was better when they were presented at typical, rather than reversed, visual field locations. The recognition cost of reversed locations was equal to ~60% of that for whole face inversion in the same sample. Similarly, an fMRI experiment showed that patterns of activity evoked by eye and mouth stimuli in the right inferior occipital gyrus could be separated with significantly higher accuracy when these features were presented at typical, rather than reversed, visual field locations. Our findings demonstrate that human face perception is determined not only by the local position of features within a face context, but by whether features appear at the typical retinotopic location given normal gaze behavior. Such location sensitivity may reflect fine-tuning of category-specific visual processing to retinal input statistics. Our findings further suggest that retinotopic heterogeneity might play a role for face inversion effects and for the understanding of conditions affecting gaze behavior toward faces, such as autism spectrum disorders and congenital prosopagnosia.

T2  - Developmental Science
AB  - Adolescence is a period of profound change, which holds substantial developmental milestones, but also unique challenges to the individual. In this opinion paper, we highlight the potential of combining two recently developed behavioural and neural training techniques (cognitive bias modification and functional magnetic neuroimaging-based neurofeedback) into a research approach that could help make the most of increased levels of plasticity during childhood and adolescence. We discuss how this powerful combination could be used to explore changing brain–ehaviour relationships throughout development in the context of emotion processing, a cognitive domain that exhibits continuous development throughout the second decade of life. By targeting both behaviour and brain response, we would also be in an excellent position to define sensible time windows for enhancing plasticity, thereby allowing for targeted intervention approaches that can help improve emotion processing in both typically and atypically developing populations.

T2  - Memory
AB  - In two experiments, both employing deferred imitation, we studied the developmental origins of episodic memory in two- to three-year-old children by adopting a 'minimalist' view of episodic memory based on its What–When–Where ('WWW': spatiotemporal plus semantic) content. We argued that the temporal element within spatiotemporal should be the order/simultaneity of the event elements, but that it is not clear whether the spatial content should be egocentric or allocentric. We also argued that episodic recollection should be configural (tending towards all-or-nothing recall of the WWW elements). Our first deferred imitation experiment, using a two-dimensional (2D) display, produced superior-to-chance performance after 2.5 years but no evidence of configural memory. Moreover, performance did not differ from that on a What–What–What control task. Our second deferred imitation study required the children to reproduce actions on an object in a room, thereby affording layout-based spatial cues. In this case, not only was there superior-to-chance performance after 2.5 years but memory was also configural at both ages. We discuss the importance of allocentric spatial cues in episodic recall in early proto-episodic memory and reflect on the possible role of hippocampal development in this process.

AU  - Loewenstein, Jeffrey

T2  - Cognitive Psychology
AB  - We test the claim that learning and using language for spatial relations can influence spatial representation and reasoning. Preschool children were given a mapping task in which they were asked to find a 'winner' placed in a three-tiered box after seeing one placed in a virtually identical box. The correct choice was determined by finding the corresponding relative location in the test box, making it a difficult task for preschool children. We found that hearing language for spatial relations facilitated children's mapping performance. We found effects at younger ages on easier tasks (Experiments 1 and 2) and at older ages on harder tasks (Experiment 3). The effects of spatial relational language differed predictably according to the semantics of the terms children heard (Experiment 4). Finally, the effects of spatial language were maintained over time (Experiment 5): children given one initial exposure to the spatial terms maintained their advantage over baseline children when they again carried out the mapping task 2 days later, with no further exposure to the spatial terms. The evidence is consistent with the explanation that language bolsters children's spatial encodings, which in turn supports their mapping performance.

TI  - Representing relationality: Meg studies on argument structure
AU  - Williams, Adina
AB  - One of the quintessential properties of the human semantic system is its ability to flexibly combine the meanings of smaller pieces into larger wholes. However, not all smaller conceptual pieces are created equal; concepts differ in the extent to which they can drive meaning composition. Some concepts can drive semantic composition by establishing relationships with other concepts, while others cannot. For example, we know the concept labelled by 'friend' can drive composition, since one cannot be a friend without being someone's friend, while an animal can be a cat without standing in a similar relationship. We can thus divide the conceptual space of humans into two sections: relational concepts labelled by words like 'friend', and non-relational concepts like the one labelled by 'cat'. Evidence in favor of this division indicates that in early childhood humans are aware of the relationality of concepts (Smiley and Brown 1979; Mirman and Graziano 2012), and as we age, relational concepts remain extremely common in our lexicon, making up nearly half of the adult English vocabulary (Asmuth and Gentner, 2005; Gentner, 2005). Some relational words have been extensively studied by cognitive psychologists and formal linguists alike. One relatively mature set of investigations utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural basis of relational verb meaning, and finds that relational (i.e., transitive) verbs drive activity in left perisylvian cortical regions more than their intransitive counterparts (Meltzer-Asscher et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2010, 2007; Bornkessel et al., 2005; Ben-Shachar et al., 2003). These investigations attribute this activity to verb-specific or event-specific information that is stored as part of the verb's conceptual representation. Some support for this comes from Binder and Desai 2011 that holds that the left AG is a main semantic hub that specializes in event processing. However, formal linguistic investigations suggest that relationality should be independent of verbhood or eventivity; it is an independent abstract property of some lexical items which enables them to establish relationships and drive semantic composition. The neural basis of relationality and whether it can be independent of verbhood and eventivity is still relatively underexplored. As relationality straddles the boundary between syntax and semantics, disentangling the contributions of various linguistic features, such as syntactic category, eventivity, and plurality to left AG activity becomes a crucial exercise---one that a linguist is uniquely poised to address. A main candidate region for relational processing is the left Angular Gyrus (lAG), because prior literature suggests it is sensitive to at least some of the features that a region that processes relationality would be sensitive to. In addition to being implicated in tasks that probe the argument structure of verbs, the left AG was found to be the most consistently activated region across numerous semantic tasks in a recent, large-scale meta-analysis (Binder and Desai, 2011), prompting it to be dubbed a domain-general 'semantic' hub (Bonner et al., 2013; Binder and Desai, 2011). Because of this, this dissertation reports the results of three MEG experiments and one computational experiment, and focuses on the left AG and surrounding perisylvian cortical regions, and uses Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate its role in relational processing. Chapter 2 asks whether left AG tracks relationality, the eventivity of verbs, or a word's combinatorial context, and finds a main effect of relationality from 170--260 ms after the visual presentation of the target noun, and no other effects of the other factors, suggesting that it is indeed relationality and not eventivity (or context) that drives left AG argument structure findings. Chapter 3 asks… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The representation of autobiographical memory is distributed over a network of brain structures, with the medial temporal lobe (MTL) at its epicenter. Some believe that, over time, all memories become independent of their MTL component ('consolidation theories'). Others have suggested that this is true only of semantic memory, while episodic aspects of autobiographical memories are dependent on the MTL for as long as they exist, such as multiple trace theory (MTT). In the present study, the volumes of 28 brain regions, including the MTL, and their relation to autobiographical memory were investigated in a group of patients with Alzheimer's disease with varying degrees of retrograde memory loss as assessed by the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI). We used the multivariate analysis method of partial least squares (PLS) to assess patterns of atrophy that can lead to retrograde amnesia. We found that different aspects of autobiographical memory were associated with different patterns of tissue loss. Personal semantics were related to a pattern of bilateral anterior and posterior lateral temporal cortex degeneration, more pronounced on the left, as well as right frontal degeneration. Autobiographical event memory ('episodic') was associated with combined atrophy in bilateral MTL and anterior lateral temporal neocortex, more pronounced on the right. This pattern was invariant for memories from childhood, early adulthood, and recent memories, in line with the predictions of MTT, suggesting that MTL tissue is crucial for retrieval of episodic memories regardless of their age.

AB  - Reviews the book, Biographies of disease: Autism by Lisa D. Benaron (see record [rid]2009-01645-000[/rid]). This text starts with a solid historical review of the evolution of the concept of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), discusses currently available tools for the screening for ASD, and presents current research for screening in children younger than 18 months. The book then goes into a discussion of what we know about the causes so far, dividing them into either a basic science category (what is supported by basic science studies such as teratogenic factors, genetic causes, epigenetic causes, and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies) or the controversial theories category without this evidence base. Treatment is also discussed and reviewed as conventional and educational interventions as well as biomedical interventions. The current author feels that the book does a wonderful job in presenting current data, theories, results, and research in a simple and clear way. This book can be extremely helpful for pediatricians, fellows, clinicians working with children with ASD, DBP, and families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Dysfunctional patterns of activation in brain reward networks have been suggested as a core element in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear whether this dysfunction is specific to schizophrenia or can be continuously observed across persons with different levels of nonclinical and clinical symptom expression. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether the pattern of reward system dysfunction is consistent with a dimensional or categorical model of psychosis-like symptom expression. 23 patients with schizophrenia and 37 healthy control participants with varying levels of psychosis-like symptoms, separated into 3 groups of low, medium, and high symptom expression underwent event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a Cued Reinforcement Reaction Time task. We observed lower activation in the ventral striatum during the expectation of high vs no reward to be associated with higher symptom expression across all participants. No significant difference between patients with schizophrenia and healthy participants with high symptom expression was found. However, connectivity between the ventral striatum and the medial orbitofrontal cortex was specifically reduced in patients with schizophrenia. Dysfunctional local activation of the ventral striatum depends less on diagnostic category than on the degree of symptom expression, therefore showing a pattern consistent with a psychosis continuum. In contrast, aberrant connectivity in the reward system is specific to patients with schizophrenia, thereby supporting a categorical view. Thus, the results of the present study provide evidence for both continuous and discontinuous neural substrates of symptom expression across patients with schizophrenia and the general population.

AB  - The Simple View theory suggests that reading comprehension relies on automatic recognition of words combined with language comprehension. The goal of the current study was to examine the structural and functional connectivity in networks supporting reading comprehension and their relationship with language comprehension within 7-9 year old children using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and fMRI during a Sentence Picture Matching task. Fractional Anisotropy (FA) values in the left and right Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus (ILF) and Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF), known language-related tracts, were correlated from DTI data with scores from the Woodcock-Johnson III (WJ-III) Passage Comprehension sub-test. Brodmann areas most proximal to white-matter regions with significant correlation to Passage Comprehension scores were chosen as Regions-of-Interest (ROIs) and used as seeds in a functional connectivity analysis using the Sentence Picture Matching task. The correlation between percentile scores for the WJ-III Passage Comprehension subtest and the FA values in the right and left ILF and SLF indicated positive correlation in language-related ROIs, with greater distribution in the right hemisphere, which in turn showed strong connectivity in the fMRI data from the Sentence Picture Matching task. These results support the participation of the right hemisphere in reading comprehension and may provide physiologic support for a distinction between different types of reading comprehension deficits vs difficulties in technical reading.

T2  - Neuropsychologia
AB  - Amnesic patients with bilateral hippocampal damage sustained in adulthood are generally unable to construct scenes in their imagination. By contrast, patients with developmental amnesia (DA), where hippocampal damage was acquired early in life, have preserved performance on this task, although the reason for this sparing is unclear. One possibility is that residual function in remnant hippocampal tissue is sufficient to support basic scene construction in DA. Such a situation was found in the one amnesic patient with adult-acquired hippocampal damage (P01) who could also construct scenes. Alternatively, DA patients’ scene construction might not depend on the hippocampus, perhaps being instead reliant on non-hippocampal regions and mediated by semantic knowledge. To adjudicate between these two possibilities, we examined scene construction during functional MRI (fMRI) in Jon, a well-characterised patient with DA who has previously been shown to have preserved scene construction. We found that when Jon constructed scenes he activated many of the regions known to be associated with imagining scenes in control participants including ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, retrosplenial and posterior parietal cortices. Critically, however, activity was not increased in Jon's remnant hippocampal tissue. Direct comparisons with a group of control participants and patient P01, confirmed that they activated their right hippocampus more than Jon. Our results show that a type of non-hippocampal dependent scene construction is possible and occurs in DA, perhaps mediated by semantic memory, which does not appear to involve the vivid visualisation of imagined scenes.

T2  - Epidemiologia e Psichiatria Sociale
AB  - This editorial discusses evidence from epidemiological, genetic, and neuroimaging studies suggesting that schizophrenia is in part a neurodevelopmental disorder. But this is not the whole story. Schizophrenia etiology can be divided roughly into biological predisposing factors and psychosocial precipitating factors. In the category of biological factors one can find: genes, obstetric complications, lonely childhood, neurodevelopmental disturbances, and gender (severe schizophrenia is more common in males and age-of-onset is approximately 5 yrs earlier in males). Psychosocial factors appear to be: living in the city, abusing drugs, being an immigrant, and suffering an excess of traumatic life events. The author discusses various models of schizophrenia and explanations of its symptoms, ending with a description of a dimensional model by J. Van Os et al (1998), in which neurodevelopmental impairment is most prominent at the severe chronic schizophrenic pole and an affective-reactive factor at the other, manic-depressive pole. Such an interpretation allows for many mixed cases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Significant controversy has emerged concerning pediatric anxiety disorders. Some researchers question the justification for diagnosing and treating pediatric anxiety disorders, owing to concerns about the inappropriate medicalization of social problems. Others note the importance of diagnosis and treatment, given that pediatric anxiety disorders represent a strong risk factor for serious adult mental disorders. We examine the neural correlates of pediatric anxiety disorders, to consider the validity of the categorization scheme used in recent treatment studies. Methods: Using inclusion criteria derived from recent treatment trials, we compared gray matter volume throughout the brain in children with and without anxiety. Morphometric analyses used optimized voxel-based morphometry, an automated method for examining structural changes throughout the brain. Results: Reductions in left amygdala gray matter volume were noted for patients with anxiety disorders relative to comparison subjects. Conclusions: We discuss implications of these findings for current controversies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Self-control from 4 to 40
AU  - Woo, Theresa Teslovich
AB  - In our society, immediate gratification of needs and desires can be met across almost any domain. Whether one engages in these behaviors for pleasure or to reduce psychological pain, what may seem rewarding in the present may lead to long term suffering in the future when weight, substance abuse or other related health problems develop. Our youth are particularly vulnerable to these influences with the high prevalence of obesity in our elementary schools and illicit drug use already beginning in our middle schools. It is increasingly clear that early appearing self-regulatory abilities are associated with these behaviors and ultimately with long-term mental and physical health. However the core psychological constructs and neural substrates of self-regulation are not well understood. While self-control is typically described as a construct that increases linearly with age, recent studies have implicated the role of motivational cues in modulating an individual's capacity to self-regulate. This thesis examines the influence of motivational cues on self-control from childhood into adulthood. Namely, how motivational cues in our environment impact self-control and how their influence might vary across development and among individuals. Using a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging techniques we have found motivational cues can influence behavior in a number of ways. Specifically, developmental effects in both overall impulse control and sensitivity to motivational cues, result in differential modulation of behavior depending on age and class of motivator. While we have found food cue to be fairly consistent in salience across age groups and coincided with an overall increase in cognitive control abilities, rewards in the form of points, differentially modulated decision-making in adolescents and adults. Contrary to prior research that suggests teens are a hedonistically driven by their hypersensitivity to rewards, incapable of making good decisions, we observed an enhancement of behavior in adolescents when large rewards were at stake. In addition to the developmental effects of cue-mediated self-regulation, we investigate the extent to which motivational cues influence behavior on an individual level. Differences in appetitive cue sensitivity established early in life were found to influence long-term cognitive control abilities. This provocative correlation was associated with distinct patterns of activity in frontrostriatal circuitry and proposes a mechanism for self-regulation that incorporates individual sensitivity to appetitive cues in our environment. These findings suggest that the salience of a specific category of cues (e.g., food, rewards, and social cues) changes across development and speaks to the importance of enhancing self-control to these cues in special populations where this ability may be compromised or diminished (e.g., obesity, bulimia, anorexia nervosa).

AB  - Semantic association, an essential element of human language, enables discourse and inference. Neuroimaging studies have revealed localization and lateralization of semantic circuitry, making substantial contributions to cognitive neuroscience. However, because of methodological limitations, these investigations have only identified individual functional components rather than capturing the behavior of the entire network. To overcome these limitations, we have implemented group independent component analysis (ICA) to investigate the cognitive modules used by healthy adults performing the fMRI semantic decision task. When compared with the results of a standard general linear modeling (GLM) analysis, ICA detected several additional brain regions subserving semantic decision. Eight task-related group ICA maps were identified, including left inferior frontal gyrus (BA44/45), middle posterior temporal gyrus (BA39/22), angular gyrus/ inferior parietal lobule (BA39/40), posterior cingulate (BA30), bilateral lingual gyrus (BA18/23), inferior frontal gyrus (L > R, BA47), hippocampus with parahippocampal gyrus (L > R, BA35/36), and anterior cingulate (BA32/24). Although most of the components were represented bilaterally, we found a single, highly left-lateralized component that included the inferior frontal gyrus and the medial and superior temporal gyri, the angular and supramarginal gyri, and the inferior parietal cortex. The presence of these spatially independent ICA components implies functional connectivity and can be equated with their modularity. These results are analyzed and presented in the framework of a biologically plausible theoretical model in preparation for similar analyses in patients with right- or left-hemispheric epilepsies .

AB  - Memory tasks can be performed using multiple cognitive strategies, which are mediated by different brain systems. The transverse patterning (TP) task is dependent upon the integrity of the hippocampal system, however, we previously demonstrated successful TP following hippocampal damage using meaningful stimuli and relations (Moses, S.N., Ostreicher, M.L., Rosenbaum, R.S., Ryan, J.D., 2008. Successful transverse patterning in amnesia using semantic knowledge. Hippocampus 18, 121–124). Here, we used magnetoencephalgraphy (MEG) to directly observe the neural underpinnings of TP, and the changes that occur as stimuli and relations become more meaningful. In order to optimize our ability to detect signal from deep, non-dominant, brain sources we implemented the event-related synthetic aperture magnetometry minimum-variance beamformer algorithm (ER-SAM; Cheyne, D., Bakhtazad, L., Gaetz, W., 2006. Spatiotemporal mapping of cortical activity accompanying voluntary movements using an event-related beamforming approach. Human Brain Mapping 27, 213–229) coupled with the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate statistical approach (McIntosh, A.R., Bookstein, F.L., Haxby, J.V., Grady, C.L., 1996. Spatial pattern analysis of function brain images using partial least squares. NeuroImage 3, 143–157; McIntosh, A.R., Lobaugh, N.J., 2004. Partial least squares analysis of neuroimaging data: Applications and advances. NeuroImage 23, S250–S263). We found that increased meaningfulness elicited reduced bilateral hippocampal activation, along with increased activation of left prefrontal and temporal cortical structures, including inferior frontal (IFG), as well as anterior temporal and perirhinal cortices. These activation patterns may represent a shift towards reliance upon existing semantic knowledge. This shift likely permits successful TP performance with meaningful stimuli and relations following hippocampal damage. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Typical adult observers demonstrate enhanced behavioral sensitivity to human movement compared to animal movement. Yet, the neural underpinnings of this effect are unknown. We examined the tuning of brain mechanisms for the perception of biological motion to the social relevance of this category of motion by comparing neural response to human and non-human biological motion. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that the response of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) varies according to the social relevance of the motion, responding most strongly to those biological motions with the greatest social relevance (human > dog). During a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session, typical adults viewed veridical point-light displays of human, dog, and tractor motions created from motion capture data. A conjunction analysis identified regions of significant activation during biological motion perception relative to object motion. Within each of these regions, only one brain area, the right pSTS, revealed an enhanced response to human motion relative to dog motion. This finding demonstrates that the pSTS response is sensitive to the social relevance of a biological motion stimulus. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology
AB  - A total of 8 participants were tested using magnetoencephalography for investigating the spatial, temporal, and frequency signatures of noun and verb processing in the brain. Visually presented nouns and verbs both activated the occipital, left posterior temporal, and left inferior frontal cortices at a latency range of 106–329 ms in a frequency range of 24–98 Hz. Nouns activated the left posterior temporal area while verbs activated the inferior left frontal area at a latency range of 411–430 ms in a frequency range of 116–137 Hz. Nouns and verbs were processed in similar brain areas during early latency and relatively low frequency, but were processed in different brain areas during late latency and high frequency. The results indicate that there are distinct neural substrates underlying different aspects of the language system. This finding sheds light on the cerebral mechanisms of impairments of selective word categories in patients with brain damage in clinical neuropsychology.

AB  - Episodic-autobiographical memory (AM) is characterized by self-conscious reflection, emotional connotation and mental time travel. Semantic memory (SM) contains context and emotion free general knowledge. The present study specifically aimed at exploring the effect of time on the neural substrates of autobiographical and semantic memory retrieval by studying memories from different life periods in young female participants using functional brain imaging. Recent compared to early childhood events activated retrosplenial cortex. More importantly, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) was specifically engaged in the retrieval of recent AMs. The data show time-modulated neural substrates during recent and remote memories in women and suggest that a specific MPFC activation underlies the autonoetic, emotional and self-related character of recent AMs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent neuroimaging work has suggested that aggressive behaviour (AB) is associated with structural and functional brain abnormalities in processes subserving emotion processing and regulation. However, most neuroimaging studies on AB to date only contain relatively small sample sizes. To objectively investigate the consistency of previous structural and functional research in adolescent AB, we performed a systematic literature review and two coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses on eight VBM and nine functional neuroimaging studies in a total of 783 participants (408 [224AB/184 controls] and 375 [215 AB/160 controls] for structural and functional analysis respectively). We found 19 structural and eight functional foci of significant alterations in adolescents with AB, mainly located within the emotion processing and regulation network (including orbitofrontal, dorsomedial prefrontal and limbic cortex). A subsequent conjunction analysis revealed that functional and structural alterations co-localize in right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and left insula. Our results are in line with meta-analytic work as well as structural, functional and connectivity findings to date, all of which make a strong point for the involvement of a network of brain areas responsible for emotion processing and regulation, which is disrupted in AB. Increased knowledge about the behavioural and neuronal underpinnings of AB is crucial for the development of novel and implementation of existing treatment strategies. Longitudinal research studies will have to show whether the observed alterations are a result or primary cause of the phenotypic characteristics in AB.

AB  - Extensive preclinical data implicate corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), acting through its CRH1 receptor, in stress- and dependence-induced alcohol seeking. We evaluated pexacerfont, an orally available, brain penetrant CRH1 antagonist for its ability to suppress stress-induced alcohol craving and brain responses in treatment seeking alcohol-dependent patients in early abstinence. Fifty-four anxious alcohol-dependent participants were admitted to an inpatient unit at the NIH Clinical Center, completed withdrawal treatment, and were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with pexacerfont (300 mg/day for 7 days, followed by 100 mg/day for 23 days). After reaching steady state, participants were assessed for alcohol craving in response to stressful or alcohol-related cues, neuroendocrine responses to these stimuli, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to alcohol-related stimuli or stimuli with positive or negative emotional valence. A separate group of 10 patients received open-label pexacerfont following the same dosing regimen and had cerebrospinal fluid sampled to estimate central nervous system exposure. Pexacerfont treatment had no effect on alcohol craving, emotional responses, or anxiety. There was no effect of pexacerfont on neural responses to alcohol-related or affective stimuli. These results were obtained despite drug levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that predict close to 90% central CRH1 receptor occupancy. CRH1 antagonists have been grouped based on their receptor dissociation kinetics, with pexacerfont falling in a category characterized by fast dissociation. Our results may indicate that antagonists with slow offset are required for therapeutic efficacy. Alternatively, the extensive preclinical data on CRH1 antagonism as a mechanism to suppress alcohol seeking may not translate to humans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: This study examined the effects of age and two novel factors (intensity and emotion category) on healthy children's developing emotion-processing from 4 to 15 years using two matching paradigms. Methods: An explicit emotion-matching task was employed in which children matched the emotion of a target individual, and an implicit task whereby participants ignored the emotive facial stimulus and matched identity. Four intensities (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) for each of five emotion categories (sad, anger, happy, fear, and disgust) were included and provided a novel avenue of emotion-processing exploration. Results: Increasing age significantly improved children's performance on both tasks, particularly for fear and disgust. Age was not associated with more subtle processing (i.e., lower intensity of expression). When explicitly matching emotion expressions, increasing intensity was associated with improved performance. When matching identities (implicit emotion-matching), emotion category and intensity influenced task performance. Sex effects were minimal. Conclusions: In children, age, facial expression intensity and emotion category are important for predicting accuracy on emotion-processing tasks. Emotion category and expression intensity differentially affect performance on explicit and implicit emotion-processing tasks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to examine differences between 5 male children (aged 9-12 yrs) and 4 male adults (aged 21-31 yrs) in the distribution of brain activation during word processing. Orthographic, phonologic, semantic and syntactic tasks were used in both the auditory and visual modalities. The 2 principal results were consistent with the hypothesis that development is characterized by increasing specialization. The 1st analysis compared activation in children versus adults separately for each modality. Adults show more activation in the unimodal visual areas of middle temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus for processing written word forms and in the unimodal auditory areas of superior temporal gyrus for processing spoken word forms. Children show more activation for written word forms in posterior heteromodal regions. The 2nd analysis compared activation in the visual versus auditory modality separately for children and adults. Children show overlap of activation in brain regions for the visual and auditory tasks. Adults show selective activation in the unimodal auditory areas of superior temporal gyrus when processing spoken word forms and selective activation in the unimodal visual areas of middle temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus when processing written word forms.

T2  - Epilepsy & Behavior
AB  - Chronic and progressive brain injury, as seen in epilepsy, may alter brain networks that underlie cognitive functions. To evaluate the effect of epilepsy on language functions we investigated the neuroanatomical basis of semantic processing in patients with left (LHE) or right (RHE) hemispheric onset epilepsy using semantic decision fMRI paradigm and group independent component analysis (ICA); we then compared the results of our investigations with language networks in healthy subjects examined with the same language task (Kim K, Karunanayaka P, Privitera M, Holland S, Szaflarski J. Semantic association investigated with fMRI and independent component analysis. In press). Group ICA is a data-driven technique capable of revealing the functional organization of the human brain based on fMRI data. In addition to providing functional connectivity information, ICA can also provide information about the temporal dynamics of underlying networks subserving specific cognitive functions. In this study, we implemented two complementary analyses to investigate group differences in underlying network dynamics based on associated independent component (IC) time courses (a priori defined criterion or a posteriori identified maximum likelihood descriptor). We detected several differences between healthy controls and patients with epilepsy not previously observed with standard fMRI analysis methods. Our analyses confirmed the presence of different effects of LHE or RHE on the behavior of the language network. In particular, a major difference was noted in the nodes subserving verbal encoding and retrieval in the bilateral medial temporal regions. These effects were dependent on the side of the epilepsy onset; that is, effects were different with left or right hemispheric epilepsy. These findings may explain the differences in verbal and nonverbal memory abilities between patients with left and those with right hemispheric epilepsy. Further, although the effects on other nodes of the network were more subtle, several deviations from normal network function were observed in patients with LHE (e.g., alterations in the functions of the primarily left frontotemporal network module) or in patients with RHE (e.g., differences in the medial retrosplenial module responsible for mental imagery or in the anterior cingulate module subserving attention control). These findings not only highlight the negative effects of epilepsy on the main left hemispheric language network nodes in patients with LHE, but also document the effects of epilepsy on other language network nodes whether exerted by LHE or RHE. Further, these results document the advantages of using group ICA for investigating the effects of disease state (e.g., epilepsy) on the network subserving cognitive processing and provide an interesting avenue for further exploration.

T2  - BMC Neuroscience
AB  - Background: To examine which language function depends on early experience, the present study compared deaf native signers, deaf non-native signers and hearing German native speakers while processing German sentences. The participants watched simple written sentences while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. At the end of each sentence they were asked to judge whether the sentence was correct or not. Two types of violations were introduced in the middle of the sentence: a semantically implausible noun or a violation of subject-verb number agreement. Results: The results showed a similar ERP pattern after semantic violations (an N400 followed by a positivity) in all three groups. After syntactic violations, native German speakers and native signers of German sign language (DGS) with German as second language (L2) showed a left anterior negativity (LAN) followed by a P600, whereas no LAN but a negativity over the right hemisphere instead was found in deaf participants with a delayed onset of first language (L1) acquisition. The P600 of this group had a smaller amplitude and a different scalp distribution as compared to German native speakers. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that language deprivation in early childhood alters the cerebral organization of syntactic language processing mechanisms for L2. Semantic language processing instead was unaffected. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The neural basis of compositionality: Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of conceptual combination
AU  - Baron, Sean G.
AB  - The use of concepts underlies the most basic cognitive processes. Consequently, psychologists have long been interested in understanding the behavioral and neural correlates of conceptual knowledge and its manipulation. This has led to a rich set of research results that have expanded our understanding of concepts. However, upon reviewing this literature it is clear that little of it expressly addresses the neural basis of conceptual combination. Conceptual combination is the mental construction of complex concepts (e.g.,  GRADUATE STUDENT) from simpler constituents (e.g., GRADUATE and STUDENT). The process of conceptual combination serves as the foundation for human conceptual creativity—our ability to create an infinite number of new ideas from a limited set. Across three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, I explore the neural basis of basic conceptual combination. In the first I prove the feasibility of using fMRI to examine modifier-substantive combinations, and provide evidence for multiplicative combination (e.g., YOUNG ×  MAN → YOUNG MAN) in the left anterior temporal lobe. Studies two and three utilize non-phonologically dependent concepts (e.g., MALE × CHILD →  BOY and WILD × BIRD →  EAGLE) and also point to the left anterior temporal lobe as a likely site of conceptual combination. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of the left anterior temporal lobe in conceptual combination, and also reveal a way for the cortex to store and process complex concepts in a non-redundant fashion.

AU  - Giller, Franziska

T2  - Human Brain Mapping
AB  - Cognitive flexibility is a major facet of executive functions and often refers to sequential task control; that is, it is very likely that one may re‐encounter a task that has previously been abandoned to carry out a different task. In the context of sequential cognitive flexibility, the 'backward inhibition (BI) effect' has been studied quite extensively. Here we ask whether there are age‐related differences between adolescents and adults to overcome BI and what system‐neurophysiological mechanisms underlie these modulations. This was examined using a system neurophysiological study procedure combining event‐related potentials data with source localization and EEG signal decomposition methods. We show that sequential cognitive flexibility, and the ability overcome backward inhibition, is inferior in adolescents compared with adults. Accounting for intra‐individual variability in the neurophysiological data, this data suggest that two partly inter‐related processes underlie the differences between adolescents than adults to overcome backward inhibition: One process refers to the suppression of the inhibitory effect of the n‐1 trial on the n‐2 trial during perceptual categorization of incoming information that is associated with right inferior frontal regions. The other process refers to immature response selection and conflict monitoring mechanisms associated with regions in the medial frontal cortex.

AB  - The present study was the first to use the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodology to investigate the neural correlates of race categorization of own- and other-race faces. We found that Chinese participants categorized the race of Caucasian faces more accurately and faster than that of Chinese faces, replicating the robust effect of the other-race categorization advantage. Regions of interest (ROI) analyses revealed greater neural activations when participants were categorizing own-race faces than other-race faces in the bilateral ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOT) such as the fusiform face areas (FFAs) and the occipital face areas (OFAs). Within the left FFA, there was also a significant negative correlation between the behavioral difference of own- and other-race face categorization accuracy and the activation difference between categorizing own- and other-race faces. Whole brain analyses showed that categorizing own-race faces induced greater activations in the right medial frontal cortex (MFC) and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) than categorizing other-race faces. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses revealed that the frontal cortical regions interacted more strongly with the posterior VOT during the categorization of own-race faces than that of other-race faces. Overall, our findings suggest that relative to the categorization of other-race faces, more cortical resources are engaged during the categorization of own-race faces with which we have a higher level of processing expertise. This increased involvement of cortical neural sources perhaps serves to provide more in-depth processing of own-race faces (such as individuation), which in turn paradoxically results in the behavioral other-race categorization advantage.

TI  - The place of childhood disintegrative disorder on the autism spectrum
AU  - Westphal, Alexander R. N.
AB  - The use of the term 'spectrum' to describe autism spectrum disorders (ASD) captures the heterogeneity of presentations, including differences in cognitive level and onset pattern, but also implies homogeneity of pathophysiology. Most research on ASD has been conducted on subjects with intact cognitive function, and has been thought to be generalizable to the low functioning population. However, the rarest ASD, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD), has a pattern of onset unlike other ASDs, and is also associated with the severest intellectual and adaptive disabilities of any spectrum disorder, raising the possibility that there may be a pathophysiological pathway to autistic behavior in some low functioning individuals different than the one defined in the high functioning population. Very little is known about CDD, in part because of its rarity, and the utility of the diagnostic category has been questioned. The purpose of this thesis was to examine relationship between CDD and the autism spectrum in several ways. The first several chapters include a literature review and a clinical description of a group of children with CDD seen at the Yale Child Study Center. The clinical description includes information about the characteristics of the onset of CDD, and comparisons of outcome between CDD and other ASDs. The following chapters are an eye-tracking study and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study that compare the way in which subjects with CDD process faces relative to people with other forms of ASD and typical development. Although subjects with CDD do appear similar to other subjects with ASD and low IQ on a variety of clinical measures, the findings demonstrate that they have a distinct way of exploring faces, focusing on the eyes even more so than typical subjects, and they also have differences in their brain activations to faces and houses. Together the eye-tracking and fMRI results suggest the possibility that vestiges of typical brain function exist in subjects with CDD, despite the severity of their autism symptoms. Overall, the findings emphasize the value or maintaining a diagnostic distinction between CDD and other forms of ASD until the evidence says otherwise.

AB  - Context: During the past 2 decades, a major transition in the clinical characterization of psychotic disorders has occurred. The construct of a clinical high-risk (HR) state for psychosis has evolved to capture the prepsychotic phase, describing people presenting with potentially prodromal symptoms. The importance of this HR state has been increasingly recognized to such an extent that a new syndrome is being considered as a diagnostic category in the DSM-5. Objective: To reframe the HR state in a comprehensive state-of-the-art review on the progress that has been made while also recognizing the challenges that remain. Data Sources: Available HR research of the past 20 years from PubMed, books, meetings, abstracts, and international conferences. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Critical review of HR studies addressing historical development, inclusion criteria, epidemiologic research, transition criteria, outcomes, clinical and functional characteristics, neurocognition, neuroimaging, predictors of psychosis development, treatment trials, socioeconomic aspects, nosography, and future challenges in the field. Data Synthesis: Relevant articles retrieved in the literature search were discussed by a large group of leading worldwide experts in the field. The core results are presented after consensus and are summarized in illustrative tables and figures. Conclusions: The relatively new field of HR research in psychosis is exciting. It has the potential to shed light on the development of major psychotic disorders and to alter their course. It also provides a rationale for service provision to those in need of help who could not previously access it and the possibility of changing trajectories for those with vulnerability to psychotic illnesses.

It is the mechanism of language processing through which people apply meaning to their sensory and productive experiences of spoken and written words, viewed objects, and gestures. The authors focus their review on studies in cognitive neuropsychology that have provided evidence of the structure and function of the semantic system, using studies of individuals with brain impairment.  Topics include: a historical perspective; modern perspectives on the semantic system (unitary semantics, modality-specific semantics); semantic impairments (transcortical sensory aphasia, anomic aphasia, language impairment in dementia); neuroanatomy of semantics (evidence from acquired lesions, neuroimaging studies of semantic processing); application of theory to practice (prognosis for recovery from semantic impairments, assessment of semantic functioning, management of semantic impairments).

AU  - Klin, Ami

AB  - Comments on the article by K. Pierce and E. Redcay (see record [rid]2008-12975-002[/rid]), which measured brain activity (using fMRI imaging) while 6- to 12-year-old children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and typical control subjects viewed pictures of faces. Pierce and Redcay raise a number of important questions that every fMRI researcher of face processing in ASD should consider in their studies: (1) Is visual attention a confound in studies of neural responses to faces in ASD?; (2) Is motivation a confound in studies of neural responses to faces in ASD?; and (3) Is the fusiform gyrus a brain module exclusively tied to face processing? Pierce and Redcay's results are important in that they bring us to a higher level of scrutiny of fMRI studies of face processing in ASD. It is hoped that their allusion to important developmental considerations will prompt us to remember that our brains not only reflect what we are now, they also reflect what we have been.

TI  - Towards connectionist neuroimaging: Brain connector hubs for expressive language
AU  - Williamson, Brady J.
AB  - Many models attempting to characterize the neural correlates of cognition focus on localizing functions, but few address the question of how the localized regions take part in the network as a whole. Models of language in the brain have existed for nearly 150 years and most fall into this category. While early research was limited to postmortem studies of pathology, the advent of neuroimaging has allowed researchers to investigate brain function in vivo and in healthy populations as well as those with pathology. Even with this advance, many researchers have still largely focused on localization of function. Recently, there has been a paradigmatic shift from activation-based to connectivity-based analyses of neuroimaging data, emphasizing investigation of how different brain regions interact. When conceptualizing the brain as a network, some regions emerge as important for communication between functionally specialized neural populations. These areas are known as connector hubs. While connector hubs have been acknowledged for several years, they are rarely characterized, especially in the context of a specific cognitive function. The current study aims to characterize connector hubs in the pediatric language network, observe their developmental trajectory, and assess their relationship with age-corrected language performance. Data from an existing study were used that included neuroimaging (MRI, fMRI, diffusion MRI or dMRI, MEG) and standardized language assessment (EVT) data for 15 young children (4-6 years) and 15 adolescents (16-18 years). A data-driven, connectivity-based pipeline was developed to characterize connector hubs during an expressive language task. After initial preprocessing, connectivity matrices were calculated for MEG (functional) and dMRI (structural) data. Functional connectivity was calculated using amplitude-amplitude correlation (AAC) within and between 4 different frequency bins (2-4, 4-12, 12-30, 30-100 Hz) to capture intra- and inter- frequency connectivity. Each functional connectivity matrix was then multiplied (entry-wise) by a threholded and binarized structural connectivity matrix to keep only biologically-plausible connections. Finally, the matrices were combined into a multilayer network and graph analyses were performed to identify connector hubs. Results showed good overlap of connector hubs with vetted fMRI-derived maps, though the current pipeline was more consistent across individuals. Additionally, connector hub distribution became more left lateralized, cortical, and focal, with age. Connector hubs in regions thought to be involved in expressive language were significantly correlated with EVT performance in adolescents but not young children. Overall, the results suggest that the expressive language network becomes more focal and efficient during development, a process potentially mediated by central and subcortical regions. Comprehensive characterization of connector hubs and how they change during childhood has important clinical and computational applications. Cutting-edge neuroimaging analyses combined with new developments in connectionist modeling may lead to a better understanding of how neurophysiology leads to cognition.

AB  - Dyslexics have problems with categorization of speech sounds, in particular when rapid temporal processing is involved such as in formant transitions of stop-consonants. Infants are already sensitive to such auditory features, but here we show that precursors of impaired categorization are already present in the brain responses of two-month-old infants at familial risk for dyslexia. Natural speech stimuli (/bAk/ and /dAk/), at either side of the phoneme boundary, induced multiple mismatch responses in control infants under pre-attentive and pre-cognitive conditions. Infants at-risk showed an attenuated early mismatch response and an absent late one, in addition to diminished cortical activity in the left hemisphere. These results are consistent with a temporal processing deficit in the infants at risk and may point to an early precursor of the disorder.

AB  - Booth and Burman address the neural correlates of reading and language processing. They present a series of experiments that investigated the developmental differences between adults and children in neural functioning for lexical processing. Their results support a developmental model that proposes a decreased reliance on semantics and an increased interactivity between orthographic and phonological representations in rapid word recognition with age. Their findings are also consistent with developmental models of reading and spelling that postulate single rather than dual routes for converting between representational systems. Their work shows how behavioral and brain activation measures can be used in conjunction to test developmental models of reading acquisition.

AU  - Shetreet, Einat

AU  - Gaab, Nadine
T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - Both numerals and quantifiers (like some) have more than one possible interpretation (i.e., weak and strong interpretations). Some studies have found similar behavior for numerals and quantifiers, whereas others have shown critical differences. It is, therefore, debated whether they are processed in the same way. A previous fMRI investigation showed that the left inferior frontal gyrus is linked to the computation of the strong interpretation of quantifiers (derived by a scalar implicature) and that the left middle frontal gyrus and the medial frontal gyrus are linked to processing the mismatch between the strong interpretation of quantifiers and the context in which they are presented. In the current study, we attempted to characterize the similarities and differences between numbers and quantifiers by examining brain activation patterns related to the processing of numerals in these brain regions. When numbers were presented in a mismatch context (i.e., where their strong interpretation did not match the context), they elicited brain activations similar to those previously observed with quantifiers in the same context type. Conversely, in a match context (i.e., where both interpretations of the scalar item matched the context), numbers elicited a different activation pattern than the one observed with quantifiers: Left inferior frontal gyrus activations in response to the match condition showed decrease for numbers (but not for quantifiers). Our results support previous findings suggesting that, although they share some features, numbers and quantifiers are processed differently. We discuss our results in light of various theoretical approaches linked to the representation of numerals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: This study examined white matter (WM) structural and metabolic alterations in relation to cognition in patients with non-neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (non-NPSLE). Background: SLE can produce cognitive impairment even without overt neuropsychiatric features, but the pathogenesis of this dysfunction is not well understood. Our preliminary study of non-NPSLE found evidence correlating cognitive impairment with increased choline/creatine (Ch/Cr) in frontal lobe WM. Methods: Subjects included 60 non-NPSLE patients and 24 controls. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed, and a battery of neuropsychologic tests was administered. Structural and metabolic measures were analyzed and correlated with neuropsychologic data. Results: No significant differences were found in total brain, gray matter, and WM volumes, or in frontal WM N-acetyl-aspartate/Cr, but the non-NPSLE group had significantly increased Ch/Cr in frontal WM. A WM cognitive score (WMCS) that included the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task, Letter Fluency, and Animal Naming was found to correlate with total WM volume, and lower WMCS correlated with higher left frontal WM Ch/Cr. Conclusions: Non-NPSLE patients had frontal WM metabolic changes that correlated with cognitive impairment, whereas no cerebral atrophy or WM axonal damage was evident. These data confirm and extend our previous observations supporting the role of microstructural WM changes in the cognitive impairment of non-NPSLE patients. The data also suggest that the WMCS may be sensitive to cognitive dysfunction from myelin damage that develops before axonal injury. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Will neuroscience account for the psychotherapeutic outcome in schizophrenia?
AU  - Bomba, Jacek

T2  - Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy
AB  - Neuroscientific research explaining the effectiveness of psychotherapy went in three directions. The first, basing on a theory of explicit (declarative, conscious) and implicit (procedural, subconscious) memory aims at reinterpretation of the mechanisms of psychotherapy. This method is useful in analysing effects of cognitive psychotherapy but also psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy which is based on interpretations and insight. The second current in such research is connected with the possibility of neuroimaging, which allows to evaluate changes occurring in the course of therapy. This method enables to show biological mechanisms of therapeutic alliance or reduction of basic anxiety. In the third category of studies, changes in cerebral metabolism that occur due to psychotropic medication and psychotherapy are observed with the aid of neuroimaging. Here, the findings are extremely interesting, for instance, in treatment of depression psychotherapy brings about more specific changes than anti-depression drugs. Most of the investigation is focused on the effects of psychotherapy for patients suffering from depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder because of high homogeneity of these disorders. Schizophrenia-related disorders are less homogeneous, and owing to that drafting a research plan is a much more complicated task. So the path towards neuroscience, which may account for the effects of psychotherapy, is still unexplored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

The first question I derive from the seven insightful commentaries on my paper concerns the extent to which my experience of inadvertently perpetuating trauma through memoir writing can or should serve as a cautionary tale for others. To engage in psychotherapy means to work with another person. Some writers have editors and some writers regularly share work with peers in writing groups. Indeed it can be argued that most writers generally benefit from occasionally breaking the potentially solipsistic self-enclosure of their creative worlds. By this argument, an attempt to build a bridge between the empirical and psychoanalytic levels is a category error equivalent to explaining, for example, my love for my daughter in terms of the limbic system. Perhaps a future memoirist will publish his mother's functional magnetic resonance imaging scans and genomic analysis. But I doubt that forgiveness will ever come in a pill.

AB  - One of the most important social identities that children learn to define themselves  and others by is sex, becoming a salient social category by early childhood.  Although older children begin to show greater flexibility in their gendered  behaviors and attitudes, gender rigidity intensifies again around the time of  puberty. In the current study, we assessed behavioral and neural biases to sex  across a wide age group. Ninety-three youth (ages 7-17 years) provided behavioral  rating of same- and opposite-sex attitudes, and 52 youth (ages 4-18 years) underwent  an fMRI scan as they matched the emotion of same- and opposite-sex faces. We  demonstrate significant age-related behavioral biases of sex that are mediated by  differential amygdala response to opposite-sex relative to same-sex faces in  children, an effect that completely attenuates by the teenage years. Moreover, we  find a second peak in amygdala sensitivity to opposite-sex faces around the time of  puberty. Thus, the amygdala codes for developmentally dependent and motivationally  relevant social identification across development.

AB  - A region in the lateral aspect of the fusiform gyrus (FG) is more engaged by human  faces than any other category of image. It has come to be known as the 'fusiform  face area' (FFA). The origin and extent of this specialization is currently a topic  of great interest and debate. This is of special relevance to autism, because recent  studies have shown that the FFA is hypoactive to faces in this disorder. In two  linked functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of healthy young adults,  we show here that the FFA is engaged by a social attribution task (SAT) involving  perception of human-like interactions among three simple geometric shapes. The  amygdala, temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex, inferolateral frontal cortex and  superior temporal sulci were also significantly engaged. Activation of the FFA to a  task without faces challenges the received view that the FFA is restricted in its  activities to the perception of faces. We speculate that abstract semantic  information associated with faces is encoded in the FG region and retrieved for  social computations. From this perspective, the literature on hypoactivation of the  FFA in autism may be interpreted as a reflection of a core social cognitive  mechanism underlying the disorder.
