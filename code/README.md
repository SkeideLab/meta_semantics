This directory contains the Python scripts that we have created to perform the different aspects of our meta-analysis. Please feel free to explore and reuse bits of this code. If you want to recreate our results from scratch, make sure to start with `nb01_ale.py` and then move on to any of the other notebooks. The `run_hpc.sh` file is a shell script that we used internally to run all of these scripts at once on a high performance computing (HPC) cluster. Thus, please do not expect this file to work on your local machine or on a cloud server.
